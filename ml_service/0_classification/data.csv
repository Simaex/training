One of which is the potential divestiture of that business.,pos,train
So first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter.,pos,train

But you shouldn't be surprised to see investments in both cores as we take and try to extend these business models further,pos,train
"When you look at methanol, the methanol-MTO leak is the most important equation because really, it’s going to tell you about incremental methanol value in China, sets that floor, which has a big ripple effect around the world for the chain business that’s out there",pos,train

"But we certainly will be able to balance it, protect it more, and I hope at some point in the future be able to annuitize it and kind of take the pension accounting a little bit off the table",pos,train

"And we're looking at both early-stage assets and in fact this year, we've done a number of early-stage assets in oncology and in neuroscience",pos,train
"It’s not the only places that we're looking, but it certainly is an area that's a high priority and we'll obviously look at other kinds of transactions as well, and certainly your points are valid one as our P/E has risen, it does give more flexibility to do other things",pos,train

"Based on our strong cash flow generation, we also anticipate an increase in our return of capital to our shareholders and we will be announcing those specific details in the near future",pos,train
"And as Rick said, our cash balances are going to grow pretty fast on top of that, so I think we're in pretty good shape from a balance sheet standpoint",pos,train
"I think MAVYRET is a good example of the kinds of products that we're bringing to the marketplace and the impact that they can have on patients most importantly, but the impact that they can have financially on the business",pos,train

"There is also continued movement with our early-stage immunology programs, where we are developing assets with the potential to significantly raise the efficacy bar in areas such as disease remission and durability of response, compared to products currently on the market and in late-stage development",pos,train

And so we are always looking at what we can do to be able to do that,pos,test
So I would expect and hope price stability going forward,pos,train
"Now if you look at our late-stage pipeline, we clearly have confidence that we can do that, but we are constantly looking at what is out there that fits our strategy both within the franchises that we operate in as well as we have a program internally, we call new horizons, where we look at other verticals that might fit what we’re good at",pos,train
"I would say our primary focus is looking for opportunities that can drive strong growth in that 2023, 2024, 2025 time frame that's we feel confident that we can drive growth with our late-stage pipeline ahead of that",pos,train
We've also said that we will compete for volume within certain parameters to try to maintain the volume and ultimately maximize profitability of the brand,pos,train

"In 2018, we will be investing in order to maximize the sales potential of assets launching in 2018 and 2019",pos,train
"In addition, we will be making investments and anticipation of immunology and oncology launches in 2019",pos,train

"Of course, we are also going to design a program that leads to registration in other jurisdictions around the world and all that work is currently underway",pos,train
"So you will see some impact on price, it should be offset in most cases by volume, and that's what we have described as a proactive actions that we will take",pos,train
"Now having said that, I would also tell you that we always look at the return that we can get out of a transaction and it has to meet our internal financial criteria or we're not willing to go down a path to acquire something that doesn't give us the kind of accretion that we're looking for and the kind of return that we're looking for",pos,train
"In immunology, we continue to make great progress with our late-stage assets, risankizumab and upadacitinib, as well as with our early immunology pipeline",pos,train
"The cash flow will be hitting in the next five years, so that’s one area that would be a little different",pos,train
"Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995",pos,train
"And Geoff on the balance sheet, look we are pretty comfortable with our balance sheet, right now we've got as Rick said robust cash flow",pos,train
"Then the next thing that you want to look at carefully is you want to look at what we describe as first brand, which is essential the naive patient population and switchers",pos,train
"But I would expect VENCLEXTA will ramp based on the available population within that population will ramp within that fairly quickly, but then over time it will be the progression of those patients going forward that become available",pos,train
"We are forecasting R&D expense of roughly 16% of sales, which reflects an increase in funding to support our late-stage pipeline and continued progress across numerous mid-stage programs",pos,test
tax reform enables more efficient access to our foreign cash and the ability to deploy it in the United States,pos,test
And the reason why first-line is important is that’s the brand that gets the opportunity to put the patient into the highest level of control if that brand does not do that then obviously the patient rotates to something else,pos,train
"As we reflect on AbbVie’s performance as a Company and we evaluate our future prospects, we see a very strong company, well positioned for the future",pos,train
"Product such as LUPRON, Creon, and Duodopa continue to perform well in their categories, and we expect and continue to be very stable profitable products for many years to come",pos,train
"So I'll take most of those and may have Mike chime in on that, on the third one, the Rova-T one, but I will give you some color on that as well",pos,train
We continue to build on our strong momentum and we are well positioned to advance our strategic priorities,pos,test
So if you step back and if you look at what are the key parameters that you want to understand of the performance of HUMIRA and the longer-term performance of the brand and its ability to be able to continue to grow,pos,train
"Well quite frankly, if you add up the projects that we have announced and some of them are in the process like the big Yankuang project and so on, out of that $9 billion, about almost $4 billion of it is committed",pos,train
"We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and as we have said, expect on-stream in phases in early fiscal 2019",pos,train
"As I've always said, the degree of commitment and motivation of our people is the real sustainable competitive advantage that we have",pos,train
"In fact, being the most diverse will contribute to maintaining our position as the most profitable industrial gas company over the long term",pos,train
"First, the tremendous opportunity for Air Products to expand our well proven onsite business model to supply syngas, and we have some great recent examples",pos,train
We continue to make progress on the necessary approvals and hope we can close on this joint venture at some point during fiscal year '18,pos,train
"But coming out of that, we believe the underlying fundamentals remain positive and I know our team is working diligently to maintain pricing momentum",pos,test
And we are excited about the strong opportunities that we have to build on our success,pos,train
"And then going forward, if we're thinking out to 2019, 2020",pos,train
"And do you have any onsite business, any pools of assets that are below the take or pay threshold, such that volume growth does not translate into profit growth if this strength in the end market continues for the next couple of years",pos,train
"The center point about what Corning just said is that if you are building any kind of a facility to produce syngas, gasification is the process where the CO2 that you produce is what is called capture ready",pos,train
"We do remain very bullish about opportunities for industrial gases, our conventional business around the world",pos,train
"As I just mentioned, we view this capacity as available to enable projects and acquisitions",pos,train
"As you know, our portfolio actions and the strong cash flow generation of our company provides us with an expected capacity of over $9 billion to invest over the next three years",pos,train
"I truly believe that Air Products will be successful in utilizing our balance sheet, the best in the industry, to invest in our four industrial gases business to create significant value for our shareholders",pos,train
"We see great opportunities in mergers and acquisitions, asset buybacks and large new projects, as well as a significant amount of more typical industrial gas projects",pos,train
We have become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world,pos,train
Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment of our drivers to transport our products in all kinds of severe weather conditions to deliver product to our customers,pos,train
Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment from our operators and maintenance workers who day in and day out work hard to keep our plans running even during severe hurricanes and other challenging conditions to ensure reliable supply to our customers,pos,train
Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment of our sales people who work hard every day to develop and bring in new opportunities to Air Products by creating value for our customers,pos,train
"Clearly, it’s an area of opportunity though and we're quite focused on that",pos,train
"We remain committed to our goal of being the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world",pos,test
"We will continue to focus on safety, controlling our cost and investing in the many strategic growth opportunities that we see",pos,train
"We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation and an empowered and decentralized organization",pos,train
"Our great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented and motivated employees remain focused on being the safest and most profitable and diverse industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers",pos,train
We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to grow EPS by at least 10% every year,pos,test
"And finally, we continue to see great opportunities in the new industrial gas projects around the world",pos,test
"Notably, these include major contracts expanding our supply to two of Samsung’s major sites in Korea",pos,train
"We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units, to supply syngas to our customers based on long term contracts",pos,train
"Essentially, these opportunities is the same as our traditional onsite business model, something that we do every day, but with existing rather than new production assets",pos,train
"Again, we think investible cash flow is now the right metric as it represents the cash generated that we can choose how to deploy in order to create shareholder value",pos,train
"Can you just comment on any remaining supply side dynamics that would help maintain the momentum in fiscal year '18? Are there still additional facility closures, steel for instance? Or do you believe the comps will become more difficult as you progress throughout the year? And then just also any quick comments on regional demand trends if you have any by end market would be helpful? Thanks",pos,train
"Going forward, we would expect to replace the liquid oxygen and nitrogen more quickly than the liquid argon, which will advance in year-on-year sales comparison",pos,train
"And the third area of opportunity is very large industrial projects around the world, driven by demand for more energy, environmental requirements and energy market growth",pos,train
The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these opportunities can be,pos,train
Some of these new large projects that I am talking about can also include gasification and syngas supply,pos,train
So I think there're some do and some don't in China that we continue to progress the transformation of that market to be more of a traditional industrial gas environment,pos,train
"And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Shell's coal gasification technology supporting our syngas supply position and supporting our strategy in this area",pos,train
"But we have always said that out of what we think they have to divest, we don't have any inside knowledge on this thing",pos,train
"But out of what we think they have to invest, there will be an opportunity for us to compete in about $1 billion to $1",pos,train
"And obviously, when and if that thing comes into play, we will be interested in that for sure",pos,train
"But we are talking about here in the projects that we are pursuing is turning the coal, especially high sulfur coal into environmentally friendly way by gasifying it and producing chemicals",pos,train
"As I mentioned, yesterday we announced the largest dividend increase in Air Products’ history, continuing our commitment to retain cash to shareholders",pos,train
"Listen, on that one, if there's any project that we can go after, our number one priority is to spend our money in the United States, because of a lot of good reasons",pos,train
"So the fact that we are investing in other parts of the world, doesn't mean that we are not focused in the U",pos,train
"The issue is that there're not that many opportunities, right now; but we are absolutely focused on that; we need to push everyday on every single project; and I hope in time, we will announce some big ones in the U",pos,train
"Now please turn to slide number 25, where I want to point out once again that we believe our real competitive advantage is the motivated and committed people of Air Products",pos,train
"We then think of funding our growth capital, including acquisitions from our cash and balance sheet capacity, as well as from our investible cash flows",pos,train
"In terms of acquiring assets and plans for the so called asset buyback that we have been talking about, in December, we announced an ASU asset buyback on long term industrial gas supply agreements for Jinmei Huayu in China",pos,train
"And we recently signed and closed on another deal to acquire three existing large air suppression unit assets in China, and have began supplying customers and their long-term agreements",pos,train
I think what we're going to see is some new demand perhaps from furnaces that'll probably strengthen as we come into the coming year,pos,train
Now please turn to slide number nine to discuss the areas of opportunity for us to invest and move Air Products forward,pos,train
"First, acquisition of small and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets for businesses from other industrial gas companies",pos,train
"The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers, where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee under a long term contract",pos,train
We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three key metrics,pos,test
We remain focused on driving further improvements as we move forward,pos,train
"We remain very focused on growing earnings, growing cash flow, managing our forward leasing rollover risk which as George touched on, we have down into the single digits, maintaining and ever improving our balance sheet and creating a steady pipeline and evaluate opportunities",pos,test
"And look, it is a struggle and we talk to a number of investors that are, I don’t say, equally split, but there is clearly a recognition that there is sometimes the distinction between earnings momentum and value creating or value harvesting",pos,train
"Certainly, the platforms we have in all three of our key markets I think are attractive to them in terms of the location, the quality sponsorship, part of our inventory",pos,train
"Just some other quick notable highlights, focus remains on cash flow growth, capital allocation and a strong balance sheet",pos,test
"A number of prospects continue to show interest and we have no doubt the remaining space will lease up quickly in the hot Northwest domain market, which is increasingly known as Austin’s second downtown",pos,train
"We will be t here where we will be having a big family party, probably the latter, because I think I enjoyed the last year with my brothers and sons and daughters and so it’s an exciting time",pos,train
"So we think that some market in the location of the project that we started will continue to be better and we actually did see an opportunity to introduce a bit of a mixed use tower to that market, so it’s a differentiated product with a bit of a differentiated amenity package",pos,train
And we think that that will want to make a real point of difference for us as we stop the balance of the office space over the next couple of years and fill in the balance of the retail and the apartment leasing,pos,train
"So since we don’t really publish an NAV, having referenced t hose as relevant data points to our investors, so our approach on issuing those shares was to ensure that we met our balance sheet targets, absorb tremendous financial flexibility, the floors fund our development value add pipeline and that was a decision we made in the middle of December of last year",pos,train
The large suites vacated in 2017 continue to see good levels of activity and tours that picked up in the last two weeks,pos,test
"So to wrap it, 2017 resulted in the solid execution on the key pillars of our strategic plan, mainly growing earnings, growing cash flow, free funding our development and enhancing our balance sheet",pos,test
"The success of our investment and financing activity has demonstrated our discipline to continually improve our balance sheet, create a growth driven portfolio and free fund our development activities",pos,train
"But then we take a look at some of the non-core assets, I mean, as we look at the plan going forward, we would hope to identify access sale opportunities with some matched funding for either asset acquisitions or crating some value toward development pipeline",pos,train
"And that as we said through the last several years, they’ve certainly learned the lesson to make sure their balance sheet remains in exceedingly good shape going into whatever the cycles were",pos,train
"I think they continue to grow and need space and are in the building now, so we're kind of just playing that one by ear and that's a 1/1/19 event date",pos,test
"We continue to advance planning, predevelopment and zoning efforts on several other development sites, including 405 Colorado and downtown Austin, larger ranch in suburban Austin and a broaden more master plan in Northwest part of Austin, our Metroplex project here in Pennsylvania suburbs and Phase 1 of Schuylkill Yards",pos,train
"And then here in Philadelphia, I think the focus is primarily on our Metroplex project which had employment meeting, which is -- depending upon the configuration between two and 340,000 so we’re in active discussions with a number of prospects on that",pos,train
"So the price point we’re trying to achieve there is the upper end of the market, but we're getting good traction on that because of I think some companies recognizing the value of that location and also the quality of the work environment that they can create there",pos,train
"We've got a 48,000 square foot tenant down in Dulles Corner that we know is going to move out in the third quarter",pos,train
"Well, I think anybody looking at Schuylkill Yards a couple of years down the path, so we haven't really had any discussions with our existing tenant base for Schuylkill Yards, but we continue to get a number of inquiries from inside the city, outside the city, outside the region about that project and all of the elements that it brings to the table",pos,test
"So to conclude, we're delighted with the achievement to date on the business plan and with the activity levels in our markets to meet the balance of our 2018 objectives",pos,test
"In terms of our core markets and the underlying assumptions contained in our 2018 leasing plan, in CBD Philadelphia, during the fourth quarter, we renewed and expanded Comcast at Three Logan Square",pos,train
"I think as we look at going forward, we would be looking at any equity issuance tied to an investment opportunity that would create value for our company",pos,train
"I think going forward, we’re going to be very focused on where that currency can create value for our shareholders on a going forward basis",pos,train
"So I do think that, as we said on previous calls, we think a lot of the heavylifting is behind us in terms of portfolio repositioning, but I do think it’s incumbent upon us, all should be very mindful of where we think these markets are going and so always staying in close touch with capital sources in the investment market to make sure that we are in a position to respond as we see opportunities come up",pos,train
"And then on Schuylkill Yards, we continue to work with our partners, Gotham on the residential side and Longfellow on the life science side along with our Brandywine team to really think through the various components of our Phase 1 development, which we still currently contemplate will be in office on life science building, but we’re also evaluating expansion of a retail phase there as well as the incorporation of potentially some residential",pos,train
"It was a challenging decision for us, but frankly given the sector’s equity market volatility, interest rate headwinds, we opted to issue the shares to ensure continuation of our balance sheet targets and also to ensure forward funding capacity",pos,train
"And finally, to further improve our funding capacity, financial flexibility and improve our balance sheet, we did utilize our ATM program, which has been in place since 2013 and sold $51 million of stock at an average price of $18",pos,train
"And we also think that kind of in these uncertain times, it does make sense to make sure that we're really bulletproofed on the right side of the balance sheet",pos,train
"With that general theme, we do take a look at the office, the office markets continue to be in a state of disruption across the board, whether the impact of technology, product coming online and we do recognize that the markets and submarkets are ever changing and we really need to be mindful of where we think each of those markets will be in the next five to ten years and frankly where our product will be positioned in those markets",pos,train
I don’t know if there is going to be substantial growth over the next 12 months,pos,train
"But I do think, as we look going forward, we are going to be very focused on continuing to monetize our land holdings, which we've had great success over the last couple of years",pos,train
"That we are going to continue, as we’ve laid out in our full year business plan, try and reduce our exposure to some of these joint ventures and we're able to do a couple of good transactions, the latter part of ’17 with a partial sale of DRA, the swappings of the property interest with our Conshohocken venture to accept that as well as on the Allstate side, sell out of the property",pos,test
"So we always want to maintain earnings momentum and we do acknowledge that this asset churning does create a sense of frustration by some investors, but honestly from, I think as a shareholder perspective, I don't think we’d want to be in a position where we're afraid to trade all FFO value creation and harvesting",pos,train
"So I think our approach going forward is, I think, we will remain opportunistic",pos,train
"After some test marketing, we’re able to really identify international global investment fund based in Southeast Asia, we were able to see the long term value in owning that property",pos,train
"So they made their first entrance into the Philadelphia investment market, which we think is a great result for our portfolio with some great read through, so the two sales that we've done at Cira Center south have both been the foreign investors which we think really starts to validate the investment thesis in Philadelphia that we’re trying to create",pos,train
"Our business plan targets remain unchanged from our last call, but a point to elaborate on a same store NOI growth",pos,train
"So I mean, while we're finalizing the approvals, we're spending a lot of time pre-marketing that project and we certainly view that as something we want to start as soon as we sign up the tenant",pos,train
"So we’re starting to play any process down a couple of individual buildings there that we think will be well received, but that's probably -- in terms of delivery a ’19 event",pos,train
And we will continue to pursue the right balance between efficiency and investing in our franchise and opportunistically building our fee revenue streams,pos,train
Just on the loan just following up on Sean on a loan discussion and can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of loan pricing and just a competitive landscape as it relates to just yes structures and pricing?,pos,train
"So as Jamie said, we expect to deliver a double digit increase in core EPS quarter-over-quarter, which would be a 16% to 18% improvement over the first quarter of last year",pos,test
"So when there are opportunities in the market we'll double down a little bit with investment, with marketing and maybe with some new hires",pos,train
And I guess that's based off of the forward curve that we are looking at here so based on a couple of rate hikes in 2018,pos,test
"And I know you said you expect credit to remain relatively stable given the trends you are seeing here, but just wanted to touch on the provision and what might be a good run rate moving forward?",pos,train
"Payrolls go up especially if we get into any big infrastructure spend that the financial type job they don’t have nearly as many workers comp claims, but we if get into a big construction boom here in the U",pos,train
"You know I haven't really looked at the math but when it comes to the interest non-deductibility matter but again to be honest if somebody is interested in selling to a PE firm they're probably not interested in adding capabilities to our resources they just want to be a part of a friend [ph], of a label",pos,train
"Not all these acquisition transactions will close, but I feel good about our ability to attract acquisition partners in our typical small tuck-in size at fair prices",pos,train
And we're of course doing all we can to utilize technology to continue improve our business,pos,train
And then any restrictions on private equity leveraging up with tax reforms is that going to make a difference?,pos,test
We have some pretty exciting things going on in terms of helping us improve our service to the customers when it comes to distribution RPS on the wholesale side is the place that's putting good wholesaler to broker type capability then it will allow them to quick quote cyber umbrella etcetera,pos,train
When it comes to exposures; we are seeing some better signs of exposure growth in the recent couple of quarters,pos,train
"As I do each quarter, today I'm going to touch on the four key components of our strategy to drive shareholder value",pos,train
"Looking forward, I think 2018 brokerage organic will be similar to 2017 perhaps even a little better if PC pricing and exposures continue to improve",pos,train
"We set a companywide goal of 90,000 hours of curable work over the next 12 months",pos,train
"But I think that the reality of this as this gets to be much more of a complicated business especially take our benefits practices we just talked about, it is very confusing and we have some really, really great smaller brokers out there that when they join us, they continue to grow great service to their customers when they throw in our capabilities",pos,train
"Now the other thing that's driving it is we're making sure that our clients realize that we’re not just about health instance, what we are doing is trying to help employers become the destination employer and in this work environment we are approaching full employment that's important stuff",pos,train
"So our voluntary numbers are up, our consulting numbers and HR are up, our health insurance numbers are up nicely but it really is across the board",pos,train
"When you look at it longer-term here is how we think about it, because we have nearly $700 million of tax credits on our balance sheet and because we believe we can generate about $225 million of credits annually in 2018 and 2019 and then about $180 million of credit annually in 2020 and 2021, it looks on a global basis, our net cash taxes paid will be about 1% of our EBITDAC for the next three of four years since starting in 2011 or 2022 globally we will be paying taxes of about 7% to 10% of our EBITDAC through the late 2020",pos,train
"Sometimes prices come out strong but customers have the ability to opt out of price not so they have the ability to take deductibles up, buy less cover on the top end, so they will control their annual spend on insurance and we talk about opting in and opting out all the time",pos,train
"So, we will probably get a good idea of after the second quarter if there is more of an increase in some of that properties; is that right?",pos,train
"Second, I have always said that be careful, as you digest in your thinking, when looking at EPS, when it comes to clean energy, it is not a core business but rather an investment that generates some cash that can be reinvested into our core operation",pos,train
"And we run the business according to a core set of tenants which are focused on teamwork, ethics, outstanding client service, and a dedication to the communities we operate in",pos,train
With our strong cash flows we should be able to fund M&A with free cash and debt coming to 2018 as well as the bump up in our dividend that we announced yesterday,pos,train
So I think that's something that we'll continue to do is focus on that number,pos,train
"I think, I said in my open commentary that we hope to have that here by late March or early April, so",pos,train
"The nature of our wholesale business in there is moving business into the London marketplace, it's not nearly as big when you look at side cars and programs and that",pos,train
"So there is a lot of different dependencies when it comes to product sales and how that actually impacts our current quarter revenue but overtime what we expect is that we'll continue to grow our customer base, we'll continue to sell into our existing customer base",pos,train
"Led by Don DeMarinis and the increased energy level, passion and drive he starting instilling in our sales teams; and Rob Jacks, whose increased commitment to customer service is being seen and felt by our customers and backed up by an expanding technical talent base who are driving our products and technical services forward with increasing momentum every passing week I'm confident we will be able to grow consistently and profitably in the future",pos,test
"Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement; cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, was $37",pos,train
While continuing to be increasingly successful in the food service management vertical we have now expanded the reach of rGuest Buy to the casino market segment as well,pos,train
"We've installed rGuest Buy in a few pilot and production sites at large casinos in North America showcasing the capability of the product to move upstream into larger, more complicated installations which naturally come with more functionality and interphase demands",pos,train
Going forward our Asia Pacific and EMEA Managing Director and our Global Marketing Head will continue to report directly to me,pos,train
"We are enthusiastic about the progress we've made towards transforming Agilysys into a more customer centric partner, a company big enough to be a stable partner to even the largest hospitality enterprise but nimble and agile enough to respond to their needs quickly",pos,train
"And with a healthy balance sheet that includes nearly $40 million in cash and no debt, we are well positioned to achieve sustained profitability",pos,test
"In two ways Allen, number one, currently our large big hotel chains are mostly focused on the InfoGenesis product; so we have an opportunity there to introduce our other products to them which we are in the process off",pos,train
"But even before that our current implementations of InfoGenesis where we are replacing competitor systems in those hotel chains, our initial implementations have gone well and as they continue to go well it becomes easier and easier to convince the other ownership and the other hotels in that chain which are beginning to pick up our product one by one and that pace has definitely has picked up in the last three/four months because our initial implementations have gone quite well and now we expect that pace to pick up in international regions as well",pos,train
"Number one, he'll bring a lot more energy to our sales activities because I think one of the aspects of revenue growth for us, he is just driving sales with a more passion and energy and making sure that we are uncovering all the opportunities and paying complete attention to it and he obviously has a terrific track record of success in Micros [ph], highly respectable company that really did well, that grew from our kind of size to a $1 billion company and Don was part of that group",pos,train
"And also he is a very good team player, very cohesive and he will build great relationships internally with our product development, product management services teams; so he makes our team more cohesive and he brings a lot more energy to the sales team and he arguably is the most knowledgeable person in this area now in our management team as well",pos,test
as well as we make progress on converting ourselves into a software technology powerhouse in the hospitality industry,pos,train
"When required, a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP can be found in today's press release, as well as in the Company's website",pos,train
"We are pleased with this growth in our SaaS-based recurring revenue and as we continue to expand our customer base, our recurring revenue will continue to grow both, the SaaS revenue and the recurring license maintenance revenue",pos,train
So it's a matter of really growing our customer base and penetrating our existing customer base even more and as we grow our customer base [indiscernible],pos,train
So in the Americas we have to grow the opportunities and pay more focused attention on each of our sales opportunities in the U,pos,test
"We are just about getting some of our product gaps fixed in order to get going in Canada, so that's going to be a major area of growth for us and we have opportunities to get started in the Latin American region as well",pos,train
"So those are pretty big tasks that we need undivided attention on which is what Don is going to be focused on, and while he does that I'm going to be spending relatively more time focusing on Europe and Asia and making sure that we push that forward so that our revenue growth possibility there are also driven forward",pos,train
"Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipate, intend, plan, goal, believe, estimate, expect, future, likely, may, should, will and other similar references to future periods",pos,train
"Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control",pos,train
"In closing, we remain encouraged about the opportunities ahead of us to further leverage our existing customer base, engage with new customers and enter new markets",pos,train
"We are getting close Allen, the business momentum that we have now, the number of sales and other discussions we are having with customers; that momentum translating itself into revenue growth, we feel that we are quite close and then we can sustain it quite well in the future as well",pos,train
"There are many product aspects here in the process of improving that will give both customers a reason to buy from us and they want to buy more from us because like -- one major customer told us they want to reduce the number of small vendor we are dealing with, it is just us getting a few more of the product innovation aspects done",pos,train
We are setting ourselves up well to drive home the opportunities before us,pos,train
"Since we have such a large NOL carry forward and the one that we have today doesn't expire until 2031, they start to expire in our fiscal 2031",pos,train
So if we turn profitable we'll have years of benefit from that NOL carry forward,pos,train
We have enormous opportunities in international regions and in each of those regions there are a couple of more product gaps that have to be filled in order for us to really make a difference in Asia and EMEA and we are well on our way towards doing that,pos,train
"We have opportunities in FSM, in food service management, for which again there are a few more things we have to get done in InfoGenesis and our rGuest Buy before those opportunities kick-in",pos,train
"We are well on our way towards becoming a more energetic, more customer centric and generally a more passionate and innovative engineering driven company",pos,train
We continue to believe this business has massive opportunities to create substantial shareholder value,pos,train
"We are definitely working on a bigger pipeline and more opportunities now globally, not just in the U",pos,train
"Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial conditions to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements today include, among others, our ability to achieve operational efficiencies and meet customer demand for products and solutions and the risks described in today's news announcement and in the Company's filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, including the company's reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q",pos,train
"In Q3, we continue to expand sales and marketing efforts in the markets that presented long-term growth opportunities",pos,train
"In addition, excluding a small number of installations in Banfield clinics, we placed 343 hematology instruments in North America compared to 288 last year",pos,test
"I think it will stay in mix for a while, because the smaller factors really can’t really effort to put full clinics in but they are very successful with the mobile clinics and the routine vets clinics",pos,train
"Also we will continue to support the i-STAT for the long-term, but moving forward we will focus on new sales on this new and improved Alinity analyzer",pos,train
I can also record that we are now including the fuse collectively platform with all VetScan sales and our diagnostic specialist team is beginning to place fuse units into existing customer sites,pos,train
"While our sales team hunts and finds prospective customers for capital equipment, we believe these strategic moves are more effective and will help both parties grow faster",pos,train
We are confident this rotor growth is representative of a very healthy North American Piccolo business driven by the successful launch of Abbott’s new sales and marketing programs,pos,train
"Important thing is forward once we get beyond March, we should be in that 24% to 26% range",pos,train
"Like I mentioned in the last call, we continue to spend more in FY’2018 on R&D to complete our new products and more in sales and marketing as we expand our field team",pos,test
"Yes, so the big task for Abaxis this next quarter to work with our factory folks to scale up the FLEX4 and also working with our vendor on the urine sediment machine to make sure that they have the capacity to supply the number of units that we believe that we can sell in Q4",pos,train
And so while that expectation is dependent on the factory and all the other things that have to take place the team here is very confident that we can do it,pos,train
"So those three things, okay, will allow us to continue to add new customers and to maintain our existing ones",pos,train
"That team were growing by about 10% and reducing their field area a little bit, so they can be little more effective at just selling equipment and ultimately being responsible for their customer base",pos,train
That’s the major expansions in our additional group of diagnostic specialists and that what we’re trying to ramp up pretty quickly,pos,train
"These types of services not only will take our customer care to the next level, but can also quickly identify analyzers additional analyzers and consumable opportunities within the customer base",pos,train
This improvement will expand our available market for the feline panel and will allow us to target many of our current customers not using that panel today,pos,train
"And we expect probably within the next nine months maybe 12 months -- it depends – this is a science project, that will have a new instrument and we’ll have rotors that have both chemistry and TSH on them",pos,train
"So I think that some of the factor you see, I mean, because the differential is so small between minus one or plus three is not – is unnecessarily we’re falling out every quarter, but I think the end customer demand is now little bit better than what should be a GAAP number",pos,train
"And we also have a large number of customers that might run the competitive 4 FLEX, put by our single to just run recheck to respond to therapy testing",pos,train
And we will begin selling the FLEX4 when we're sure we have the inventory levels to where we want them that we go on take backward,pos,train
This is the next generation of our i-STAT instrument while Alinity will run most of the current i-STAT one cartridge menu that will now be capable of adding many new test down the road which we know will add significant value to the product portfolio,pos,train
"So FUSE it’s a huge piece, everything we do going forward has to connect in the FUSE, everything has to work with FUSE, but most importantly that it will needs a better customer retention and with that better retention our sales go up, right, because we’re growing customer base instead of staying flat",pos,train
We continue to make investments and improvements in our international sales and marketing infrastructure,pos,train
"We constantly train our sales staff, re-engineering our sales and marketing teams until all gaps and territories in order to deliver the best products and services to our international customers we continue to believe our growth in international markets should continue to improve over the next several years",pos,train
"And the second one and this might be for you, Clint or Don, but you know a big increase in the reps where you talk to a little bit over a hundred today to go into 150 in three months, can you do that while limiting the disruption of the organization is to recut territories, maybe just the thoughts of what needs to get done internally to increase the rep count by in around 30%? Thanks guys",pos,train
In fact – running the team is a little bit overwhelmed which resonates and I know our HR department is overwhelmed as well,pos,train
And our goal continues to be to grow our Piccolo business at a double-digit pace over the long-term,pos,train
"But this is a major, major project and we’re spending as we need to spend",pos,train
"And then, there is other support folks in the field that we’ve got our professional services reps and all the managers that work with them and our distributor managers travel on the field and I’m not even counting those numbers we gave you",pos,train
In addition most regional account managers with smaller territories will provide more consistent sales opportunities and better area coverage as well as improving working relationships with our distributors,pos,train
And so we are really sure that our productivity will more than pay for this team and distribution will actually more money through the addition product sales,pos,train
"And Don, I think there is some legacy accounts like that, but I do think that what -- on the retail side of this, the bank we are trying to be more market priced on new relationships coming in versus being below the market in certain situations, it's always hard to bring that back up",pos,train
"Someday we might turn on that, but right now as Dave said, we’re going to build up the salesforce",pos,train
"If we really found somebody that's terrific and have an opportunity to hire somebody, we will probably make some room in the stable for that person",pos,train
"We need to build upon our 34 years of excellent reputation, expanding the existing relationships and bringing new relationships to the bank",pos,train
And so we are actively with the opportunities we see in that in the coastal market,pos,test
"And so, I guess, -- my intention would be to keep you apprised as we go quarterly and I think the first couple of quarters will probably be a little slow",pos,train
"So initially, I guess, taking what you say the conversation probably is going to center really around the hiring itself and as far as the traction that's gained, that’s down the road maybe, I don’t know, if second half or third -- fourth quarter something you guys will start talking about",pos,test
"We also have a small $6,000 consumer loan that is paying as agreed",pos,train
"One of those is a chronic delinquent, down -- the balance is down $1,000, so that’s kind of big one there",pos,train
American River Bank will continue to be focused -- be a focused business bank in Northern California,pos,train
"We have an excellent opportunity to grow based on the markets we serve, and we will be hiring some new marketing focused relationship managers in the next few months which will help us grow our business",pos,train
"I discussed this a little bit further in the press release -- again they’re in the process of reorganization, we’re going to continue to monitor very closely by gathering information as it becomes available",pos,train
"If necessary we will make additional adjustments in the future, which may include additional write-downs",pos,train
We remain committed to funding the majority of our organic loan growth with core deposits,pos,train
Our anticipation is that as perhaps another couple of Fed actions take place we'll start to see that build a little more,pos,train
We expect to continue to deploy capital through our stated priorities,pos,train
"With rising rates, we would expect the residential mortgage business to continue to moderate",pos,train
One of the really great benefits of this because of Bank Mutual sitting inside of our footprint and as we consolidate these branches we are going to create an increasing number of large branches which of course become more efficient,pos,train
So the combination of going into the start of it what appears to be a really benign credit environment will probably dictate that the provision will be driven much by loan growth as well as perhaps the unexpected that might pop-up,pos,train
"With regard to the mix, we continue to see a mix out of pure DDA and into interest bearing on the consumer side out of DDA and money market and in that time we'll probably continue to see a little of that shift",pos,train
"So, we will be open minded as we move through the year as we think about other opportunities",pos,train
"Following the announced acquisition of Bank Mutual, the company began to moderate its commercial real estate loan growth as we expect to add over a $1 dollars of commercial real estate assets from Bank Mutual shortly",pos,train
There are still a number of open implementation and accounting matters that will require clarification as such we may refine our estimates in future periods,pos,train
We continue to optimize our funding mix and as I said shifted some of our network transaction deposits to time deposits over this past six months,pos,train
"And then, number two, how long would that dynamic be expected to continue or is it transitory or something that that goes on for another quarter or two?",pos,train
During 2017 we saw credit metrics improve across the portfolio with a noticeable improvement in oil and gas loans,pos,train
And we would expect to see that continue on a buoyant path provided market conditions remain positive,pos,test
As I mentioned we have a significant conversion of our online and mobile platforms which will occur in the coming couple of months,pos,train
"I just want to go back to the third quarter call, and I know as we move forward in the integration, you guys are going to talk more and more just about the Alaskan network",pos,train
"While we focused on expanding our network in 2017, our growth will stabilize in 2018 and we expect it to slow to about 4% in 2019 and 2020, as we take advantage of the substantial growth of the last few years and optimize and refine our network",pos,train
"And I will also tell you just to say it now that the up sell and segmentation opportunity that we are looking at, that is not in the synergy numbers, and we think that's a $100-plus million a year or more once we get that up and running",pos,train
"The opportunities that will begin to materialize post-PSS include the following: first, all but one of our international partners that serve California, that's approximately 50 wide-body departures a day, will gain full access to the acquired network from Virgin America, including the nine new markets we started with Airbus metal over the past six months",pos,train
"So one of the things we are doing is making sure that every 23,000 of us at Alaska, Horizon Air Group are living our purpose in both",pos,train
"We received a single operating certificate from the FAA, a Herculean effort that allows us to operate Alaska and Virgin America as one airline and which is also a prerequisite for other merger-related activities like the PSS cutover",pos,train
And that will start then and continue to grow as we move through the year,pos,train
"Your point is right, it is real, and it's one of the opportunities that we see as move into second half of 2018 and 2019 to really improve the financial performance of our business",pos,train
And it allows us to move capacity around in Sea-Tac for other markets that we want to put metal in because it's getting constrained,pos,train
And it is my firm believe that the competitive landscape we face today will do just that again,pos,test
"We've been looking at our delivery skyline across all fleet types and plan to take advantage of the substantial 18% growth that we've had in the last two years, and refine, and as Brad said, optimize our network accordingly",pos,train
"We are very optimistic about Horizon's future, as we're consolidating our headquarters in Seattle, as we're building better career pathways between the two companies for front-line employees starting with pilots",pos,train
One of the strategies we have in place right now is to operate the best we can in California,pos,train
"We continue to believe that revenue potential of the new Alaska network is substantial, that we expect synergies to reach $200 million in 2019",pos,train
"We believe that overtime, conditions will improve and our ability to compete will get better, which I'm going to discuss in detail shortly",pos,train
"We have long term plan, and quite frankly when we looked out, if you take the fuel of this last year, the capacity and the economic environment, there were markets that we wanted to continue to invest in, really not new markets but add to some of the core",pos,train
"If we go back a year in time, I think a lot of investors were benchmarking profitability at that time saying, okay, put a pilot deal and some headwinds in 2018",pos,train
"And there are specific costs in - that we will incur that even, frankly, don't get quoted as integration costs that will be in our business through PSS, certainly perhaps through the first half of the year, and those are extra time in our call centers, and extra time in the operations as we kind of put all this stuff together",pos,train
"I don't think, we know exactly where the 4% of 2019 or 2020 are going to go, but I think our thinking is that we want to take care of our core",pos,train
"We're going to sort of bolster those and invest in those, and then we'll see what opportunities happen beyond there",pos,train
But I think we will pay attention to the core first is what I'm trying to say,pos,test
What I can say is where we are now is not a place we want to be and we're looking to improve the results going forward,pos,train
"Yeah, stability, in fact, we're hoping for stability trends as we move into Q2, but really into the back half of the year, where, given all things were equal today, we feel like there should be stability northward trends in our unit revenues going forward, especially if some of the things that we shared earlier start to kick-in",pos,test
"And then, the second part of that question was just, in terms of RASM, do you have a general goal as far as where you want to go? And like Southwest talks about maintaining positive RASM going forward, is that something that you're looking to get to? Or are you approaching it in a different way?",pos,train
"Our first reconfigured Airbus will enter service in September, and the additional seats, we will gain will not only reduce Airbus fleet CASM and Airbus represents approximately 25% of our mainline fleet, it will result in meaningful increase in First Class seats and the introduction of Premium Class on these aircraft",pos,train
This will drive both incremental revenues and the ability for our Elites to obtain better access to upgrades,pos,train
"So when looking forward, when you guys are talking about the synergies in the deal, should we be thinking the level of profitability that we're modeling this year is the right basis from which to now be adding the deal synergies? Or should we be thinking, hey, what was attainable a year ago, given a little bit of time and ability to catch up on fuel, we should be back to that level of profitability?",pos,train
"For now, I'll share that there are clear opportunities which we will seize to improve our control over cost structure",pos,test
We continue to aggressively execute on our strategy of adding meaningful assets and bringing medical innovation to patients worldwide,pos,test
"And so, with that the prevalence of this disease will continue to expand ongoing year-after-year which is why we feel very good about our current revenue estimate for JCAR017",pos,train
"We will continue to aggressively invest in research and development and to deploy capital to acquire or license the most promising science, technology, and products",pos,train
"As Mark discussed, we made numerous strategic investments for the next decade, all while balancing our deployment of capital to opportunistically benefit from market volatility in the fourth quarter by strong share repurchase actions",pos,train
"Having said that, we will have the ability to include the data within the label and differentiate this with the competition",pos,train
And so we do expect the momentum will continue and we do expect to have that kind of an inflection outside of the U,pos,train
"Additional pipeline assets will enter into pivotal programs this year such as BGB-A317, marizomib, luspatercept and CC-122",pos,test
"The addition of fedratinib to our portfolio will allow us to build a leadership position in myelofibrosis, and we’re actively preparing for a midyear FDA submission",pos,train
"And so we will protect it, we will build around it as we need to and are required to, but we see that as a standalone dynamic very critical program for our future",pos,test
"Throughout the year, we continue to use our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in new collaborations, while we repurchased approximately $4 billion of Celgene shares in line with our plans for 2017",pos,train
"Clearly, while they -- may well be revenue contribution that’s additive from the Juno partnership in 2020, we haven't updated our targets yet, because there's still basically what we’re shooting for, but clearly the Juno and the whole cellular immunotherapy space is all about after 2020 and I think that's really what we'd encourage you to think about is just what kind of potential this technology and these assets across the board can contribute when you get out to the mid-part of the next decade and we're very excited about developing that we see as Mark and Nadim have said, enormous breakthroughs in the science and what the potential is for a treatment of patients",pos,train
With Ozanimod we are planning to secure FDA approval in RMS by year-end and to submit international registration dossiers in 2018 starting with Europe in Q1,pos,train
"As we move into 2018, we are preparing to submit the NDA for fedratinib in myelofibrosis by midyear",pos,test
Our pending acquisition of Juno Therapeutics and strong ongoing collaboration with bluebird on bb2121 will help Celgene become the preeminent cellular immunotherapy company,pos,train
"Sometimes people ask us, have you done enough and our answer would be, our focus is on the science as science continues to evolve, as good work comes along, we're going to keep going after it, because it's not like we have like a decision that oh, we’ve done enough BD [ph] and that we're done",pos,train
Our 2017 accomplishments and momentum continue to build on our core strengths to drive long-term value creation,pos,train
JCAR017 is an anchor asset which would allow us to establish a global leadership position in lymphoma with a potential best-in-class profile,pos,train
"In addition to the DTC work that we’re doing, we’re also focusing on in-office promotion as well as significant engagement with the KOL, both in the U",pos,train
"What we really need to do is make sure where as I said earlier on the front here on science, on the really innovations that are coming in the areas of science that we work and that can really make a difference in the whole next decade",pos,train
So the next thing we do will be really based on the science and the opportunity and the potential for it to make a big difference on our long-range plan,pos,train
"That was a large activity, but our stock was really in a different spot during the fourth quarter, so we saw it as a great opportunity",pos,train
"But, in general, I think that we feel like it makes a lot of sense, we run return on invested capital analyses and it's been a fantastic investment in a great way to return cash to shareholders for the company and certainly has been a major contributor to our return on invested capital as a Corporation",pos,train
"So we will continue -- expect to continue to do that as we go forward, but always as we said our first priority is strategic pipeline next-generation",pos,test
And then our second priority is just make sure we do have a strong financial capacity to return cash to shareholders in the most advantaged way possible,pos,train
"It's a partial year impact, so we have to know exactly when we close and then we will evaluate the financing based on how the debt markets appear and we can do less or more debt",pos,train
"We're very excited to build up the momentum from the inline products in Q4, execute against the late stage pipeline programs and continue to be aggressively looking for opportunities to add transformational assets to our growing portfolio",pos,train
Additional cellular therapy assets are currently in early phase trials for solid tumors and will complement Celgene's existing pipeline of next generation immuno-oncology molecules,pos,train
And then also we really see ourselves as a immunology expert company for obvious reasons and as you’re aware neuro inflammation is a key cause of neurodegenerative disease and we’re in the process of evaluating approaches for that angle of therapy as well,pos,train
"So if you look at our current situation, at our current target credit rating with our growing EBITDA, and then the benefit of tax reform with the ongoing access to offshore cash, we will maintain significant financial flexibility and potential leverage if we needed as well as the cash flow post closing the Juno acquisition",pos,train
"So we really remain in a great place to be able to take advantage of opportunities to make investments -- external investments that can help us grow beyond 2020, and at the same time still maintain share repurchase program consistent with our historic practice",pos,train
So what you saw was some levering up at the end of the year where we expanded our investment portfolio and the fastest assets that we want and like to hold and that as we've close the mergers we will begin to divest some of the assets that we are in on their balance sheets so by the end of the first quarter I think you will see us back to really just put the one plus one plus one and take out the extra leverage that we put on it in the end of the year that should be going by the end of the first quarter,pos,train
"Looking forward, we will continue to focus on growing our core relationship deposits across our entire footprint",pos,train
"When you look at both of those banks on a standalone basis, you’ve got to give a lot of credit to Kevin [indiscernible] and his management of the and Louisiana, the bank was larger, more efficient, more profitable, healthier in almost any measure you want to look at from, when we closed in January of 18th then it was in January of 14th and the exact same thing that can be said about our friends in Texas Don, Gary, Andy, Richard the team in Texas the bank was stronger, bigger more profitable, more efficient",pos,train
"So, all of those things play forward and help us as a combined entity to be more efficient and more profitable",pos,train
"When you look at the ability to harvest synergies out of the mergers, I think we still feel like they’re still opportunity there for us and our 20% number is going to hold today",pos,train
We continue -- we've been investment for the last several years in technology so I don’t know that we change our focus on that probably we are already there,pos,train
"So, I’ve said for some time that the buyer doesn’t get to set the timeline for bank mergers, the sellers does and so we want to be prepared and ready when opportunities are presented to us",pos,train
It's been a long path to the closing of this deals we are excited about the value this two great banks add to our company more importantly we are pleased to be able to finally execute on our strategic plan,pos,train
We believe the economy in 2018 will allow us to grow and expect mid-to-high-single-digit growth in the loans and deposits,pos,train
"Clearly on the mortgage side that drops to the bottom line there is production there, the insurance side, Marco [Indiscernible] runs our insurance team and does a fantastic job there he is a good leader and I know he is out actively looking for people on the insurance side",pos,test
I think that continued to play through the year for us but yes as the economy expands there is going to be opportunity I don’t again you probably a lot more than I do but I see a lot folks talking that loan growth late in the year just wasn’t there for the economy as a whole I think were a piece of that we cover eight states across the south and I think we're dealing the same pressures that lots of others are but when you look forward there is economic tailwinds I guess that can help us in 2018,pos,train
But you are making more money and you’re creating more capital,pos,train
"May have been pick at our last, impacted our last half growth for pipelines indicate, we are competing for deals all across the footprint and we remain confident and our ability to grow loans",pos,train
"8%, while this level is still unacceptable to our team we are obviously on the glad path toward more peer like efficiency and we expect 2018 to reflect the continued improvement",pos,train
Our board has authorized us to repurchase up to 6 million shares over the next two years and I would expect our team to execute this program opportunistically,pos,train
"And so, as we see opportunities we’re going to jump in the market",pos,train
"Finally, we continue our efforts to manage and deploy capital in the best interest of our shareholders",pos,train
"Yes, I think there is optimism out there I think our teams are playing every day and we can make excuses about what happened in '17 but we've got a lot of confidence in the team we've got out on the field and we're confident that we can play in the market and I think when you look at all of the things that are out there today to benefit from the growing economy, the shrinking unemployment, there is opportunity for us there is growth out there and we believe that our footprint that we can harvest that",pos,train
"Yes, so what we did there we were kind of preplanning so as we came in to the end of the year we were looking at their securities portfolio and our securities portfolio, looking at the type of assets that are coming forward from the two banks that were coming onboard with us and we made the corporate decision to pre-purchase or invest some of what we wanted to invest up of their side",pos,test
I think the door is open for us to continue to look for other opportunities,pos,train
"And as we look into 2018, we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to talk to some people that may want to join our team",pos,test
"As I mentioned earlier, we continue to be very disciplined and challenging our team on where we are spending money",pos,train
"our ability to continue to reduce our operating expenses, maintain strong credit quality and grow our balance sheet resulted in record earnings for our company in 2017, which is the same simple story that we’ve been sharing for several years now but it continues to result and improve performance year-after-year",pos,train
"We’re not going to give any details as to exactly when we would use that, but our priorities as I outlined in the call, I think remain consistent with our strategy in terms of the credit rating, funding our business and then using it to grow",pos,train
"So not each segment, I think what Amy was saying there at the company level way it works out we expect to be in the range, but not every segment will be there",pos,train
I couldn’t be more proud of what our team accomplished in 2017 and I’m looking forward to the opportunities ahead,pos,test
"So I’d said, we’ve seen an improvement and it is broadening out as well geographically as I mentioned earlier",pos,train
Is that range in revenue or is it range of profitability or an inability to get the supply chain fixed,pos,train
Again consistent what we talked about it at investor day we’re moving away from providing sales forecast and we try to grow the company profitably over the long haul,pos,train
They need to make some big structural or capacity changes or is it just adding shifts or what has to be worked out there?,pos,train
"In 2018, we expect to make additional investments in the expanded offerings and services that are important for Caterpillar’s long term success and we’ll use their operating and execution model to bias resources to areas that represent the greatest opportunity for return on our investments",pos,test
"Well, it is really – again, this is long-term game so we’re focus on long-term profitable growth and as you heard us talk about before really comes down to us having a more detailed granular understanding of byproduct, by application, by market where we get the best return on invested capital and we’re biasing our resources to those areas that represent the best opportunity for future profitable growth where we’ll get the best returns",pos,train
"And so, I think difficult for you to see – for us to predict in 2018, which you’ll see it’s a long-term game, but again their focus on services as I mentioned is very important and we’re invest in but it is up against the long haul",pos,train
"tax reform is positive for Caterpillar over the long-term, and then it provides a more competitive environment for us, both domestically and around the world by creating a more level playing field against our non-U",pos,train
The reform also provides greater flexibility to access our cash in order to deliver on our capital allocation priorities,pos,train
"In addition to China, we expect most other countries in Asia-Pacific to grow, largely driven by investments in infrastructure",pos,train
"North America sales were in 2017 and we expect them to be up again in 2018, so we’re at – were healthy sales levels, where exactly that is in the cycle and if we’re going to pull from trying to predict that",pos,train
"So the mix issue between parts in OE, so as OE starts to improve that can have a mix impact and there are certainly impact among different products within OE",pos,train
"So as pipelines are getting build out in support of the oil and gas activity and there’s been a lot of pipelines approved in the last year, that’s certainly a key areas of growth as well and an area where we’ve seen really good business",pos,train
"We also plan to profitably grow the company by investing in expanded offerings and services, the two additional major focus areas in our strategy",pos,train
"They do continue to ramp supply up to meet demand, and they are focused on getting every shipment to a customer order, and making sure that the customer demands are being met",pos,train
This is our first major excavator redesign in 25 years and just one example of our focus on expanded offerings to provide a range of products to better serve the diverse needs of our customers,pos,test
"In addition, we believe most miners have returned to profitability and we expect their capital spending to increase in 2018, with the growing share spent on sustaining capital expenditures",pos,train
"Despite these challenges, we remain focused on getting product to customers quickly, but also efficiently executing on the lean principles that we are continuing to implement across our factories",pos,train
"We’re really trying to focus on the long term here, and we are focused on improving margins overtime to achieve our long-term profitable growth objectives",pos,train
"We also want to grow the business, and so we’ll be investing to grow the business while staying within those ranges",pos,train
So we will continue in the month when there is not a nine and of the quarterly release we are going to move the release of retail staffs from before the market opens until after the market opens the day before the release,pos,test
"However, we know the market can change quickly, so while we are working in our factory and with our suppliers to support higher production levels across a number of products we also remain committed to a flexible and competitive cost structure that can respond quickly if demand changes",pos,train
"Clearly the biggest driver in profit growth is sales volume and so that’s going to have the biggest impact on the sales range, and so your sales assumption will drive you – is a key component of driving you to different parts of that range, there’s also lots of other variables around cost, price, material cost that could push you a different part in the range as well, but the volume is clearly the most significant driver of growth",pos,train
"But there certainly the need and there certainly the funding out there to fund infrastructure growth, another areas of strength in construction industries as pipeline build out and so we’re seeing which requires a lot of heavy equipment, construction equipment even some apply to small end of resource industries equipment",pos,train
"Until the long end of the curve moves up, we're going to continue to see value in the municipals as one of more attractive investments",pos,train
I think that will be manifested a lot in technology making sure that we're keeping up with competition and our value proposition,pos,train
Our multi-faceted concentrated effort to effectively grow the consumer loan portfolio included streamlining processes to increase efficiencies in our loan center and hiring additional key lenders,pos,train
"In consumer banking, we continue to gain momentum from the investments we've made in our value proposition, including things like 24/7 customer service",pos,train
"So as we do that we create feedstock for future years and the cost of holding that feedstocks and it continues to go down as interest rates have gone up and you see, let's say the Fed numbers increase",pos,train
"Jennifer, we will continue to focus on the goals that we had in 2017 and just continuing to execute",pos,train
I mean we've been increasing our value proposition to our employees over the last few months and we'll continue to do that,pos,train
"But I think I'm most excited about is, is not hidden home loans because we make a great decision on interest rates swap directionally",pos,train
Is there underlying goal maybe to increase the loan proportion to assets on the balance sheet? Or are there things with the balance sheet that you're trying to accomplish this year?,pos,train
"We will be investing and have been, and we will continue to invest in technology, and we've been investing in our value proposition",pos,train
"We intend such statements to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended",pos,train
"We want to continue to maintain that in place and increase it as our prospects increase, so we'll focus on that",pos,train
"We are growing larger deals which we renew that we've shown over the last 18 months, 24 months, the continuing momentum and focus on growing, what we call around here the core loans; these are relationships under $10 million",pos,train
"Total period-end consumer loans grew by 11% or $155 million compared to the same timeframe in 2016, about 56% of this growth coming from consumer real estate such as home equity lines of credit, on improvement loans HELOC and home equity loans closed in with that just driven by general consumer and consumer lines of credit, particularly private banking",pos,train
The people that we're hiring and we've talked about technology that we're going to have to spend that we have spent on infrastructure and on product development,pos,train
Power and the American Banker/Reputation Institute Survey and we continue to build on that success,pos,test
"And it is fair to say that I mean you funded entire loan growth this year with deposits, should we expect the same continuing in 2018?",pos,train
"Our strategy of building our core loan portfolio, which we defined as loan relationships under $10 million in size, continues to help provide steady, sustainable, organic growth",pos,train
"However, with our four pillar strategy that I laid out earlier in the call, we believe that going to position us well, getting more of our business digitally focused which is not just ecommerce but it's also digitizing our own business so we can take more OpEx out",pos,train
We are about half way through the transformation project and we are heading where we expect to believe with respect to savings which include both growth project as well as cost reduction projects and we see that those four things is helping us shore up our margins going forward and being able to offset what we've seen as far as pressure from the suppliers,pos,train
"Our transformation initiative is one of the most important as it reaches across the entire company, encompassing organization structure; get its processes to leverage the strength of Avnet",pos,train
"It also serves as a foundation for IoT partner ecosystem which creates vertical solutions that allows customers to develop applications, build on secure and scalable IoT infrastructure",pos,train
We have others supplier that have those similar technologies that we can move forward with,pos,train
We are very excited about the opportunity to leverage these relationships across our broad customer base so that they too can take full advantage of the digital transformation opportunity that IoT represent,pos,train
So -- and is that the opportunity as you go forward or there are some -- I guess with improving Farnell integration in Europe you still have some room to go there as well,pos,train
"And when we do our Analyst Day we will be real specific about what we think the seasonality is by quarter, we will lay that out for you",pos,train
"With respect to the nine suppliers and franchise, some of that, the fact we have the ability to utilize some of the supply lines that are in Avnet and therefore we are able to now win in Premier Farnell because of the relationship between Premier Farnell and Avnet",pos,train
"In addition to his wealth of experience, Tom has an impressive track record helping transform businesses to drive financial growth and shareholder value",pos,train
And I also like thank Ken Jacobson for the outstanding job that he did as Interim CFO as we make steady progress on our financial commitment under his leadership,pos,train
"That's a good thing Second thing is we implemented the first ERP system since the Americas one highly successful in Europe and we had inventories build up in order to make sure that we were prepared for any glitch that might occur which didn't occur because we had essentially knock on wood, a flawless implication and to those are primary reasons why the inventory went up a bit and our game plan going forward support that by bringing down working capital and working capital day",pos,train
"And Europe as we touched on earlier is continue to show strength, good strength in both you have automotive by the way and I should note automotive in all regions we are seeing good growth",pos,train
"So we are seeing good organic growth in Europe, accelerated continued growth as we talked about earlier in Asia Pac and as we talk our Americas numbers are starting to get better and that is helping tremendously, okay on not only the Bill pointed earlier on the top line but also on the bottom line as we get more help in the Americas",pos,train
"I wouldn't say Marvell win big one, I think that will start to have a bigger impact towards in the balance of the calendar year but that wouldn't be -- some of that would be in there but not a whole lot at this point in time, Mark",pos,test
Our growth initiative continues to gain traction is evidenced by an improvement in sales process metrics this quarter,pos,train
"With an improving book-to-bill and an improving confidence of our suppliers and customers, we expect to continue to strength as we enter into the second half of fiscal 2018",pos,train
"And we think that's going to continue, as Bill pointing out the positive book-to-bill backlog is growing and we are gaining more customers as far as confidence here at home in Americas",pos,train
This will be based on the European system so that we can leverage the skills and experience on this critical next phase on our pathway global system,pos,train
"Going forward, our intention is to maintain the same capital allocation priorities we have pursued in the past invest in organic growth, returning excess cash via disciplined share repurchase and dividend program and invest in strategic M&A opportunities",pos,train
"By increasing our investment in new systems we believe we'll be able to enhance the customer experience, drive greater productivity and leverage big data and advanced analytics to support growth initiative",pos,train
I want to congratulate the European team and our global IT organization on this significant milestone as we move closer to our goal of a global system that will provide greater efficiencies and data sharing across our businesses,pos,train
"Designed to make the manufacturing process for startups less daunting, the Hardware Studio booth provide live streaming broadcast and demos through stock startup as well as one-on-one session with creators and engineers to get tips on factory selection, sourcing, manufacturing and much more",pos,test
Our goal is to provide critical services at each stage of the product lifecycle as we help customers move from idea to product and from product to market,pos,train
And to contemplate going backward from there is a considerable undertaking and ultimately one we didn't think would be as successful as the converse and that is our go forward strategy,pos,train
"That’s just general trends that we're seeing in the market and I’d go back to the earlier comments as we continue to switch to a retail strategy on multifamily and that will be one of our larger categories for growth, we should start to see some yield pick up as we make that transition to the retail strategy and beyond that in the private banking space and in the C&I space as well",pos,train
So we'll have some of that recalled and then we’ll also repurchase as we control that run down,pos,train
"One of the things that we have talked about is having a much higher component of retail driven multifamily business versus brokered, which has a degree of higher price content opportunity as well as deposit content opportunity and that will play out throughout 2018 and beyond",pos,train
"So while real estate will always be a very significant component of who we are, we also intend to build out very aggressively other portions of our loan book",pos,train
"Of these balances, we believe approximately $600 million are relationships and products that fit within our go forward strategy and from here will be reflecting our current business unit deposit totals",pos,train
"Maybe a little bit more broadly on credit, we remain very comfortable with our asset quality and the bank continues to focus on our core markets in California",pos,train
"We remain focused on our core lending products as we spoke about earlier the CRE multifamily, residential mortgages, warehouse and C&I and we maintain a conservative credit box",pos,train
"So as we look forward, we're comfortable with the economic view of California, comfortable with the existing profile of the portfolio",pos,train
So again we're starting from a very high point in our overall mix of investment securities relative to the balance sheet size,pos,test
So we want to start to migrate ourselves down to something that looks more like a peer institution and that migration occur as we see loan growth occur,pos,train
"We have $70 million, I think it's $70 million – about $75 million of those loans that sit on our balance sheet as of the end of the quarter",pos,train
"We get a good deal of questions from investors as to how, what and when of our go forward plan",pos,train
"Going into 2018, our goal is to amplify this momentum to generate additional high quality loans that fit within our risk appetite and that will continue to support the remix into a more traditional bank balance sheet",pos,train
"I'm just wondering given the amount of pressure on deposit costs and the need to kind of remake that your earnings to more runoff and the cost of growing that, why put additional pressure on the balance sheet and the funding need as opposed to running off of more or allowing more of the securities portfolio cash flows to sort of reduce the need for incremental deposits?",pos,test
We believe earning asset levels have stabilized and have the opportunity to grow higher from here as we put on new loans and grow revenues,pos,train
They will continue to work out those loans to resolution,pos,test
"On the recruiting side, we believe there are many talented individuals in our markets that want to be part of what we are building here at Banc of California",pos,test
"We believe we are well positioned with the balance sheet, products and capital to serve clients across our markets",pos,train
"And as we transitioned from more of a brokered strategy to more of a retail strategy, we're also seeing some pricing improvement",pos,train
"Changing the sales culture of our front-line team to be deposit minded in addition to hiring additional deposit gatherers should drive growth of core low cost deposits, but this growth will take time",pos,train
"As we work toward a balance sheet that is increasingly core funded and less volatile, we will indeed continue to utilize the FHLB and other wholesale funding to supplement the net asset growth",pos,train
So we have said that we believe and you're seeing it here in the fourth quarter that we will reduce that securities book and have started that program as we have begun to increase the loan book,pos,train
So over time that the securities book will come down from its approximate 27% level and the loan book will continue to grow and that's the goal,pos,train
"And as it relates to the institutional bank deposits, I think the comment was there's about $850 million left, about $600 million of that’s viewed as core and will be moved over to a different bucket going forward",pos,train
"As you would expect, these performance criteria will ultimately follow a structure similar to my own and those of our executive officers and we consistent with any guideposts we publicly announce",pos,train
"And once that diligence is completed and we move forward with the disposition of that asset, you would expect that to occur in the early part of the second quarter",pos,train
"But primarily looking at that multi-family segment I guess what were the yields on originated production in the fourth quarter there? And as you look at future loan growth, if this is going to be coming from the multifamily segment and commercial real estate where the flatter yield curve is really impacting those spreads and you're putting out wholesale and costlier funding to support that",pos,train
"Our primary goal is growing incremental core low cost deposit funding, but we recognize premier deposit franchises take years to build",pos,train
"In the meantime, we expect to continue to utilize broker deposits as well as FHLB advances as needed while our core deposit strategies are implemented",pos,train
I continue to be proud of the deep and experienced talent we have across our company with 750 colleagues serving California’s businesses and entrepreneurs each and every day,pos,train
"I want to remind everyone that, as always, certain elements of this presentation are forward-looking, and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today",pos,train
"This number is not overly an outlier for our balance sheet and business mix, although we recognize we have an opportunity to improve this ratio over time by leveraging our existing expense base and growing the asset base",pos,train
"And if I may we have said, we will have a lot more to say about 2018 outlook in the first week of February",pos,train
"During the quarter, we continue to execute in our plan to remix and reorient the balance sheet toward more traditional and core assets",pos,train
"Yeah, so certainly on a go forward basis, we will have gain on sale related to SBA loans as we originate and sell those",pos,train
"And so as part of the production capabilities in both the single family and the multifamily, we will look at opportunities to selectively sell some of the production that's over and above what we might necessarily want to keep on the balance sheet",pos,train
These fourth quarter results reflect a continued execution of our plan to remix the balance sheet and focus the company on organic growth opportunities,pos,train
Is it safe to say that going forward all loan sales and servicing income and everything associated with that will be purely SBA driven once that sale takes place?,pos,train
"Alongside the long growth, we enjoyed, we continue to reduce our securities balances including fully exiting the remainder of the corporate bank debt portfolio, reducing CLO balances by $117 million and completing the sale of $24 million of MLP debt securities",pos,train
So we'll continue to manage the overall balance for that investment security over time and get it to be a little bit more of a right-sized,pos,train
"I know I’m giving you a percentage versus that, but it’s the best way to think about because it will fall pretty at that level into the free cash flow category",pos,train
"We remain focused on increasing rates and enhancing segmentation and what discipline underwriting, enhanced reinsurance coverage to mitigate property cat risk and improving claims management",pos,train
"We will continue to look at opportunities for continued investment as we have and we modulate that appropriately, so we would say that some of that we would like to continue to invest – continue to invest as we do with the other aspects of our free cash flow and some of that will be return as well",pos,train
"So -- and return as you saw last year we did some small acquisitions, so we think that would also be a way that utilizes some of the cash that we’re generating",pos,train
We expect RBC to improve as we move through 2018,pos,train
And so as their advisors continue to look at doing business that way – more of the flows will continue to go into that area,pos,train
We’re also aiding products where we see opportunities that include our multi-asset solutions business where we are generating solid flows in our adaptive risk and diversify real return strategies in the U,pos,train
"I would say, if you -- as we go through, again, we’re going to be looking to invest for growth",pos,test
"But I would say on normalize patterns it certainly tie to our revenue growth and growth in revenue, but getting back into three to five range and staying in that range, because we will be investing in the business and obviously there is volume associate expenses",pos,train
"There are changes occurring in the recruiting landscape, but I believe we well situated to continue to attract good advisors who appreciate our advice value proposition and client centric culture",pos,train
Management believes this enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis,pos,train
"The lower corporate rate will provide additional opportunities for further free cash and capital generation, which we’ll further invest in the business while generating a good shareholder return",pos,train
"We continue to generate consistent competitive performance with about 70% of our funds, equities, fixed income and asset allocation above [Indiscernible] or benchmarks for one, three and five year timeframes",pos,train
"That basically, we ate the larger portion on that and it’s – so we will evaluate and the team is evaluating what aspects will be then put into pricing and then obviously we have to be competitive, and ensure and pass through the years state filters, but certainly it will be evaluating if it is part of the regular trend line and is incorporated we will stop pricing for it",pos,train
"We make good progress in 2017 and once completed, we will strengthen our operating capabilities considerably, improve flexibility and our ability to offer customized solutions and increase efficiency",pos,train
"We will generate some efficiency gains, but also we’ll be incurring expenses as it relates -- relates to Brexit, relates to the every elements",pos,train
But it certainly the capabilities that gives us is going to be vastly beyond the dollar saving,pos,train
"Now that we’re not concentrating on the DOL activities and we’re investing both in technology as well as in a capability over the course of the year to even bring our client experience to life even more so, our advice experience, the digital advice tools that we’re going to put into our advisors hands",pos,train
And some of the things Walter said is investment it's in some good technology including and some of our contact activities and engagement activities for clients,pos,train
So over the course of the year we’re continuing to really deploy and invest in better capabilities to help our advisors even be more engaged,pos,train
So we will remain competitive and we are competitive and so will have to gauge,pos,train
But I imagine we would -- the percent would increase if we -- that's what I would think and we'll have to gauge the competitive reactions,pos,train
Another key priority is increase in Columbia Threadneedle’s brand awareness,pos,train
"So we are seeing competitors are being fairly consistent and we’re certainly observing, but at this stage it's very tough to gauge the exact amount that will be proportionally to us and to shareholder based upon the situation",pos,train
So we feel very good about our ability to continue to recruit appropriately if advisors are interested in joining us,pos,train
And so from that perspective we’ll continue to recruit in the marketplace and we feel that our value proposition is strong,pos,train
"As we move forward, our wealth management business is situated well",pos,train
We’re continuing to look at opportunities that still up in the marketplace or that we think would be of interest to us appropriately,pos,train
"So we're constantly looking at that and will to 2018, we think the marketplace is open in that sense and things will come out this year",pos,train
"But there will be small acquisitions along those lines, but ones that we can bolt-on",pos,train
"I think as Lloyd pointed out, where we'll see some reductions is in the professional services lines related to the risk management related work around compliance BSA and related activities in terms of the build out of the infrastructure there that will decline meaningfully in the second half of 2018",pos,train
"So as we wind down that investment in bringing up our risk infrastructure to what’s appropriate for a $10 billion plus bank, you'll see that number come down",pos,test
"We also have made and are continuing to make significant investments in our risk management and IT infrastructure, positioning the company for continued growth and scale",pos,train
"Before commenting on some of our credit metrics, I again will make my usual statement that Banner's metrics are not likely to improve further as we move toward the next credit cycle",pos,train
"On share repurchase, can we assume that that activity will continue, depending upon where your stock trades obviously, but should we start to maybe build in some repurchase activity each and every quarter",pos,train
"And with regards to the advertising expenses, there is some seasonality over the last couple of fourth quarters, the trend in expenses is not the exact amount in 2017, is that a good way to look at modeling that expense going forward?",pos,train
Our core full-year 2017 performance clearly demonstrates that our strategic plan is effective and we continue building shareholder value,pos,train
"And so as we re-leverage the balance sheet, we’ll benefit from some higher rates on the securities portfolio",pos,train
"So there's some offset there, but we're optimistic that the margin will hold in there and probably be just a little bit stronger going forward",pos,train
"30 due to the gain on the sale of Utah operations, partially offset by the loss of security sold as part of the balance sheet de-leveraging strategy to remain below 10 billion at year-end",pos,train
The sale of the seven Utah branches and the balance sheet restructuring that we engineered to position the company year-end assets below $10 billion in order to postpone the adverse effects of the Durbin Amendment for another year,pos,train
"Just looking at the balance sheet from a strategic perspective, if you could just provide an update on how you're thinking of growth for the entire year, inclusive of the re-leveraging and then growth that you might see in the latter half? And how much, if you were to find yourself in a similar position in November, December of 2018, how much wiggle room you might have to be able to do what was done in the past two years again? And if that's something you would look to pursue at that time",pos,train
"Again, as I said earlier, 30 plus percent of it in 2017 was related to the build out of the infrastructure, so you can think about that number as a potential opportunity for reduction",pos,train
"I would take it as testimony against my PowerPoint that it means that small cells are necessary, and there's going to be a lot of them, and carriers are going to use self-perform and multiple co-location infrastructure providers to do that",pos,train
"And a great -- as we look at the team, we have a great deal of respect for what they've been able to build and develop as a business over a long period of time",pos,train
"I don't want to give any expectation beyond calendar year 2018, but we do expect there's going to continue to be meaningful investment and leasing activity across both components of our business, both towers and small cells, for a long period of time",pos,test
"The escalation provisions are carried forward on the same terms, that the sites that are being used by the carriers today are going to continue to need to be used for a long period of time and into the future, and there's more activity coming on them to the point that they're willing to contract and commit to that",pos,train
"I would say across all four of the operators, we're seeing them use the asset in multiple different ways, so not just for small cells but, as we've talked about, some of the other offerings that we have on the fiber solutions side",pos,train
"We believe the addressable market here for small cells and the pie, so to speak, is expanding rapidly and is going to continue to expand",pos,train
"Well, in the litany of things that I mentioned, whether it's autonomous cars, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things across virtually every business and all industry, people are looking to utilize wireless as a means by finding cost efficiencies inside of their business",pos,train
"What's exciting to us is, in most cases, the applications that are being looked at, they require faster speeds and lower latency, which -- there's two ways to solve that, additional spectrum can be owned, for which that's a very limited resource; and additional infrastructure across which to deploy that spectrum",pos,train
"But as Jay pointed out earlier, majority of that is really going to be into building new assets and putting it into small cell deployments that we've been talking about to meet the pipeline that we have in place as well as to expand the fiber footprint with regard to the fiber solutions business",pos,test
And so we're planning to grow and build those businesses because we think the platforms that they have and the markets in which they operate are valuable and able to be expanded,pos,train
We've seen that play out over the period of time that we've owned the assets both in terms of the new leasing activity as well as the churn levels,pos,train
We believe these capital allocation decisions will drive significant long-term growth in our dividend per share as we add small cell and fiber solutions customers to these high-capacity metro fiber assets,pos,train
"So we feel like -- we're talking about earlier, however our customers choose to try to improve their networks to meet their demand, that we're positioned to get that spend",pos,train
"And if we get to the point where we've filled up and used up all of the fiber that we're putting in, the returns that we will have achieved on that basis will be in excess of what we're underwriting, and then it will be a great outcome for our company and for our shareholders",pos,train
"We may find, over time, if we integrate the asset and start to expand, that there are some cost synergies that we're able to achieve from suppliers and other sources",pos,train
"But our focus is really on the growth opportunity that is in front of us, and we believe the revenue synergies here are really the greatest opportunity in front",pos,train
"And over time, we may find that there are some cost synergies, but we'd certainly expect, with regards to the people that we've gained over these various acquisitions, that there really are not any cost synergies there around people, which is a significant portion of the cost structure",pos,train
"With regards to future activities and investment, it's going to take us a little bit of time to invest -- to digest the assets that we've acquired, Lightower being the most recent large acquisition",pos,train
Is that indicative of what we should expect kind of going forward? Or is the activity more in-quarter? Or is it kind of showing that tower growth in the future can ramp?,pos,train
"And we managed this while proactively improving our balance sheet flexibility, increasing the average maturity on our debt, lowering our average interest rate and reducing our leverage",pos,train
"To meet this demand, our strategy is to provide differentiated fiber solutions that serve high-bandwidth, multi-location customers such as large enterprise, health care providers and educational institutions",pos,train
"This strategy allows us to enhance our competitive position in small cells by increasing the opportunities we serve with the underlying fiber assets, thereby improving the already attractive shared economic model we see in our small cell business",pos,train
"I would say that, that's an example of self-fulfillment, where the carriers are looking for opportunities given the scale and number of small cells that are coming and the investment that's going to have to happen around cell site densification",pos,train
"And that is an example of a party that's providing capital, and they're using it to deploy small cells and would be an example of what I was speaking to earlier around self-performing the deployment of small cells",pos,train
"We believe, fundamentally, the infrastructure is going to change as we move into a 5G world, and we're seeing the benefit of that in 4G",pos,train
"If 5G ultimately comes to fruition like we believe it will, we've positioned the company to benefit in the same way with small cells and fiber that we benefited over the last couple of decades from the macro tower investments that we made",pos,train
We don't believe so because what we're looking for is to continue to add dense deep metro fiber in the top markets in the U,pos,train
So we feel really good about our investment and what it looks like going forward because of that,pos,train
"What percentage of total capital investments do you think carriers are going to spend on macro versus small cells -- macro towers versus small cells today? And where does it go in the future? I mean, Verizon essentially guided to flat CapEx year-over-year but also has plans for a significant fiber build",pos,train
"So some of the point that Dan was making earlier around us continuing to see the pipeline for new small cells continuing to build, some of those are going on fiber that's existing for which we can expeditiously get those tenants on the fiber",pos,train
"And then some of this is we're continuing to expand our footprint, and that's a 2-year cycle",pos,train
"So we're continuing -- to the points that I made in my comments earlier, we're continuing to expand what is the future opportunity as we're building additional assets",pos,train
"And by far, if you're really at a high-level talk about what's the biggest constraint to growth, it's the time it takes to own enough assets, but then you benefit from step 2, which is going back and adding additional leases to that existing footprint",pos,test
"And we think that that's going to continue for the end of 2018 and then beyond because, as Jay was mentioning, our carrier customers are investing to try to keep pace with the demand that's coming",pos,train
"So we still see, like I said before, really good activity across the board, and I think that it's going to continue to translate into new leasing activity, as we did in our prior outlook",pos,test
"We are focused on generating attractive near-term returns for our shareholders, consisting of a high-quality dividend that we expect to grow 7% to 8% annually, while investing in assets and capabilities we believe are necessary to convert data demand growth into cash flow growth for decades to come",pos,train
"And on top of that, we're going to see carriers, I think, invest and self perform, and we'll probably have other infrastructure providers come into the market and provide solutions in places where we don't",pos,train
"There's multiple carriers in the market talking about how big the opportunity here is for small cells, and the need for fiber is core to that",pos,train
So I think you're going to continue to see others beyond just us invest in fiber and then use that fiber for things like small cells,pos,train
"And so what we're going to do going forward is what we've done up to date, which is give more color around the revenue source because we can break that up pretty easily between small cells and fiber",pos,train
"What we will continue to do is give more color, like we have, around the revenue, the new leasing activity, the escalators and churn associated with each of the towers, fiber solutions and small cell businesses to try to get more color for investors to be able to see",pos,test
"In most cases, the clarity and the speed element of why they would be interested in doing that would relate to locations where they already are because they have more of a sense of where their network is and what needs to happen to that network",pos,test
"And then as we roll into 2019, that would move from acquisitions over to the new leasing activity",pos,train
"We continue to see increasing levels of investment activity from our major customers that is resulting in an expected increase in 2018 new leasing activity across towers, small cells and fiber solutions as compared to the new leasing activity we saw in 2017",pos,train
"Some of those -- some of that spectrum have periods of time that starts to come to fruition here in the next couple of years, where, in order to maintain the license, the spectrum has to be deployed and developed on towers",pos,train
"And if we see a meaningful step-up in terms of what that pipeline is and what that looks like, we'll certainly update you on that as we go",pos,train
"Most of it's going to be fiber-fed or fiber backhaul, and we're in the best position, we think, in the markets where we have that fiber to take up that lease-up opportunity",pos,train
So we're working with our customers to try to figure out where we make the most sense and understand there are going to be places where that may not be true,pos,train
"We underwrote the world and our investments, as I talked about earlier, based on existing applications, which would be 4G wireless world, and did not project what 5G could mean",pos,train
"Most of what happened when we went from 3G to 4G was around increasing some capacity in the network by adding additional cell sites, but most of the activity actually occurred on the sites where they're already existing, and we saw additional co-location on new tower sites",pos,train
"While businesses globally are trying to emulate companies like Uber, who are driving efficiencies by sharing resources, we have shown for 2 decades that the sharing of our infrastructure across multiple parties provides the lowest cost and fastest time-to-market for our customers while delivering compelling financial returns for our company",pos,train
"While we have positioned Crown Castle for the future, we remain focused on consistently delivering value to our shareholders by converting the demand for our assets into growth in dividends",pos,test
"Our ability to consistently generate near-term operating performance and shareholder returns while investing in the future growth of our company is a testament to the quality of our business, assets and people, and we believe it sets us apart",pos,train
"From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to improve our financial flexibility while focusing on maintaining our investment-grade credit profile",pos,train
"And the only other thing I'd add on that, Simon, is that our pipeline for small cell nodes does continue to creep up a little bit even as we are delivering certain nodes within a quarter or period",pos,train
"To the point that I made earlier around towers and small cells being connected with high-capacity fiber, a part of that is driven by the need to push computing tower to the very edge of the network",pos,train
So we're continuing to see opportunities to trial activities and learn about that business,pos,train
"We believe that will be a long-term driver of the need for our infrastructure, and so we're still in the learning and trial phase",pos,test
"But in the short term here, I think it we're going to be digesting the assets that we found",pos,train
"Given the growth rates there, we will probably – not probably, we will absolutely be ramping up the size of the sales force effort and perhaps focusing even more on – not just the large clients, but also mid markets",pos,train
So we would expect that to be a big area for us to push,pos,train
"So overall, I think it was – certainly – it was an exciting year and I hopefully as we move into 2018 it will be a little less exciting and a little more fun",pos,test
"Fourth quarter, we kept it to 12 months forward coverage, which is likely where we’ll stay until we see it stabilized and potentially drop lower",pos,train
It would allow us to take savings accounts and other non-demand deposits diversifying our funding sources and helping funding rates,pos,train
The first bucket would be to accelerate some existing projects that we have on the board,pos,train
So it's – we're trying to live the spirit of the agreements as well as what we believe is the appropriate thing to do and we can talk about that during Q&A,pos,train
"And then lastly, shifting to Epsilon, you noted that tightening the labor market, curious – you obviously took a lot of initiatives in recent years on the offshoring side to address that? Did you feel like based on the mix of skill sets that are needed the composition of Epsilon as it exists today? Is off-shoring as an option pretty much run its course or are there additional opportunities there?",pos,test
"It is also a very big market as long as we can hit the price point and we can deliver in a timely fashion where they're saying, look, I don't want to be the ones responsible for figuring out how the watch is made",pos,train
"Essentially, it’s a one-year grow over that we had to play through that we needed to restore bonuses in order to maintain highly competitive compensation packages going forward",pos,train
"So we continue to see the interest coming from many different areas, and that gives us a lot of comfort on what we're going to do going forward",pos,test
"So the sandbox itself is getting bigger and bigger, so I would say the vast majority of it are more and more folks who are getting into the whole concept of hey, we can use this data and loyalty platforms to understand the customers and market to them",pos,train
"And then just a follow-up on capital allocation, Charles, you highlighted $1 billion of unencumbered free cash flow, how are you thinking about capital allocation priorities with your stock at its current price? Let’s say balance against potential acquisition and/or divestiture opportunities?",pos,train
"The one goal where we came up short was promotional spend from our clients, which represents about a third of all the miles that we issue was quite soft",pos,train
That's what we’re looking to continue into 2018 and start building up a level of consistency that people feel comfortable with,pos,train
"So you always have to focus on the reserve divided by the reservable AR, which would not include the bulk of Signet in that number",pos,train
The proportion that of our associate base that’s over there versus here is probably getting to be at the point where we find it’s comfortable and I don't think there will be a huge shift either way going forward,pos,train
Really the focus that I have is to make sure that all three of our segments are fine and back on track and based upon those trends will determine how we deploy that capital,pos,train
I look forward to the leadership and expertise that you will bring to his new role,pos,test
"What we’ve seen in terms of PORs is, sometimes a customer will bring this pad in for one application, really see the performance benefits as well as the cost of ownership benefits and then proliferate it to other portions of their CMP process",pos,train
"As in previous years, we remain mindful of potential order fluctuations and volatility around the Lunar New Year, which this year begins on February 16",pos,train
"Discussion focused on future drivers of semiconductor demand including cloud connectivity, which should continue to drive strong memory demand, as well as augmented reality, artificial intelligence, automotive applications, high performance computing and cryptocurrencies, which should all be drivers of advanced logic",pos,train
"We would hope at some point to be able to speak about some of those things, but we’re going to continue with the cash deployment that has been a strength, I think, in terms of staying disciplined in the past, but we’re also interested in using our capital strength to help drive the future of the company",pos,train
"I think as we outline our deployment of capital priorities going forward, they continue to be as they’ve been in the past with spending on organic growth to drive the business, paying dividends, which we’ve recently initiated and we have continued to do, M&A and then share repurchases as a fourth",pos,train
"Our tungsten growth was driven by strong demand from both memory and logic applications, including 3D memory and FinFET, we expect this key product area will continue to drive profitable growth for our company",pos,train
"Yes, I think we just going – looking beyond, I think we’ve been very effective to control our raw material cost, and we would expect that to continue to be the case going forward",pos,train
"So I wouldn’t want to put a number out there beyond 2019, but you would expect continued strong management of the supply chain as we’ve demonstrated in the past",pos,train
"One thing I’d comment also is, when they talk about some of the growth rates, memory, of course, is really sensitive to the pricing, so when they talk about what their expectations for growth are, some of those are intermixed with what they expect ASPs to do as well",pos,train
"But overall, we see a really strong memory growth environment that was also the consensus that ISS that memory is going to drive the unit growth in 2018 and that should position us really well for continued growth in that area as well",pos,train
"We believe we are well positioned to benefit from these longer-term industry trends and remain confident about the critical role, highly engineered materials and highly formulate CMP solutions like ours will play in the semiconductor industry going forward",pos,train
"So quarter-to-quarter, there’s going to be some volatility, but we’re really excited",pos,train
"But overall, what we see is continued strong investment in just the China government, investing in the semiconductor supply chain and we see a strong growth trajectory in the future as well",pos,train
"Some of that’s coming from the international players like TSMC, Samsung, Hynix, who are continuing to ramp up their fabs, also Intel in Dalian, very active",pos,test
"We believe that ongoing effective execution in these key product areas combined with our focused business model and global resources, capabilities and infrastructure continue to differentiate us among leading suppliers of specialty materials to the semiconductor industry and position us well to deliver another year of strong performance",pos,test
We continue to leverage our global sales channel and technical resources to speed the qualification and adoption of our pad offerings as we have previously discussed,pos,train
Here we expect continued growth as we aim to displacing incumbents and replace some of our own legacy solutions and continue to improve profitability,pos,train
"Our strong cash generation model has enabled us to implement a balanced capital deployment strategy over the years for which our priorities continue to be, funding organic investments to improve our global capabilities and our core CMP consumables business, paying dividends, acquisitions in closely-related areas and share repurchases",pos,train
"And so – and part of that strategy, of course, is also to improve our profitability and that product area as well",pos,train
"On your second point, I think when you go in one case, which was our previous case, and you’re looking to repair the balance sheet and make sure that PSO is moving forward in a positive fashion from an investment standpoint, we pulled several hundred million dollars of investment out of Oklahoma after that last rate case, and the present rate case, to have an ALJ recommendation that’s not helpful at all in terms of continuing the recovering of PSO, if the commission follows suit with that, that’s just another really bad message about investment in Oklahoma",pos,test
We are certainly hopeful that the Oklahoma commission will revise the ALJ’s recommendation in the rate case to send a message that Oklahoma is truly open for business and allow AEP to continue to make substantial investments in the energy infrastructure in that state,pos,train
"We also, because of our strong credit metrics, are able to maintain a significant portion of our capital investment plans while not issuing any additional equity beyond what we provided at the last EEI financial conference",pos,train
"Because we provide such a critical service to our customers and communities we serve, AEP has a public trust to balance the needs of our investors with our customers and our other stakeholders",pos,train
"We are in a very critical time in the life of this project, and this is where AEP, our customers and our regulators need to make this happen",pos,train
"Now there again, it is an ALJ recommendation, and the commission itself will be making the determination, and we’re certainly hopeful that those adjustments will be made and that’s what we expect to happen",pos,train
"Let me follow up on Steve’s question just a quick bit, because I want to understand a little bit around the compartmentalization of Wind Catcher to the extent to which should one piece or another fall away as part of the approval process, can you ultimately move forward with this under a smaller context, or perhaps just under the wind or the transmission piece? Just want to frame the risk of the project moving forward again as you work through the settlement, and obviously I don’t want to necessarily prejudge anything with respect to the settlement either",pos,train
"5% and we’ll continue to see--all those, as we’ve discussed with you earlier, gives you a very good view of the ones that need to move up and those that are in the middle of rate cases, and we expect those outcomes in the next couple of quarters, so that will be very instructive to us going forward relative to where we put our investments",pos,train
"We change at $500 million in the third year of our forecast, but by being able to keep that investment essentially the same, that allows us to stay in that growth range",pos,train
"Like I said, it’s in a critical part of the Wind Catcher timeline when you’re in this time frame with the testimony done and being able to have those kinds of discussions, so",pos,train
"If all states don’t approve it, then we’ll just have to look at it at the time, because I think there may be other takers out there that might be interested, so we’ll see",pos,train
"Now, that would be well within the range of guidance you gave for 2018, so is it fair that even though there is a fairly large swing in outcomes there, that you reiterated your guidance because you’re so comfortable you can be in there? Then the second question is, what’s your recourse to Oklahoma if they in fact, other than just pulling capital out of the state or selling the company if indeed the ALJ decision comes down as approved as rendered?",pos,train
"So the augmentation of that along with what’s going on, on the distribution side - you know, we talked about $500 million of additional incremental investments to be made in distribution on grid modernization that’s not in the plan, these are all things that are changing as time goes on, and when you see the adoption of electric vehicles and all those things that are occurring, there is some important catalysts that we’re seeing in the future that we plan on taking advantage of",pos,train
"Our employees continue to drive efficiencies across our business, which certainly played a significant role in meeting shareholder expectations in 2017",pos,train
"Now just keep in mind, as I said earlier, that if we get Wind Catcher and other things that we’ve talked about during EEI Financial, then that can certainly be helpful; but overall, we’re looking at 5 to 7%",pos,train
Disciplined execution and capital allocation will be key for us to meet our financial objectives,pos,train
"In addition, over time we have grown our dividend with earnings, and expect to be able to do so going forward",pos,train
"Now, I think that obviously lowering rates to customers is a critical component of this, but at the same time there are distinct opportunities that we’ve had discussions with commissions about previously that we could take advantage of and really have a real positive outcome for not only the customers but also in terms of ensuring that we’re moving ahead in a positive way, whether that’s capital investment to focus on the customer experience, whether it’s certainly things we can do with plant balances to accelerate depreciation and so forth",pos,train
"Yes Greg, so the IRS hasn’t written their rules yet, but we think what’s allowed for in the tax law is that parent company interest expense can be allocated to both our regulated properties and to our competitive businesses",pos,train
"Now that being said, I will say that we are not going to move forward with a project that we don’t feel like is beneficial not only to our customers - obviously it’s beneficial to our customer, but our shareholders have to benefit as well, and we have a lot of places we can put our capital, and we just need to make sure it’s done--as I mentioned earlier in my opening, the allocation of capital is going to be extremely important for us to focus in and prioritize our investments to ensure we meet our financial objectives",pos,test
"Wind Catcher is only a part of that - actually, it’s incremental to the entire plan that we have today, and we’re going to make sure it stands on its own merits",pos,train
So those cases move forward and certainly that should help to improve I&M,pos,train
"Then finally as we try to compare the capex, where you’re taking the $500 million out of the 2020 number, it looks like you’ve got some moving parts in there, but the corporate pieces, I was just curious what’s behind that and some of the other moving parts in the capex forecast",pos,train
"Also, as you’re looking at the project and assuming it gets approved and everything, is the plan still to own 100% of this or is there a scenario where you could sell down a piece to a third party or reduce that ownership?",pos,test
"Those legacy issues will roll off over time - some roll off in ’18, some roll off in ’19, so you’ll start to see those two bubbles come closer together and in fact become the same bubble as we move forward",pos,train
"5 billion project, so that is a significant change to what we’ve talked about in our capital and financing plans, so we’d need to come out to you and tell you a complete story about what Wind Catcher means, when we get approvals and when we decide to go forward with that project",pos,train
"That will certainly bode well for the continuation of Wind Catcher, and certainly that case continues to move forward in Oklahoma as well, so a lot of cases coming in and Oklahoma is at the epicenter of the activity associated with investments that we’re making",pos,train
"We have plenty of places to put our capital, and so Oklahoma would wind up being sort of in the red area like Kentucky was",pos,test
"The other is the economic development that’s occurring in those regions, and we are getting some positive progress there relative placements of large manufacturing in our territories, so that’s a good outcome, and we expect that to continue to improve",pos,train
"So largely spread across our businesses, but our preferences for where we put capital to work will remain the same",pos,train
"The part that moves as a part of the negotiations is really the billion or so of excess ADIT, and what we’ve shown in the slide in the deck on Page 36 is what we believe is a conservative allotment of that",pos,train
"I can’t really talk about the content of those discussions because obviously they’re confidential, but again we’ve made additional guarantees and rebuttal testimony, we’ve put that out as a framework for those customer protection type of mechanisms, and you might suspect that’s where the dialog is centered",pos,test
"I mean, other projects will have to stand on their own merits, just like our project",pos,train
"So there may be opportunities to look at right-of-ways and some element of consistency, but other than that, though, there is really--they’re just different",pos,train
"They’re originating different, the takers are different, and so I would say there’s plenty of wind in Oklahoma, there’s plenty of opportunity for development, and there’s plenty of ability to continue to move that process forward",pos,train
"I mean, in essence what we’re doing is trading FFO to debt and that ability to carry that against not having to issue equity, so it’s a positive outcome for our shareholders",pos,train
"I guess the rate base CAGR is going up, you’ve had some good results on the pension side as well, and I know you have to raise your debt financing a bit, but that’s certainly an accretive use of money in terms of the rate base CAGR",pos,train
"But leave it to me to kick a dead horse here, so just going back to the opening remarks of strategic advantage of your hubs, how do we think about strategic advantage in those markets where American is not dominant but obviously important? So just reverting back to your opening remarks of investments in Los Angeles and Chicago, what's the key to achieving strategic advantage in these more competitive markets?",pos,train
They are just major projects that we have announced and that we want to do as quick as we can which is we talked about Wi-Fi or [indiscernible] some facility projects,pos,train
"If we really adopt them in a thoughtful way, so cloud technology allows us to sort of circumvent the hosting process because it provides infrastructure ready to go",pos,train
And so we're really aggressively looking at these next generation technologies in order to work through this list of amazing ideas we have that ultimately generate value for the airline,pos,train
The effective launch of our basic economy and premium economy products in 2017 were well accepted by the marketplace and we're looking forward to expanding those products further in 2018 and beyond,pos,train
Right now we have it going down a little bit in 2020 because this just represents the transactions that we have in place today and that are firm,pos,train
What I can tell - what we're happy to talk about is Americans growth which may or may not provide some insight into what’s going on in other airlines and again maybe help or maybe not but I can talk about what we're doing,pos,train
"Really the goal around adoption of these next generation technologies is the fact to that, we have so many fantastic ideas of things that we want to achieve and frankly there are just more ideas than we have the capacity to actually get through",pos,test
"So I would expect probably from an aircraft standpoint that the 951 we have at 2018 you know probably stays pretty flat in that 940 to 950 range through 2020 and then as we see on the regional aircraft we do stay within the 600, 590 to 600 range",pos,train
So there will be some tweaks and we'll continue to update you as we move forward on each of these,pos,train
"8 billion in non-aircraft CapEx to continue the merger integration and complete projects to improve our product and operations such as narrowbody retrofit programs, the ongoing installation of premium economy on our wide-body aircraft and improvement in our clubs and new campus facilities",pos,train
"And I’m sure we’ve talked a little bit about this already, but United or others speaking out seemed that they were going to be adding capacity at a fairly rapid clip, obviously, can share it down quite a bit and so concerns of the growing industry fare war",pos,test
"That's someone else's business, but because we invest, because we do a really nice job of connecting people around the globe, we can indeed fly around our cargo and then again that business is as you noted, as we noted is picking up, anything to add Robert?",pos,train
"Based on the forward curve as of January 22, we are forecasting a 24",pos,train
In a place like you know New York where we have great assets but same thing fragmented market highly competitive important for us to be there,pos,test
"We have to be different in some ways and we've done that with things like the shuttle product, the 321Ts, having three class domestic Transcon service and then making sure that with our partner BA that we're doing the best that we can with our JFK-Heathrow franchise",pos,train
"And then the other question is, is there a shift in mix that you are seeing like on the Atlanta kind of are you seeing more, I think you said maybe more premium traffic and a shift, but can you talk about the buy up that you may be seeing from like basic economy into the forward section of the cabin?",pos,train
Our company continues to take great strides forward and the progress we've made is entirely due to their efforts,pos,train
"Whether, I mean our options are to take the A350, turn that into A330-900 or the other option is a 787-9",pos,train
So we're trying to bring those in as quick as we can and bring those in earlier,pos,train
So we've raised the CapEx in ’18 and’19 by $200 million each year for non-aircraft CapEx mainly due to those projects and facility projects and trying to get those brought in as fast as we can moving them forward,pos,train
That's the ten new Embraer 175s and then just bringing projects in earlier in ’18 and ’19 and the major - the big projects that we have on our plate that make up half of each one of those years,pos,train
"What we're doing is we're taking existing aircraft, increasing the utilization and redeploying aircraft from markets that maybe aren't doing quite as well to places where we know we can do well where we have real strategic advantage",pos,train
"Right now, we have within our flight profitability system which gives us great detail in terms of where we are making money and gives us different views as to what expenses are more fixed and flexible in the long run",pos,train
"And then I think as we've said before, we'll look at opportunities for you know application in other places",pos,train
"And so as you take a look internationally is it something that might be appropriate for transatlantic probably in a different form, but you know those are the kind of things that we think about there, but we don't have anything to announce",pos,train
"It might be not so much that example, but what happened in the old days when in a less mature business, we airlines without real network assets were looking to use the good times to build some network assets and to take out the weakest when they did that",pos,train
"No this is just that, that belly space on those aircraft are going to be flying around no matter what we do and the cool thing about the fleet renewal program is that as we take a look at 767s leaving the fleet and bringing on things like you know 787s, the capacity that comes with that is really helpful",pos,train
"So we're going to go out and [indiscernible] some airplanes and we're going to start adding service to San Francisco, Minneapolis, to Atlantic Houston, because those are really big markets, we will serve them non-stop",pos,train
That would be growth outside of our core asset base and that would in engender a certain competitive response from those carriers that do have a strategic advantage in those markets because they always do have hubs on the other in those markets,pos,train
It would be so from American's perspective going and reducing flying because oil prices went up from 50 to 70 would reduce the profits of the firm,pos,test
We also made good progress on several projects that will improve profitability and enhance the customer experience,pos,train
"Trying to put a return on invested capital on the cargo business, you know which basically assumes that capital is dedicated in the cargo businesses [indiscernible]",pos,test
It's really difficult and we certainly don’t intend to put our returns on just the cargo business,pos,train
"Growth plans, we're confident and Americans growth and very bullish prospects for American Airlines knowing everything we're going to do",pos,train
"So we're seeing benefit from that, both in the opportunity to put more cargo on the plains and at the end of the day I'm really confident that the profitability, the marginal profitability of that product is well worth being in the business",pos,train
Americans is the largest carrier there and we have the ability to continue to expand there as much as we're able to,pos,train
And over time we lose a good bit of money in those markets because we don't have local traffic and our competitors that have flow traffic filling up most of their seats and that would be not good growth for our shareholders,pos,train
"While we currently do not pay federal cash income taxes, the new law will substantially reduce the company's tax bill in the future when we do become a cash taxpayer which will be a significant benefit for all of our American stakeholders",pos,train
We're flying - we're just making our existing asset stronger and we're providing better service and better utility to customers as a result,pos,train
"Our efforts were focused on key areas that would help us earn and maintain that trust, such as improve reliability and revenue performance, service to important new markets, customer experience enhancements and improve team member relations",pos,train
"So, you know, and to be clear, you know as we discussed at Investor Day, our network assets, our privileged set of assets is our [indiscernible] system",pos,test
"So you can see it there, but we're some new cities and look there are some that get some attention and there are a little more exciting like regular [ph] Budapest and Prague, but you know the three cities that the three cities in the United States are South Bend, Missoula and Panama City",pos,test
I do believe that it's mature because we have three hub and small carriers that compete aggressively against each other that can take people all over the world with a lot of between national low cost carrier like Southwest and a lot of other competitors like the Jet Blue's and Alaska Spirits of the world intensely competitive but feeling very mature,pos,train
Sure we’re always evaluating our capital structure and work with many different banks and the like to stay very current with what’s going on in the marketplace,pos,train
"Related to those bonds, they do mature as you mentioned in December of 2020 and right now they possess a fairly sizable make whole premium that we would have to pay around about $30 million or so in that neighborhood",pos,train
As well as on the capacity constraints on the Ferris mowers side where we're going to start to see some light there of adding more capacity which can help us participate in that market growth and continue to take our market share,pos,train
"So when you look at it, it's relatively modest, but it's important and going forward we will continue to evaluate it at an annual basis to make sure we have the right mix, the right marketing mix and then the right balance between engineering and marketing along the way such that we're letting people know what was being brought to market and how things are different",pos,train
"And in terms of your CapEx plans, could you just update me on 2018 and then if you have an outlook for 2019 because I know this multiyear capacity expansion projects up in New York is definitely going to cost something",pos,train
"So, it's probably - you're probably going to be able finance most of that with cash on hand then as oppose to taking on some debt?",pos,train
The balance sheet continues to be strong to support our strategic priorities moving forward,pos,train
What I will say though is some of the regulatory fees regarding sponsors of pension plans pay have gone up quite a bit over the last couple of years and some of these actions of making the plan smaller help avoid increases related to that,pos,train
And also making the plan smaller help reduce some of the volatility that can come with changes in interest rates and other items like that which is our whole goal since the plan is frozen,pos,train
And then when you think of the other things we’re doing with working capital as well as that repatriation of some foreign cash that could all help offset interest expense as we get into our borrowing season next year,pos,test
"As we progress to the second half of fiscal 2018 and beyond, we will continue to focus on four key areas to create value",pos,train
We have begun the marketing of Infohub for commercial cutters and look forward to the opportunity to begin helping commercial cutters improve their productivity and profitability this upcoming season,pos,train
The ground logic acquisition fits squarely with this priority as a transaction gives break a leading line of products that we will be able leverage distribution to drive growth and take advantage of manufacturing synergies to optimize profitability,pos,train
"And third, we will return cash to shareholders in the form of cash dividend and stock buybacks",pos,train
"But we are seeing when we look at the order book we’re still feeling good about the fact that the season is going to materialize the way we expect, but when we see the order book from the OEMs in particular, you know we see them pushing out and filling up the channel more towards the latter half of the quarter Q3 and even into as Mark pointed out into April",pos,train
And so there is a number of different things that we've been able to do to continue to accelerate that commercial engine business beyond market growth and so we are very encouraged as we go into the second half of the year,pos,train
"And so the spend when you look at it, it will be probably skewed a little heavier of course to Q3 because we want to get it out earlier, but it will go into Q4 as well, but when you look at it, it's really - we felt that we needed to get the word out more this year than perhaps we were a little light in the past",pos,train
"So as we think about the upcoming season, the placement we have is continuing to do extremely well both within our own products group as well as with others and so we're very encouraged",pos,train
And so as we look forward into fiscal 2019 we’ll update you if we think that change is significant,pos,train
"However we will continue to analyze that just like we do with our capital structure all the time as we look forward to make sure that we got the position, the company position right to support our strategic initiatives",pos,train
So we are going to modestly increase our demand creation span which really offsets the benefit that we got from the add-on or the hurricanes,pos,train
"And so it's not a huge number but when you kind of mix it all together we got the benefit from the hurricanes, and we’re going to spend some more money on demand creation which will - it’s really a marketing investment is how we look at it to tell people about all the great stuff we have",pos,train
We spent a lot of money over the last several years on engineering and innovation and now it's time for us to add some additional dollars for demand creation,pos,test
"We had some baked in the original forecast, but as we look at our placement for the upcoming year we’re really excited about where that placement is and making sure that people are aware of the new and different things we have out there",pos,train
"So as they try to manage their inventories and then convert - alternative or conversely the retailers also manage their inventories, I mean we see inventories come down the last few years and so everybody wants to get to a little bit more of a just in time of inventory now that's not practical in this seasonal type business",pos,train
"When you look at it ongoing into the future, we will continue to have some additional marketing, but I would tell you what we will do is we are also looking at doing some relocations within engineering to have more going into marketing",pos,train
We're trying to rebalance some of that stuff because what we want to do now is we've come out with the innovation and we spent the money on the engineering,pos,train
Market information points to the potential for solid growth in single-family home sales we see this environment as an opportune time to build greater public awareness around our products and innovation and are accelerating investments and demand creation,pos,train
"However some of the rates, like the euro most notably shown a little bit more strength off late which as we start to roll particularly into next year could have some advantages",pos,train
We continue to make progress in expanding our presence in the rental channel for our Allmand jobsite products and remain cautiously optimistic for continued market growth from a rebound in oil and gas and infrastructure spending,pos,test
Well I will draw you back to our assumption that the markets for those products are going at around mid-single-digits and our goal is to grow beyond that by taking market share and so we've accomplished that as Todd has mentioned in many of the commercial areas and then the factors to consider accelerating that growth as you think forward are some of the new products like that horizontal Vanguard that is going to be significant coming on towards the end of this year,pos,train
"Yes, so far I would tell you that both related to commodities and FX we are tracking close to what we had anticipated coming into the year and a lot of that's driven by the locks we put in place in order to take some of the volatility out of that",pos,train
And then going forward as we get beyond 2018 what we commented at our Investor Day as we thought that we’d be at more at run rate of around $65 million of capital a year,pos,train
It would be via cash on hand through both our borrowing capacity and then Todd also mentioned that this year we anticipate getting some better access to cash that’s previously been overseas that we haven't been able to access as well and that’s somewhere around that $25 million mark at our Investor Day in November we commented that our current expectations were that we would have to fund about $80 million to the pension plan over the next five years,pos,train
"And so we're going to do some things that drive people to our innovation webpages, ultimately allows them to click through to some of the retailer site so that they understand what the innovations are and ultimately the benefits they will get from them",pos,test
And so on the engine side indeed we do believe that the channel inventories remain at very low levels which then provide the support for some growth and some normalization we would anticipate as we get into the back half of the year,pos,train
We also have additional placement if you will over the last few years at various commercial cutters and so others brands that are out there,pos,train
"Orders will eventually slow, while shipments will continue to increase in line with the end-market activity and the backlog will gradually reduce levels that are more normal",pos,train
Regardless of the exact sales numbers and the possible flattening of the markets the electronic content continues to grow,pos,train
"The increase in global defense spending reflects improving economic conditions around the world, coupled with a response to continuing instability in a number of key regions namely the Middle East and Asia",pos,train
So I think we are continuing to operate our strategy of increasing our portfolio in terms of new products which would allow us to continue to drive more revenue growth for the company as well as in the future years to also protect and show our margins,pos,test
"We are optimistic about our prospects over the coming quarters as we gain momentum in our strategic markets, particularly in light of the addition of the sensor and control group and the plan inclusion of the Ethertronics antenna business",pos,train
Our priority right now again is to work to improve the current margins that we need improvement on and not try to take advantage of the market situation and arbitrarily just raise prices up,pos,train
The planned Ethertronics antenna technology acquisition our latest announcement is scheduled to close soon and is another key opportunity for AVX to become a leader in this wireless connectivity space,pos,train
"Here again, what we will do is upon announcing the close of the transaction, as we indicated now, now anticipated for the 31st, we will provide updated guidance to include the FCX and the packs on both the fiscal 2018 and any update in terms of our forward thoughts around the business",pos,train
"But no changes, and we continue to work through the integration planning efforts in terms of our view on what that business will add in the next 12 months",pos,train
"And so, going forward, team has got the right line of sight, and we know we have opportunities around point of sale, reducing variation and customer groups and across product types and we believe continued growth, customer mix can help us also product mix can help us as we go through in that, so that what we would say, it is the right goal, it is the right objective for us to have",pos,test
"We expect as we continue to see and look across the next couple of quarters, continued productivity, probably here it gets the tougher comps, selling out in a kind of mid-teens increase year-over-year for the back half of the year, which is good drive within the oil and gas focused service centers, a full year increase of about 20% to 25% year-over-year sales growth",pos,train
"At 95 years, Applied is well-positioned as the technical MRO distribution leader, and we're committed to generating profitable growth and enhancing value for all our stakeholders",pos,train
"So, I think about it going forward, I think there is a good potential that it's going to be higher than 20 number as we think about future quarters",pos,train
"Overall, we’re off to an exciting start to the calendar year and our fiscal year second-half, celebrating 95 years of leadership and industrial distribution, and further strengthening our position with the definitive agreement to acquire specialty flow control provider FCX performance Incorporated",pos,train
"So, continue to hoarder on there on that front end expect to drive your benefit as we move forward as we work these consistent processes, utilize some of the new tools to drive efficiencies and the collections activities",pos,train
"Following the culmination of the FCX Performance transaction and borrowing to fund the acquisition, our capital allocation priorities will focus on delevering and continuing to deliver shareholder value by maintaining our track record of consistent dividend payments and increases",pos,train
"The only thing I would add to that, Michael, is just reemphasize that really our approach is a blended one considering pipeline additions and larger opportunities as Jeff said where the strategy and science makes sense and where we really feel that Biogen can track the maximum value",pos,train
We benchmarked against multiple businesses to challenge ourselves to be as effective and efficient as possible as we aim to create an innovative operating model designed for the future,pos,train
We believe this will enable us to redirect up to $400 million by the end of 2020 to be reinvested and prioritize value creating opportunities across our R&D and commercial organizations,pos,train
As Mike said so the priority is certainly on the better tolerability profile,pos,train
So we will be able to expand the big franchise there,pos,train
", Europe and Japan, we believe there is significant opportunity if the trial is successful",pos,train
We have an energized world-class executive team and key opportunities in front of us based on the significant unmet medical needs and breakthroughs we are seeing in neuroscience,pos,train
"Looking forward to leading the next 12 months to 18 months where we have several meaningful readouts across our neuroscience pipeline including natalizumab stroke BIIB098 in MS, BIIB054 in Parkinson’s disease, BIIB074 for painful lumbosacral radiculopath, BAN2401 in Alzheimer's disease, BIIB067 for ALS and our gene therapy program for XLRS",pos,train
"So, science will be the key driver, the ability to create value that nobody else will be able and alignment to the strategies that we brought in",pos,train
So there is a lot more refinements just in the execution of these trials and the other thing is that we are looking at this with eyes wide open and the totality of our action one and action two studies,pos,test
"growth in 2018, is that going to be a function of existing geographies, putting more patients on the drug or will be driven by more newer territories coming online and when you think about SPINRAZA kind of big picture, could this be a franchise similar to other orphan franchises where maybe as much as two-thirds of the total peak revenue is outside the U",pos,train
"I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations and beliefs",pos,train
"So, this is a trend that we need to get used to even if we work at helping the provider community to dose better with devices etcetera",pos,train
SPINRAZA units were dispensed to our free drug program highlighting our goal that no patient will forego treatment because of financial limitation or an insurance denial in the U,pos,train
"As we develop and expand the Biogen pipeline, our aim is to increase overall productivity at every stage, de-risk the pipeline and continue to implement a robust external pipeline strategy that may include continued asset acquisitions, development partnerships for resource flexibility and risk sharing and early innovation partnerships",pos,train
"So that is happening and we expect that to happen into next year, it’s kind of hard to do the math real-time on your numbers, but we can certainly take that offline",pos,train
"I think European team has done a really good job and they are poised to kind of do even better in 2018, as we look at the countries, we have got – countries kind of lined up and we expect increased growth from the existing countries as well new countries coming on",pos,train
The goal of these priorities is to drive significant cash flow generation and invest those to create new sources of value beyond MS and SMA,pos,train
We are excited to have you on the team and I am glad to see that you are quickly coming up to speed on the business,pos,train
"When I spoke from the SIT a year ago, I told you we are refocusing the organization, building our new management team and developing a strategy and priorities for both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation",pos,train
"And finally, our fifth strategic priority reprioritizing our capital allocation towards long-term growth, while also continuing to opportunistically buyback shares",pos,train
And importantly in terms of strategic alliances we renegotiated our agreements with Eisai and Neurimmune with the aim to improve long-term economics of aducanumab,pos,train
"In addition to the strong progress in 2017, I am also excited by new additions to our executive team",pos,train
And as we looked out through next year and there on I think that business is well-positioned,pos,train
And then we continue to look at it strategically in terms of what would fit with our core operations going forward,pos,train
"And I think our focus is on that – is on growing the business continuing to be active in early stage, but also hopefully being active in mid to late stage assets to bring in things that are closer to revenue",pos,train
"Having said that, we also expect to be able to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchase, I think we have ample flexibility for that, but we will be disciplined and we will look for those opportunities that fit strategically, scientifically, that fit with the operations and fit in our core areas",pos,train
", we expect to continue to see pretty good growth in unit volume across most of the major European countries",pos,test
We believe that Biogen has a competitive advantage in this space based on our strong track record and intense focus within our core growth areas and emerging growth areas within neuroscience,pos,train
"Our goal is to leverage our competitive advantage, target our investments and advance the world-class neuroscience R&D engine",pos,test
"And we think there is good growth in that, so we're just continuing to grow penetration in each of those of the markets too",pos,train
And we launched a similar pricing structure and began rolling out our loyalty program whilst also improving frontline service delivery with an all new content center experience in Berlin,pos,train
And we intend to make these upgrades in major part - major moment [ph] for our business in Germany and Austria and we believe they can be a big part of the next phase of growth for us,pos,train
"If Fox were to drop its offer would Disney need to wait six months to make an offer or because it's a technically different parent would that six month period be waived? And then just on the actual business, you've discussed offering the TV service over broadband in Italy and Austria",pos,train
"We continue to be in a strong financial position, with good liquidity, a long and diverse set of debt maturities and no pension deficit",pos,train
Our core focus therefore continues to be on how we improve our performance in each of these areas of the customer experience,pos,train
"We think Sky Q is a big opportunity for us, and so we going to take it into more markets",pos,train
"And that requires us to do two things, so first, excel at delivering a winning proposition today, but then alongside that build for the future, both developing additional services for customers to make that sky experience even better and then to open up new markets, so we can grow into, which will provide further opportunities for the business",pos,train
"No, I think the beauty of what we are actually doing in migrating to a single platform is actually taking cost out, because we can essentially raise once and deploy anywhere, and you'll start seeing that with co-platforms we've got",pos,test
NTV will join our channel line up next week and we'll launch the service on more large screen devices to extend our range,pos,train
"Than moving to innovation of products and services, our aim here is to make the Sky experience better for all customers, providing them with greater value for money, but also to make it easier for more people to get Sky on their terms",pos,train
"Second, it clearly what we are doing, if you look how we gone into Switzerland and Spain, beyond our core traditional territories, are potential executions from which amongst other things we will test and learn, strategies for market entry potentially organically and potentially in other European markets",pos,train
"We delivered our original 200 million synergy target early and we upped our 2020 goal to GBP400 million, which we're well on track for",pos,train
So that means we'll be able to rollout innovation across each of our markets at greater pace and more efficiently,pos,train
"Well Monika we will take it one fiscal year at a time, you know we were comfortable with the guidance of one to two, you know let's get to the end of fiscal year 2018 and then we will talk about '19 but we have a pipeline that is growing, the number of pilot we are getting commitment on from customers is also increasing and we are also hearing good things from customers about our competitiveness vis-à-vis the other companies out there",pos,train
"In the context of the comments that I made about the top tier E&C looking for new sources of revenue generation, they see the APM suite as a potential set of products and tools that they can then held deploy for this customer or help monitor once they are implemented, so in a way they are used either - they think of APM suite as a way to provide consulting or implementation services for those products and eventually monitoring of the assets that are under the Mtell as super vision",pos,train
"Look, it moved up again as a percentage of our total pipeline, our total pipeline also improved and it’s in that 24% to 25% of our total pipeline, certainly we monitor that pipeline, but I think more importantly an indicator of our ability to turn the pipeline into transactions is a number of pilots that we are performing or that we perform with our customers to prove out the efficacy of the technology and the number of pilots that we are performing and we are that are committed to be perform continues to increase",pos,train
"So the two most common competitors of that we are seen in the marketplace are GE, but the fact is that GE solution is not predicted, maintenance is condition based monitoring and we tend to do very well against them, Schneider is also the second Company that we see out there often",pos,test
"So I think overall we are confident we have a business that can deliver value for customers, deliver value for AspenTech and is a total wide space addressable market and that should provide a platform to better and faster growth in the future",pos,train
There solutions seems to be a combination of condition based monitoring with some predicted capability and then once in while we are seeing couple of all the companies SAS and Company called C3 IOT as well,pos,train
Our profitability drives high levels of cash flow which combined with our strong balance sheet enables us to consistently generate shareholder value through share repurchases,pos,train
"At the same time I do think that there are extreme businesses of these customers are still been managed in a very disciplined and cautious manner, oil supply is still exceeding demand, although its more imbalanced in the last six months, so I would expect a spend environment in the upstream sector and E&Cs that is still very cautious and measured",pos,train
We believe the overall increase in CapEx budgets from international oil companies and shale oil focused companies will be in the mid to high-single digits,pos,train
"We also signed transactions for Mtell in the oil and gas, metals and mining and building materials industries and signed transactions for our multi varied analytics try and do in the polymers and food industries",pos,train
"On the chemical it seems like based on what China is doing on environmental side, it seems like there might be a little bit more CapEx spend coming in 2019, 2020 timeframe, can you help add some color on how that CapEx and that is going to go for the chemical side",pos,test
We will continue to monitor our momentum and success as the fiscal year progress enabled with the opportunity for greater investment in our customer facing organizations of the APM business going forward,pos,train
"Look as you can expect based on what you know about AspenTech, our engineering business certainly has a strong headwinds and we are able to overcome those headwinds to deliver positive growth out of the engineering suite, but that growth is mitigated by those headwinds",pos,test
"I said in my remarks that depending on the outlook that we see for the APM business in Q3, Q4 we could decide to take advantage of that opportunity and put some more investment in the APM business as a priority",pos,train
These customers continue to operate in a favorable demand environment for their products while they remain focused on improving operations and driving cost efficiencies,pos,train
We continue to execute well against our asset optimization strategy and remain confident in our ability to benefit from our large and growing market opportunity,pos,train
"But it’s mostly new opportunities that are being identified in the marketplace, so that's what it is",pos,train
"While there will be variability quarter-to-quarter, we would anticipate that all three products suites will be represented in our largest quarterly transactions going forward",pos,train
And eventually we would expect that there is more wide spread adoption as customer can get more comfortable with the technology as the values through that and they understand what they can do for them,pos,train
"Now overtime you can see the synergies between the APM suite, the MSC suite and the engineering suite, I think certainly that deal with our E&C Company is perhaps an early indicator of that, but from an operational standpoint, we have already have used cases where we see the synergy and the value creation from combining some of the APM technologies with MSC technologies, so we will have to some work in the products to achieve those synergies, but overtime I know that we would see the benefit from that",pos,train
"They sighted Mtell’s ability to improve reliabilities that positively impacts a wide range of issues from reducing its current maintenance costs, to planning for abnormal process conditions, avoiding emergency or unplanned shutdowns and successfully managing unpredictable feed and demands",pos,test
as well as the places because the demand will be there to sustain it in the long-term,pos,train
But we also note that it will be the long-term oil supply demand balance that will signal to energy companies the opportunities to sustain higher levels of CapEx investment in new sources of oil production,pos,train
"Let me start with where we are focused today, it's natural for us to be focused on our process industry customers refining and chemicals because that's where our sales organization is going to market every day, so we would expect that the initial set of deals and transactions for APM would be out of that customer set, which I think informs and the first part of your question the initial set of transactions that were assigned in the quarter where in the refining sector there were a few in chemicals and there was also an oil and gas one related to pipeline monitoring application for Mtell, but as we look at our pipeline of deals we do see transactions in our pipeline that are in the upstream sector as well where we think APM can truly make a difference for those customers",pos,train
We are making good progress in investing across our product and go-to market organizations to support our asset optimization strategy and the APN suite,pos,test
Two examples of investments we are making in the business include the release of Aspen version 10,pos,train
We believe our ability to invest for future growth while maintaining best-in-class levels of profitability is a unique differentiator for AspenTech,pos,train
"Specifically Cipher will capture condition and analyze data on the edge, on the edge of assets from sensors and other data sources that can be used with our machine learning and analytics solutions to increase asset efficiency and uptime",pos,train
"Second, these global E&C firm and long time AspenTech customer renewed its agreement and licensed our APN suite to expand access to and build on experience with the Fidelis reliability product",pos,train
Whether is a bit more growth coming out of some of these next generation cloud companies and maybe a little bit less coming out of the more traditional OEMs that building the boxes,pos,train
"Just once again as I come out of the fourth quarter, I am just so proud of our team, our results this quarter once again reflects the true value of the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst what is always a very dynamic electronics industry all well driving outstanding operating performance for the quarter",pos,train
We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from successful automotive business into the future,pos,test
I would say that automotive is much more a content growth story of electronics applications continuing to expand in the car,pos,train
And the includes everything from hybrids and electric drive train to next generation emission control to onboard electronics to even kind of autonomous liked application that are going into cars and again creating just great new functionality into demand for new electronic systems which ultimately create a really nice opportunity for our team to work with customers to design in our next generation product,pos,train
"As we benefited from robust organic growth across really nearly every segment of the industrial market but driven especially by strength in heavy equipment, oil and gas, alternative energy and instrumentation",pos,train
I believe that we'll continue to have a very strong position but what volumes ultimately will be and how new platforms ultimately gets designed that's always very difficult to predict in this market,pos,train
I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these new record levels of revenues and earnings and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position while expanding our profitability,pos,train
"Through both our successful execution program as well as our organic innovation, we've developed a very broad range of product across a diversified array of exciting segments within the global and industrial market",pos,train
"We believe the ability to more freely move earnings under the new territorial system will provide additional support for the company's long-term capital allocation strategy which focuses on achieving a balance between organic business development, acquisition growth and shareholder returns including dividend and share buyback",pos,train
"We believe the ability to more freely move the company's earnings under this new territorial system will provide additional support for our consistent, long-term capital allocation strategy, which focuses on achieving a balance between investing in organic business development, acquisition growth and delivering shareholder returns including our dividends and share buyback program",pos,train
"I wouldn't say that there is in particular one or another geography that sticks out, I think what we see in the mobile networks market is that -- is the dynamic that we have seen many times before when you have both generational changes as well as various corporate goings and coming across the industry which is that -- there is a little bit of a pause and that is the pause that we saw this year",pos,train
If there is ever an acceleration overall in the plans about various operators or pulling forward in the plans of when to ultimately install next generation network,pos,test
"Well, I can assure you is our team has just done fabulous job of making sure that we are broadly positioned in all geographies",pos,train
We really think balance flexibility and consistency are really the cornerstone of our strategy and we do think the Tax Act really helps with that and supporting that and the ability to more freely move cash as myself and Adam mentioned in our prepared remarks really additionally supports that as well,pos,train
"I believe very much that one should pay reasonable prices for acquisition regardless of what the cost of capital of the moment is because when we make these acquisitions, we are acquiring them for life",pos,train
We are very happy to pay good prices for great companies and we are going to continue to take that same approach,pos,train
We have still many more companies that we pursue and follow and stay in touch with and have it various stages of the life of an acquisition if you will,pos,train
"And if we can fit -- if we can check those three boxes very importantly, whether that is a big company or small company we are going to put our best effort forward in terms of bringing that into the Amphenol family",pos,train
And we are going to continue to deploy that capital which as we said has a more flexible availability to it than it had in the past and I am very confident long term we will have great success,pos,train
"However, we remain ever aware that this market will inevitably perform in unexpected ways and we'll just continue to reminder ourselves that the key to our success is the proven ability of our team to meet and capitalize on any expected opportunities and challenges that arise in this dynamic market",pos,train
Our team working in this important market is continues to solidify our leadership position by leveraging our leading technology position amid the more favorable military expanding environment,pos,train
"So as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remained very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company",pos,test
Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains the core competitive advantage for the company,pos,train
"144 billion and $921 million respectively and we continue to put that cash to work in our acquisition program, which once again contributed strongly to our performance here in 2017",pos,train
"Well, I think relative to supply chain, number one is our team just done a fabulous job and are there certain constraint, we certainly hear about the passes and discrete and some ICs, I wouldn't say that in our company and our universe and our industry we have seen those broad based constraints",pos,test
We are continuing to benefit from our long term and consistent strategy in the automotive market of expanding range of interconnect sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisition to enable wide array of onboard electronic across the diversified range of vehicle made by auto manufactures around the world,pos,test
It seems like the outlook in industrial and auto sort of those industrial focused market continues to be very strong,pos,train
We are as helpful as anybody and things like US tax reform or stimuli or overall economic growth around the world can ultimately drive things like infrastructure spending or investments in network or whatever that maybe that can ultimately have a favorable effect on demand for our product,pos,train
I think we continue to have a great management team that does a really great job of making sure that their cost in the business are as low as possible given and as flexible as possible in regard to their everyday operation,pos,train
I think this is an area that we believe that long term we should be able to continue to have that leverage,pos,train
And in the shorter term the acquisition that are having some impact which we would expect as we acquire companies that are at lower profitability will have some impact in the future and until we are able to get them up to the Amphenol operating level which we do believe as the management team is clearly possible and certainly targeted,pos,train
"I will say that as you migrate towards a service provider in terms of their proportion of the market, service providers buy in a very different cadence than do equipment manufacture",pos,train
I mean another thing that actually does have a little bit of impact in the short term but over time we would expect to improve upon it is the impact of our acquisitions that have been done recently over the course of the year,pos,train
"As you recall, we closed on the acquisitions earlier this year of Phitek,i2S, Telect, the 3 sensor businesses of Meggitt and then Sunpool in the fourth quarter and CTI here in January",pos,train
"While the overall market environment in 2017 was certainly very dynamic as we enter 2018 our agile entrepreneurial management team is highly confident that we've built a platform strength from which we can drive superior, long-term performance",pos,train
"Sunpool which is based in the industrial center of North East China is a leader in the Chinese automotive antenna market leveraging its advanced product design strength, together with outstanding vertically integrated and low cost manufacturing capabilities",pos,train
"The company represents another great compliment to both our broad and diversified antenna offering around the world, as well as the great compliment to our growing presence in the Chinese automotive market",pos,train
"CTI Industries which we closed on early here in January is a Canada based manufacture of high technology cable assemblies for a wide array of applications including embedded computing, industrial and automotive",pos,train
"I think of you are a potential seller, it’s a little early for you to be able to understand how that’s going to impact valuation if you are an interested acquirer and I would put us in that category, I think you’ve got two things going forward",pos,train
"As our investors know, wealth management is a business that we’ve been committed to for nearly a century with a broad cross-section of products and services including institutional and personal wealth management, trust services for individuals, corporations, and institutions, private banking services, retail and institutional brokerage, investment banking and financial risk management among others",pos,train
"You can get caught up in one quarter or two quarters, but the activity is going on that underlies that is very strong and we would expect those markets to continue to be a growth driver for us as we move forward, just relatively – because we have a relatively small market share in those markets",pos,train
We pay a very good dividend and we’ll continue to pay in the kind of range that you’ve seen in the past in terms of a percent of earnings and then we will be opportunistic on stock buybacks where we can,pos,test
"I think, as you know, because of the nature and size of energy lending, it tends to be a larger lending group typically meets the definition of a shared national credit",pos,train
We reversed $7 million of loan loss reserve in the fourth quarter as we are seeing no signs of weakness from a credit standpoint and meaningful declines of both non-accrual loan and potential problem loan balances,pos,train
"We are well below that and all of our forecast would indicate that we have effectively the capacity to grow certainly through 2018 and likely through a big chunk of 2019 based on our projections for the loan portfolio, capital growth, et cetera as we move forward",pos,train
This is inclusive of the fee income lines that investors see on our corporate income statement,pos,train
"We continue believe those should drive growth for us as we move forward in 2018, 2019 and beyond",pos,train
"So it’s, we’ve got the cash flows scheduled out really regardless of what rates do, we are going to have pretty significant cash flows that we can reinvest",pos,train
"Obviously, we have a deep history in energy and so, how we handle the downturn is, kind of a dividend that we are receiving today because we are exceeding, we are receiving numerous opportunities to lead deals and that’s an opportunity we are absolutely taking advantage of",pos,train
"In addition, energy customers tend to be some of – our most complete relationship using the other fee-generating products and services we offer, which makes the – returns in this business very attractive",pos,train
"We are going to say, look, it goes into the capital pool and we are going to allocate it primarily towards organic growth going forward",pos,train
"So, yes, it’s always an assessment of the share price, the proceeds, the funds we have and what’s lying ahead and what makes sense more to do, but, yes, we will be active",pos,test
"We attribute this mainly to network transformation project in all-IP in North America and West Europe understanding that the trends of network transformation is supposed to pick up in coming years, we do not expect any material adverse change in sales of Gateways in 2018",pos,test
"One, one of our key competitors Ribbon Communication is focusing substantially more on service providers",pos,train
We believe that we will position until our businesses become more productive simply because we can capitalize on a very large global installed base of enterprise partners and customers where we deployed SBCs and gateways and endpoints,pos,train
"So we believe this is going to be a step staged process, where more countries will enter that",pos,train
Just accumulating the calls and creating the large infrastructure that would allow you when you go to operate these AI technologies you’ll be ready to do so,pos,train
"UC-SIP which represents about 45% of revenues, the main business that attracts most of our investments since 2009 continues to grow as planned",pos,train
"The new unit is intended to leverage on our existing technologies in certain areas such as speech recognition and call recording, and add to it, artificial intelligences and machine learning technologies in order to enhance productivity and to be able to deliver actionable impacts from business to voice communication",pos,train
"Second half of the year we won a large multimillion dollar RFP for gateways to support the migration to all-IP with one of the world leading service provider operating in many countries, and we believe that the potential of this win will start to unfold over the next several years",pos,train
"In terms of our global activity, in North America we believe that almost all of the access partner supporting Microsoft Skype for Business and Teams are aligned with AudioCodes",pos,train
"Cash flow, I have mentioned, very strong that allows us to be very activity on our buyback and I think you’ve seen part of the return on investments coming from that process",pos,train
"We’ve done a very large with a larger national airline in Latin America, also we have own a very big project within American multinational office supply retail chain, which has over 1,000 stores in North America",pos,train
"Growth in UC-SIP is driven primarily by our success in the Enterprise Voice space, gradually become sub-vendor for delivering voice connectivity and infrastructure for market segments such as the unified communications market and contact center markets",pos,train
"These risks, uncertainties and factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of current global economic conditions and conditions in general and in AudioCodes industry and target markets, in particular, shifts in supply and demand, market acceptance of new products and the demand for existing products, the impact of competitive products and pricing on AudioCodes and its customers, products and markets, timely product and technology developments, upgrade and the ability to manage changes in market conditions as needed, possible need for additional financing, the ability to satisfy covenants in the company’s loan agreements, possible disruptions from acquisitions, the ability of AudioCodes to successfully integrate the products and operations from acquired companies into AudioCodes business and other factors detailed in AudioCodes filings with the SEC, the U",pos,train
"While we make these investments, we will continue to balance our disciplined expense management philosophy with a strong focus on driving revenue growth as we continue to make progress toward our goal of being Midwest Premier Community Bank",pos,train
"We believe that our combination of market focus, balance sheet strength, talent and convenience provides a compelling choice to consumers and businesses alike",pos,train
So that $2 million plus range we hope is a sustainable level for us going forward,pos,train
And we believe we are well positioned to achieve additional competitive and market share gains as we move forward,pos,train
"So I think most analysts in their models are assuming some modest pressure over the course of the year, I think that's a reasonable conservative baseline, but of course we're going to try our best to beat that expectation",pos,train
"Well, we are doing some hiring within the mortgage banking area as well",pos,train
"And again mortgage loan officers that we hired we hope they pay for themselves very quickly, because for the most part their compensations is commission based",pos,train
And the hiring that we are doing we think pays for itself fairly quickly and creates very good momentum going into 2019,pos,train
We believe we are well positioned to expand our market share in our high growth geographies and continue our focus on those services and product lines that provide the greatest opportunity to create value,pos,train
"I would anticipate another 10 that we have in the next two quarters, that really should add out very nicely",pos,train
"It's our goal of really growing in our core markets of Detroit, Grand Rapids and Cleveland where we feel the growth opportunities are",pos,train
"Yes, so I - we worked very hard to create a Chemical Bank, we worked on a number of initiatives to make sure that there is consistency of understanding of our mission vision values the intent of the organization how we take care of our team members and focus on our marketplaces",pos,train
So today five quarters out I would say that we are one Chemical Bank,pos,train
So there may be some upside on that accredible yield as if that credit performance continues to be very strong,pos,train
"So for deposits, deposits going forward, that is a key focus of ours, we have - estimating a couple of deposit generation programs, the goal is core deposits and continuing to attract stable relationships that require a premium, that's really where we're focused and we think we can achieve that goal",pos,train
We continue to execute our strategy as we take steps toward reaching our goal of being Midwest Premier Community Bank,pos,train
"The areas that we expect to be growing we are and - but I don't know the percentage we can get that, but it's a larger percent than the rest of the company just because of the scale of the marketplace",pos,train
"And then the balance of it, we expect it to all occur in the fourth quarter of this year",pos,train
"And then - so, I mean, loan growth is going to be a key area that will be visible where we'll see the benefits of the investment",pos,train
"The investments we are making will increase our operating expense run rate going forward, but more importantly will enhance our overall long-term growth prospects",pos,train
"Yes, we're still - if we add incremental leverage our goal is to have a minimum of 1",pos,train
Let me conclude by saying the economies in the markets we serve continue to show favorable improvement and we are optimistic of the benefits that we'll receive following the enhancement of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,pos,train
Even so we continue to retain our focus on what we can control,pos,train
"Jude, but frankly as you can see in the numbers, there’s growth here and there’s going to be growth here, and it’s not just small incremental growth",pos,train
Our focus is to continue enhancing our competitiveness and to capitalize on future growth opportunities in this market,pos,train
"I know it’s very early, but can you help us think through what you’re seeing initially and what you expect to see over the next couple of quarters in the pediatric China market, and also an update on nutritional pricing in the U",pos,train
"So you know, I think our challenges are how to keep the pedal down on that growth, because all of these businesses have opportunities at the same time and some of it is some fairly significant scale-up, and Libre is a tremendous opportunity",pos,train
"That’s an interesting challenge for us, it’s a positive challenge, it’s a good challenge, and fortunately we’ve got such strong cash flow, we can afford the capital investment that we want to spend while we’re paying down our debt and paying our dividend and so forth",pos,train
"We know we have some innovations coming and we’re seeing sequential improvement even here in the fourth quarter ’17, and we want to continue to sustain that momentum and compete on share and market expansion on the adult, because we just typically hadn’t relied on price in the U",pos,train
"I think the team’s done a terrific job in the ped market, and we remain the clear leader in that market",pos,train
"So as we came out of the fourth quarter, the growth rate of that product is just tremendous and we’ve got a series of enhancements and approvals and additions to it coming that only make it better",pos,train
"Though this business was very successful for us, we didn’t see a path that would move us into a broader leadership position across the larger vision care market, so we sold the business to J&J who is already in that position, which allowed us to focus on other priorities and growth opportunities",pos,train
"So I go into ’18, I look at the numbers that we forecasted, and yes, I feel pretty confident about it, so at this point I’m looking at the success we’re having with cash flow and the balance sheet, investment in expansion, investment in capacities, investments in R&D and SG&A, which I put more money into, and everything looks pretty good",pos,train
"So I expect Alere to emerge, I’m going to say over two to three years, because we want to put more investment into new products, refreshing products, R&D, SG&A, etc",pos,train
"in particular, and you can see that in a lot of the things that companies are communicating, and the same is going to be true for us",pos,train
"What areas would you point us to where things aren’t going well, that you want to improve, and how do you think about dropping all this good growth on the top line through to the bottom line versus investing in all the things that you have to invest in now?",pos,train
"Obviously we hedge some of it to protect the stability of earnings, but you can’t hedge it all, so if we are favorable, yes, you’ll probably see it",pos,train
We will spend some of that money investing in manufacturing in the United States as it’s predicted that that would happen,pos,train
"But we are directing a fair amount of this to help ensure we’ve got not only a sustainable product pipeline and rapid innovation and enhancements to products, but that we’re also doing our best in marketing areas and so forth to maximize the opportunity that’s in front of us as rapidly as we can",pos,train
You’re also getting access to previously trapped cash in your global cash flows going forward,pos,train
"If rates hold and things pan and history is an indicator, it’s similar to last year, we may see some of those flow through; but I think it’s just too early",pos,train
"So as I’ve said, we’re going to make a priority out of getting that cash or getting that debt down to a more balanced level",pos,train
"So sometimes I think we’re going to see some of these quarters look very up, and other times they’re going to be a little less up, but they’re always up",pos,train
"Over the past several months, we’ve launched a number of products that will increase our competitiveness, open new markets and contribute to growth in 2018 and beyond",pos,train
"I mean, that’s all going to be true, but I think operationally it’s going to take a little longer to get this back on an investment cycle in products and launches and so forth that we’ll want to see",pos,train
"When you’ve got these kinds of opportunities, you’ve got to invest in them and put fuel behind them, and fortunately tax reform has given us that ability",pos,train
"Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016",pos,test
"Also, a key element of our long-term success has been our ability to proactively shape our company to ensure we’re in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for growth",pos,train
"To Miles’ point, there’s a lot of strong fundamentals in those markets that would point towards growth going forward",pos,train
"It starts that way initially - it starts as a slow roll, and then it’s going to pick up tremendous momentum because it’s our intent to replace that entire base and frankly take a lot of share with it",pos,train
"So I think our capital allocation, our cash flow is strong, we’re pushing down the debt fast, faster than we anticipated by at least 18 months, so all of that right now is frankly looking quite good, largely due to the tax reform and the management of cash flow here",pos,train
"So, I think that’s the thought process that when we look at the ramp and the activity in the funnel that we are taking some confidence in as we look towards the back half of the year and with specifically kind of a focus on Q4",pos,train
And I would expect that generally from a directional standpoint we’ll continue to see that going forward,pos,train
"But we believe we have the potential to expand our geographic momentum during the second half of this year and expect that by our fiscal fourth quarter, based on some of our recent restructuring and resource additions, our US business will be a larger contributor to overall order momentum",pos,train
"Accuray’s ability to be a viable competitor in the single and dual vault settings which are mainly community and regional hospital camps represents an additional 2,000 plus vaults that we now have potential access to in the US market alone",pos,train
One would be going to the convert holders directly to negotiate a payment in cash rather than shares which is one of the reasons we raised our cash in December 2017,pos,train
"And the other could be to mitigate the shares issued in the open market, some type of stock repurchase equal to the stock that’s issued",pos,train
"Our goal still remains the same, which is to minimize the amount of dilution that’s going to out in the market after February 1st",pos,train
Our cash balances include the cash we raised in December 2017 through a combination of a new term loan and an amendment to the existing revolver facility,pos,train
"But 606 could give us an opportunity, because valuate other criteria in our backlog for example the 30 months age-out criteria is something we're continuing to evaluate if that's the right benchmark",pos,train
The focus here is to find a partner that would be both a manufacturing entity or an assembly provider if you will or partner as well as someone who has competency in the regulatory approval process for us to enable an essentially a local ethnic Chinese branded product solution,pos,train
sales territory coverage model to optimize standard control and to drive improved focus on our best targeted account opportunities,pos,train
"We continue to believe many of these orders will still go to revenue in age-in, as we have seen happen in previous quarters",pos,train
"Radixact sets up nicely quite frankly as a catalyst to be able to trade in trade up, our existing install based Tomo customers to the next generation platform in order for them to be able to put themselves into Q4, the upgrade pathway for motion compensation, improved imaging capability that are going to need to be operating loss of a Radixact based platform in order to upgrade to those product functional capabilities",pos,train
"So, it really serves as a catalyst quite frankly to move the trade and trade up discussion forward",pos,train
Do you need to see the number of quarters in a row or is it -- just curious in terms of what you are tracking in order to have that confidence level in the new dynamic that you are seeing in the last two quarters?,pos,train
"However, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we’re working over the next few weeks on various strategies to minimize that dilution and there’s some very obvious kind of scenarios that could come to mind",pos,train
We are expecting and we are anticipating they be our public fund levels will go down over time,pos,train
"But again there’s a question as Carlos say slow in stocks, some of these money goes out comes in, some of this money is restricted but we are projecting these funds will go down overtime, we are anticipating that",pos,test
So there is still - we were encourage but I mean these are trend that we need to continue to follow very closely,pos,train
"That been said, through the fourth quarter, two third of our mortgage borrowers can be used to make payment similar to October",pos,test
"I have another question somewhat related, I think you said a number something like $25 billion plus of insurance play money that could flow down to the Island, I’ve heard similar estimates on elsewhere, I am just wondering, would it crazy lead to say that if you are guys are banking 67% of Puerto Rico that you should see a proportion amount of those deposits flow through deep balance sheet over the next 12, 18, two years?",pos,train
"I’ll let Carlos to go in detail but I don’t in general I mean most people have said stress testing is here to stay that we may have more flexibility in how we do it, we won’t have to necessarily follow the models that the fed gives us and we may have",pos,train
"We will continue to pursue selective loan portfolio purchases on the Island, with attractive opportunities become available",pos,train
"So I think those are you know I don’t want to tell people that the numbers are, I don’t want to diminish the issue migration definitely has accelerated, I just saying there are some crazy numbers were being turnaround, some very hard numbers and I think we have to wait to get better numbers from the Census Bureau, I think we’re going to get better numbers from school enrollment both in Puerto Rico and in Florida for example, those are numbers that will give us a better a better more real look at the number",pos,train
The pace of economic recovery will be heavily dependent on the speed of the remaining power restoration and the magnitude in timing of funds flowing into Puerto Rico from federal agencies and insurance companies,pos,train
I think we feel comfortable with the levels that we have it today but certainly portfolio that we will continue to watch given the situation of medallions in New York City,pos,train
The foundation’s focus in funding projects that is focus in funding projects that will help stabilize communities such as providing access to clean water and installing solar energy panels,pos,train
"I mean we have seen clients started to obviously to pay again but mortgage is a little bit more complex because every program is different, they have to come in and decide which option they are going to take to solve the three months that they didn’t pay",pos,train
"The most of it is 12 billion, the majority will be electronic, still like to coming out and there is trust in handing out cash, so that should be good for the electronics payments mechanisms?",pos,train
"So, again, we said 25 billion federal funds and insurance, which is a pretty conservative number because as we said some people have estimated insurance might be 10 to 20 by itself",pos,train
"I mean you know we are the dominate player in Puerto Rico, so in terms of deposit share, so we can expect that we will get a far fair share of any despite",pos,train
"On the fee income waiving deposit service charges in kind of the slower money management income, is the moratorium on waiving fee income also over and are those lines expected to kind of return back to normal within the next couple of quarters?",pos,train
"That there are some tax reasons to include treasuries as well given that right example for Puerto Rico entities, so there is an after tax consideration and the purchase, a mix of treasuries mortgage loan securities which is the other asset partner we usually use for the portfolio",pos,train
"And with regards to the comment, yes we continue to be sensitive, so it's - if price go up, we like it",pos,train
"Wanted to first ask, are you guys pretty excited about the proper news yesterday is that, give you guys some hope that they’ll be able to do some improvement on the cost of electricity and the infrastructure on the Island?",pos,train
The trends are encouraging but currently managed some sectors like auto and personal loan have recovered faster than others such as mortgage,pos,train
Many other clients’ mortgage will require formal modifications for their loan to become official current again and verification will in many cases will may take months to process and do the paper work and everything else,pos,train
"So in the case of mortgage, as Lidio mentioned earlier, it will take us some time to get a real reading on titles of where clients are",pos,test
"So in that front when you compare delinquencies January 2018 January 2017, the reality even through going to be comparing apples-to-apples as we have done with the consumer portfolio",pos,train
"The loans that got pulled back on to the balance sheet GNMA loans, did you have to take a reserve associate with those?",pos,train
"With much of the client in the hospitality sector, jobs we expect to return once larger tourist hotels we open later in the year",pos,test
"Projects such as a new online lending platform and there are E-LOAN brand, and wide level credit card offering in the U",pos,train
I think the best think we can say at this point in time it seems that most are consumer portfolios are trending to getting normalized and then may be some version of that will happen in the mortgage as well but again mortgage will take time to play out,pos,train
"There’s two things, first of all, the Internet obviously shows the non-local transaction but even some very large retailers in Puerto Rico as well there are merchants system is run out of their headquarters in the states, so even other purchase may have happened here in Puerto Rico physically, it may show up through in a non-Puerto Rico report",pos,train
"You know, we - I don’t think we have to breakdown the insurance inflows but I can definitely say that most of the increase in the fourth quarter was not related to public deposits, it was related to private deposits",pos,train
"The largest such exposure is in the form of residential mortgage loans to individual borrowers in which the government provides a guarantee, similar to associate programs in the U",pos,train
"There is also been talk that there may be some technical amendments in the coming months, some of which may address Puerto Rico",pos,train
"So we will have to see how sustainable it is, hard to predict, where some people purchasing things are got damages in storm possibly, we’ll have to - we’re going to follow that carefully, it’s hard to predict, of course we believe it, but now we’re encouraged but we’re going to make sure it’s not onetime",pos,test
"I’m definitely - I think we’re looking at that same as very positive, obviously it’s a very conception statement, I think we all recognize",pos,train
"Now they might be done with different level of third party review, a number of other thing, so we hopefully can be more ideal at doing it and they may become less rigid, so that should help as well",pos,train
"It will eventually, I’m sure it will over next twelve months, I think what we will see is next twelve months that is mostly the investment phase as opposed to the benefiting from the crop phase",pos,train
We will continue to pursue our target of a double-digit return on tangible equity while keeping capital levels that are appropriate for Popular's risk profile,pos,train
"And so, we’re all very focused on looking at numbers of acquisitions",pos,train
"As it relates to additional money from tax reform that we’ll be able to invest, we’re focused upon current and future teammates, innovation both in technology and beyond as well as M&A",pos,train
Our goal each year is to deploy as much capital as we can that will generate appropriate returns for shareholders,pos,train
"As we get out to 2020, 2021, is there another technology update coming? I mean, what is being finished look like? And, how do you know that you can put a fine point on and say this is the end?",pos,train
So the answer is we continue to evaluate that as we speak,pos,train
"And so we are continuing to evaluate that as we speak, Kai",pos,train
"As a reminder, and I know we’ve talked about this before, but our investments in technology are a combination of: one, upgrading our systems the current versions; two, standardizing certain systems across the company such as having one agency management system for all of retail; three, reducing inefficient technology spend; and four, gaining better inside into our data, which we can use for the benefit of our teammates, customers and to grow our business",pos,train
"I’m just saying that we are evaluating all kinds of things in that space with our senior leadership team as we speak, so more color on that in the future",pos,train
"Finally, our services division is comprised mainly of claims processing businesses that work on behalf of private or public entities as well as our carrier partners and are supportive or complementary to our National Programs Division",pos,train
"During the fourth quarter, we did see a number of risk-bearers attempt to increase rates in the range of 10% to 20% on coastal property, but in most cases, these rates did not stick, as there is still an abundance of capital on the marketplace",pos,train
"With 28 or so private equity firms trying to put their capital to work, the space is crowded",pos,test
"However, we believe there are still a number of firms out there that fit culturally and make sense financially for us",pos,train
"No, I think the only process in extending out is in - this is why we’re trying to give the update is, as we got through these things and just looking at them, sometimes they just take longer to get done than anticipated",pos,train
"Over to Slide #10, similar to previous quarters, we thought it’d be beneficial to include a walk of our quarterly EBITDAC margins from last quarter to this year and highlight the main drivers",pos,train
"Additional discussion of these and other factors affecting the company’s business and prospects, as well as additional information regarding forward-looking statements is contained in the slide presentation posted in the connection with this call and the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission",pos,train
"However, I am very comfortable with our approach to analyzing and assessing potential acquisition candidates for cultural fit and financial returns",pos,test
"As a reminder, we are a decentralized sales and service organization, and we are standardizing some support functions with the goal of benefiting our teammates, our customers, and engaging deeper with our carrier partners",pos,train
And those risks and uncertainties identified from time to time in the company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,pos,train
"Generally, we’ll probably have some actual infrastructure or some technology refresh, but a lot of that is CapEx",pos,train
I think that it’s going to continue to be competitive,pos,train
"If private equity wants to pay a big ugly number for a business, they will do it",pos,train
"But we are looking to, obviously, improve that, but we’re making investments right now that would in the near term, as you saw this year, impact that",pos,train
These programs will give us platforms to support our growth and profitability in the future as well as to help us improve the experience for our teammates,pos,train
So I think one of the key milestones that we see in the first half is that we will actually have several of those opportunities progress all the way to supporting actual end customer orders,pos,train
"We think strength could continue into 2018 and beyond that would specifically include oil and gas, which is rebounding from the low levels in the last three years, and the mining machinery and equipment sector as well has some additional strength that we think position us well",pos,train
"We signed several long-term agreements with large customers such as Pratt & Whitney to supply isothermal forgings and power, and general dynamics land systems to supply titanium plate, which are both expected to drive segment growth trajectory for the next several years as well as allow us to continue to expand our strategic relationships with these diverse global customers",pos,train
There are some other opportunities out there that we could further structure the plan in a way that could further reduce it and we'll look at that and are looking at that,pos,train
"And that's on the strategic drawing board as well, so that we continue to look for ways to get out of the defined planned benefit business",pos,train
"The reason why it's slower this year is because the utilization or credit balance on the funding mechanism side, which will fully utilize and then 2019 goes up a little bit, and then it comes down assuming all the funding, all the assumptions hold true",pos,train
"And as we look forward with the building cash flow, we don't see any needs to issue any additional shares",pos,train
We believe that we're well positioned to build on 2017s foundation and to continue the financial improvement trends in 2018 and beyond in support of our longer-term objective of sustainable profitability and growth,pos,train
"The ATI team worked diligently to achieve our financial and operational goals to build a sustainably profitable business, which can consistently create value for our shareholders and customers, and opportunities for our employees",pos,train
We believe that we made substantial progress towards this objective in 2017 and we will remain focused on this objective in 2018 and beyond,pos,train
"And the really exciting part is that we actually through the HRPF can take one slab skew if you would and turn it into multiple different end products and grades as not something very many high rolling facilities around the world can do and that continues to excite the end user, but flexibility to lead time and certainly the expanded product offering",pos,train
These potential agreements are progressing favorably with additional production trials underway and are continuing to demonstrate our ability to meet demanding customer specifications,pos,train
", but can you help remind us what the NOL levels are just so we can run our numbers on that?",pos,train
"In addition to the improved financial results and strategic actions, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet and cash flow through purposeful actions and we expect to continue these efforts in 2018 to ensure that we maintain the ability to profitably grow our Company",pos,train
"And third, we signed a contract to supply high value nickel sheet products for use in a major pipeline repair project outside the United States",pos,train
Given our expectations for improved earnings and cash flows in 2018 and beyond we expect our balance sheet and financial strength to continue to improve over the next several years,pos,train
"First, we continue to work on reducing balance sheet risk by taking actions to decrease participation in our defined benefit pension plan with lump sum cash out of approximately 1,350 deferred vested participants in the fourth quarter of 2017",pos,train
Specific liability management actions such as lump sum cash outs and an annuity buyout to reduce the number of participants in the ATI defined benefit pension plan by over 20% since 2012,pos,train
We think they'll be an opportunity to look at that in 2019 as we continue to expand our cash flow generation,pos,train
"We continue to make progress on strengthening our balance sheet, which will enable sustainable long-term profitable growth and ensure that we have sufficient capital available for fund future strategic initiatives",pos,train
"So I think we use a lot of input from the standpoint of the producers, from the standpoint of the traders, from the standpoint of investment firms such as yourself and others that look at the underlying dynamics and fundamentals of the nickel market in terms of how we construct our plan",pos,train
"And we're looking forward to as well potential other actions to finally close, and this would be a soft freeze for the remaining operations that are still outstanding that that potential will exists here, this year in 2018",pos,train
We continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet and we made significant progress in 2017,pos,test
ATI has a long history of investment grade credit ratings and it is our goal to return to that level in the future,pos,train
"So that will also drive growth over the next three to five years, but aerospace, obviously, commercial aerospace will be the largest piece",pos,train
I think what we're seeing now in terms of the very large industrial gas turbines is a significant slowdown that the OEMs I’ve commented on,pos,train
"Second, we signed two significant long-term agreements to supply high value titanium plate products to General Dynamics Land Systems, one in the United States and one in the UK",pos,train
"Yes, I think the pace of the actual announcements on commercial agreements is driven as much by the end customer and when they're ready to go public and people do see the competitive advantage that comes from the HRPF and candidly like to keep it for themselves as long as humanly possible",pos,train
And we would expect that that would continue through the first quarter and then some of these opportunities will become more crystallized as we get into the second quarter and most likely benefit the second half of the year,pos,train
"But I think the excitement level on the part of our conversion customers continues to grow when they see what the – as Bob indicated, when they see what the capabilities of the HRPF are",pos,test
"And then they will find themselves to riding, if you will, in our Hong Kong branch",pos,train
"So it really doesn't move the needle at all on the trades to date, but I think you get a sense of why we're excited about the potential future, given the investments we've already made in contents and platforms and our position relative to trading in American markets",pos,train
So our anticipation is that in the next few quarters we'll continue to invest,pos,train
"And in terms of the types of things that we're looking to invest in, then they continue to be on the theme of innovation",pos,train
"And they will be both revenue enhancing, as well as utilizing hopefully new technologies to take out operating expense in future years",pos,train
"It is a bit of an opportunity to, if you will, parse out your offerings and perhaps have investing in trading as a service that becomes more available to clients on these social networks, but it's early days",pos,train
"Our operation in Singapore continues to see strong steady growth, and we expect to see similar trends in Hong Kong over time",pos,test
"Scottrade's domestically focused Asian business provides an additional synergy here, as we combined our legacy operation with our growing Asian footprint",pos,test
And then as we think about -- as you guys think about the options of reinvesting to some of that also includes the potential for doing another large online brokerage acquisition down the road?,pos,train
"I guess, are we starting to see maybe more fundamentally a convergence of the platforms, as you say? I know you're talking about partnerships and so on, but in terms of financial and social",pos,train
Like how does both cash and client access assets break down institutional versus retail? And what's the difference in the deposit beta in those 2 cash bouts?,pos,train
"As the fastest growing wealth hub in Asia, Hong Kong offers a great opportunity with access to a market that is tech savvy, hungry for education and eager to have access to the U",pos,train
"And in terms of investments in Mainland China, again, the beauty of this strategy in today's day and age is that there are already established media channels, networks that, frankly, dwarf the North American equivalents",pos,train
"And over time, we're -- as we get more experienced with the product, we're looking to expand it out but slowly",pos,train
"As we extend the excess flow over the next few months, we expect to approach our targeted overall duration of 2",pos,train
"I know it's very early days, but any color on early uptick there? And just the size of the push you're making in terms of allocating resources in advertising budget to that launch? And then maybe you could help us better understand what a potential launch into Mainland China would look like, and the time line around that?",pos,train
"And so I think again, the trick here is to make sure that we are innovating, that we are learning, that we are partnering appropriately and that we have the best opportunity to expand, as I said, given its strategic ability and size of a marketplace without having to make, such extraordinary large initial outlays given the market conditions today",pos,train
"Frankly, from our point of view, our operating performance is strong enough that the additional investments that we can make post our Scottrade conversion, which is coming up soon, can all be absorbed by that",pos,train
"The high tech is, as you've seen, we have the best technology platforms, which we will continue to invest in, and we will iterate with",pos,train
"The right touch, as you know, we are moving to branch network in North America of 364 branches, our two offices in Singapore and Hong Kong and will have, I would say, about 87% of North American wealth covered in those -- in that physical presence",pos,test
"And so if there is a right opportunity to find the right partnership, absolutely there is an opportunity for client acquisition and servicing our existing clients, as we say, bring investing and trading to where our clients already are",pos,train
This is just one example of the investments we're making in technology and innovation to transform how people invest,pos,train
"Some of that will flow in Q2 as we focus more efforts on the final stages of the clearing conversion, but we continue to make very good progress",pos,test
So we're pretty comfortable that we're right within the range and that the numbers will be consistent going forward if we stay with this kind of market,pos,train
"And so as we consider our performance and our plans to build upon the strong growth momentum we're here to talk about today, know that we're doing so with this purpose in mind",pos,train
"And we're keeping those particular branches and folding that into our broader overall Asian strategy, both to service clients here, as well as there",pos,train
"So from an OpEx point of view, again reiterate, yes, any additional investments we make between now and year-end, partly, it's just a deal with the higher volumes that we're seeing, and partly, it is to take advantage of the higher revenue rates, assuming it continues to invest, but we're talking relatively small dollars",pos,train
"The broker protocol, specifically, there's still some sifting out in the marketplace that's happening as, obviously, some firms have opted out",pos,train
"Starting this week, TD Ameritrade will be the first to offer 24-hour trading, five days a week, in select securities through our thinkorswim and TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader platforms",pos,train
"They are very interested in cutting edge technology and platforms, and we have the best of those",pos,train
"And once you build it with some translation and we've done the translation, you can start disseminating it through many of these social networks, which are much more pervasive in the Asian marketplace even than they are in America",pos,train
"And so we think the combination of things we've already invested in, with a very small additional amount of work around translation, it can be served out to an extraordinary large marketplace",pos,train
"We believe education is core to a positive investing experience and sustained investor engagement, and we will continue to invest in its development to make sure it remains relevant to the needs of our clients",pos,train
"And then on the 24-hour trading initiative, can you guys talk to us a little bit conceptually on how that's going to work? I guess I'm wondering who's going be making a market in securities? Is it just Ameritrade customers trading amongst themselves? Or something else going on?",pos,train
Identifying scalable ways to take our services and education direct-to-consumer will continue to be a key focus for ongoing innovation efforts,pos,train
Are there any different checks and balances on this product? Or anything that may prevent inexperienced investors from going in big and potentially losing money in this product down the road?,pos,train
"And so the idea behind 24-hour trading is to allow for out-of-market trading to happen, when you have these -- that's why we chose these 12 particular symbols, because they allow you exposure to very broad swaps of taking positions in the marketplace and sometimes to mitigate the risk",pos,train
"And we expect that to be an opportunity going forward to enhance trades to some degree, and also give another option to our already active traders",pos,train
"Relative to the second quarter over the first quarter, as we've said, yes, it will be commensurate with that, it's probably a little even a bit more",pos,train
"Again, partly because of the advertising bump we get, the second quarter Scottrade activity and frankly, if it continues at the current rate, we will want to make sure we're taking advantage of the opportunities of the current high level of retail engagement",pos,train
"So we have the opportunity to move some uninsured deposits, which is about $10 billion to third parties",pos,train
"So, if I do look at the competitive landscape, I think deposit pricing is probably the toughest place, yeah, the thing that we worry about the most",pos,train
"So, without really putting a lot of infrastructure in branches and back office and so on, it’s more about hiring producers in the right places and the right kinds of producers that we can do – you can do a lot of business with two or three people as long as you’ve hired the right people",pos,train
The combined accretable yield is still forecasted to increase as we move forward for 2018,pos,train
"We currently estimate that around 25%, but as you know that can be difficult to predict with precision",pos,train
"And we've done this all while redirecting our strategy to diversify our business mix, diversify our balance sheet and we were able to achieve that in a pretty meaningful way, in a very short 12-month timeframe",pos,train
The shares may be purchased through open market transactions or private transactions from time to time in amounts that the management determines to be appropriate,pos,train
"Your push towards the non-multifamily, more C&I, some theory, but as you make at that push, do you need to change how you operate in New York? Do you need to open up a lot more branches, or how are you driving that growth because it is a different strategy than just multifamily?",pos,train
"Putting that aside and the thinking over there, just a little bit on that, as you all know, we do a business plan, a three-year business plan at the end of each year looking forward three years out and we basically ran our best guess or what the company can do over the course of next three years given what we know about the environment",pos,train
"Some of that business continues to come from your existing brokerage channels because your major brokers not only obviously represent multi-family owners, but they represent other asset classes as well and we have clients that are not exclusively multi-family players",pos,train
I certainly hope that all of that will stay at the bottom line and it will be a permanent pickup,pos,train
"I think it's just a few of our primary regulator that the underlying collateral which is New York multi-family loans with the cap rates that they have, they are in stratospheric valuation categories, and nothing good happens lending into that over the long haul",pos,test
"And we said, if we have any excess capital that we cannot deploy for the next three years, that's probably too much capital and that's also about $150 million and we said let's put that aside for a share repurchase program",pos,train
Are you seeing and that remain consistent as you head into the early stages of 2018 to -- should we project sort of a similar trend?,pos,train
"So more of what you see today is refinancing of existing debt versus new transactions happening in that market has become increasingly dominated by government-sponsored entities, LifeCo and other long-term players who are in the market at rates and structures…",pos,test
"So, targeting double-digit loan and deposit growth, where do you think the loan growth is going to continue to be skewed towards Florida in the national platform, I assume?",pos,train
"So, we're seeing significant opportunities within things like international trade and transportation",pos,train
"But as you know, we're focused -- at least I am very much focused on 2020, more than 2018 or 2019 because I know this is going to be a noisy year with loss share, the next year as well",pos,train
I hope that we preserve that and that continues and its permanent and not competed away in the marketplace,pos,train
"It will be -- yes, in New York, outside of multifamily asset plans, everything else is expected to continue to grow",pos,test
"You should expect an increase in cost of deposits simply because these great moves with the Fed tend to happen towards the later part of a quarter, which it did this time as well in December",pos,train
"So that's the big part of that bill, that in terms of M&A also, for example, any $30 billion bank volume or margin we’re selling, if you think about that threshold as these assets that are on our balance sheet will certainly cross that threshold",pos,train
"Now, the tax benefit, how much of that throws down to the bottom line, I hope initially all of it will, and over time, we'll see how competitive the landscape is and what the marketplace does",pos,train
"But putting that aside, we’ve always said that this business model which is not a fee-centric business model but more traditional lending-based business model or credit-heavy business model, in the long term, you should be able to get to a 1% ROA and slightly north of 10% ROE",pos,train
"So, how will that change the landscape of municipal finance? Will the paper become more attractive to individuals versus corporates? Does that – is that a good thing or a bad thing for us? How much of an impact will that have on our business? There are a lot of moving parts to this",pos,test
"We charged the loans down to that value and in recognition of continued downward trends in valuations and some limited number of sales at lower prices, we maintain an additional 15% haircut to that valuation in the form of a specific reserve",pos,train
"Even the legislative environment is getting better, and there might be some legislative reforms as it relates to bank regulation",pos,train
There are fair amount of projects coming out and fair amount of serial opportunities,pos,train
I think we likely will continue to see some moderation to that portfolio but probably not at the same velocity as in 2017,pos,train
"I mean, I think, my guess would be that the state public time deposit space is mostly helpful, but I think they’re probably also some national or international players in that space",pos,train
"Pricing has gotten well outside of what we're seeing in other substantial deposit segments for us, and frankly we don't have the requirements to the funds on our balance sheet",pos,train
"We haven't talked about pricing and I'm not sure, we're going to get into that, but I will give you guidance that the pricing in the government time space is well in excess of what we're experiencing in the consumer time space, in excess of 1% even, for less than a year",pos,train
"And as those mature out, often time people choose to take our assets elsewhere",pos,train
"And so, we're to look at both of those businesses, we're going to really put a conservative effort into 2018 to provide customers with both options either come in to the trust side or to the broker dealer side, and obviously catering towards best of them, by bottom line garnering business one way or the other",pos,train
"And finally, our capital management strategy going forward will remain consistent with our current strategy which is to pay off approximately 50% of net income in dividends to maintain adequate capital to support our business growth with the minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7% with the remainder available for share repurchases",pos,train
I think it does allow us to accumulate capital more rapidly and possibly to utilize more capital in the future in terms of cash stock mix,pos,train
2% as we continue to balance growth with our objective of improving returns and capital deployed in this portfolio,pos,train
"And remembering that the non-banking businesses, with the exception of what you're acquiring, you don't use a lot of incremental capital to add growth in those businesses, because they essentially don't have a balance sheet",pos,train
What is the employee benefits business do in terms of efficiency? What's the wealth and insurance business doing in terms of efficiency? And what is that -- the improvement year-over-year?,pos,train
"Looking forward, we continue to expect Federal Reserve Bank semiannual dividends in the second and fourth quarters each year, but because we expect to be above $10 billion in assets for all of 2018, our dividend rate will be approximate a third of the level we experienced in 2017",pos,train
"So I hope that helps at all, Collyn, the auto book will probably, in 2018, be off a little bit in terms of volume as well but I would expect the yields to remain higher",pos,train
"Mortgage and home equity will move forward as usual, 3% give or take and then commercial we’ll see what happens with the early pay-offs",pos,train
"I would expect it’ll be up next year, because there is some activity in the market",pos,train
"We're very optimistic about 2018 and as always, remain mindful of our obligations to deliver exceptional returns to our shareholders",pos,train
"I suspect Jake we would also evaluate a sale all or part of that municipal portfolio, as Scott said, the benefit to us is a lot less",pos,train
"But the earnings levels are strong and will even get stronger in 2018 so it just creates that much bigger of a challenge to deploy the capital, which certainly gives us more dividend capacity as well",pos,test
"I mean, I think we have particular discipline around what we focus on with M&A, has to be qualitatively high value, it's got to be economically high value, it's got to fit in our expected geographic footprint and future expansion potential for that footprint",pos,test
"In summary, we believe we’re very well-position from both the capital and an operational perspective for 2018 and beyond, and as Mark mentioned, look forward to continuing to execute on future required inorganic improvement opportunities",pos,test
"So we have to be mindful of that ever reaching, but I think this is just -- it creates more of a good profit to have Alex in terms of accumulating that capital more quickly than we can used to effect high value M&A opportunities for the benefit to shareholders, but more effective core strategy",pos,test
And so I definitely agree -- we’re probably likely to see net cash flows of our municipal portfolio and certainly co-filling hoping that shape of the curve will allow us some productive reinvestments,pos,train
"So I think if you look at an extension further into New England that's a possibility, I think further opportunities in Pennsylvania is an opportunity and I think Ohio remains an opportunity for us",pos,train
"And so I think the current market we’re in, if it continues to be strong economically, strong multiples in the marketplace, strong operating performance, I think that will put somewhat of a damper on any acceleration of M&A",pos,train
"I suspect we will, as board does every, I think third quarter of the year, we will evaluate the dividend again in the third quarter",pos,train
And so we’ve made some modest accommodations to maintain the balances and respond to the competitive market pressure,pos,train
"And so, as we look to '18, we continue to talk to banks about potential acquisitions",pos,train
"And obviously, acquisitions, as they come along, building capital here, the problem with acquisitions these days seems to be that most acquisitions are mostly stock",pos,train
With these addition we are well-positioned to pursue organic growth opportunities in the year ahead,pos,train
We will continue to support and invest in the recovery effort in both Sonoma and Napa County,pos,train
"So I think we're - for us, it's an opportunity to step back and say, okay, so what kind of investments should we be making then maybe we would have deferred but now might be a good time to invest, because our earnings are going to be up substantially because of the tax change and it really does give us that opportunity to look at those investments",pos,train
"I'm very optimistic going forward about the opportunities that it's going to bring, because our customers will have more cash, more capital available to invest and I think just like with us I think that's going to happen",pos,train
"In the coming year, we will continue to evaluate strategic M&A opportunities that fit with our culture and add value to our shareholders",pos,train
"We think we have most of that done, but there are a few other securities that we might take action on",pos,train
"And with regard to other things might impact the income statement going forward, you know, you have scheduled accretion for the acquired loans",pos,train
"Our most recent forecast is that when all is said and done, there will be a little left and we model then evaluated the deal",pos,train
"As we walk through the income statement, quarter-over-quarter comparisons also demonstrate continuing growth and profitability, while investing in our team and our platform",pos,train
But they are also bidding those other projects which bring other additional funds in,pos,train
"As we continue to serve customers across a wide range of industry sectors, the wine making and non-profit organizations, we will remain focused on this model",pos,test
We are excited about the future and the many opportunities we see to enhance the value of our bank,pos,train
"We have customers, I'm sure, that will be looking at opportunities to do things that maybe they would have delayed, but now with the tax law changed, that they have more capital available to do those projects",pos,train
"And that would, potentially move to opportunities for us for financing",pos,train
"And you know that the differential, as we go forward, with rates continuing to rise, the differential and the value of this deposit franchise that we have will show an even greater amount in the future because that margin will expand because of that",pos,train
So it's going to take a long time to where they actually have projects that are starting to rebuild,pos,train
We think it advantage when it comes to building trust and long-term relationships with clients and generating loan growth and a low-cost deposit base,pos,train
"I mean, one of the things we do is we do have a fair number of financing that we we've done and continue to do going forward for tax and borrowers",pos,train
"The opportunities as we were looking at things we never would have put into the plan at all, we have to look at facilities and how we might be able to right size, if not move, not out of the facilities, but we have a lot of space, maybe we can reduce our space",pos,train
"We feel good about the, as I said before, the breadth of that business now, the position we have in terms of underwriting and climbing up the tables and the swings we're having based on the size of the client base and the fact that that’s growing",pos,train
"Our overall goal in commercial is to raise returns and build strong relationships, while still achieving good loan growth",pos,train
I mean I think that we set that target in part related to business opportunities that we talked about before and the fact that we continue to have organic and other opportunities to deploy capital over time that are accretive that we want to balance against the capital return and just where we are in our life cycle as a company post IPO,pos,train
"We have a mission to really make a difference for our customers, colleagues and communities, so that they can reach their potential",pos,train
Things that can focus on and deliver this will build long-term franchise value and stand out in a crowded banking landscape,pos,train
"To get there, we will rely on our customer centric culture, our mindset of continuous improvement and building excellent capabilities",pos,train
"As you know, we have been reducing the size of our auto portfolio and that should continue over time",pos,train
"Suffice it to say, we believe we have a good plan and a good leadership team that is executing well across the board, giving us confidence in our outlook",pos,train
"We continue to deliver well on our strategic initiatives and we continue to do more and better for our key stakeholders, for our customers, our colleagues and the communities that we serve",pos,train
We remain focused on raising our capital return to shareholders,pos,train
"And then, I'd say there's other opportunities around mortgage, for example, buying MSRs, if you want to account that as an acquisition is another thing and maybe some things in the payment space and some of the things we're doing with fin-tech",pos,train
"So I think that in terms of our own spend, we're going to mainly let it flow through",pos,train
And we continue to be focused on returning capital to shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%,pos,train
"There's also a little bit of seasoning in some of the consumer portfolios that will start to move the charge-off number up a little bit, certainly, well behaved and in control, but that would also be a factor that comes with a good thing, if all the net interest income is being delivered",pos,train
"And then just a follow-up specifically more on some of the loan buckets that continue to run down as part of it, do you actually get a line of sight into the home equity and auto and where and how far out do you see this stabilization in those parts of the buckets or are they just going to kind of continually drift down?",pos,train
"Just in terms of where we're spending money, one of the things that we've been pleased with is we've said that for much of the last five years, we were playing catch up in terms of our technology spend in freshening our application suite and the infrastructure that we run",pos,train
"And so there's a lot more funding going into things like digital, so the origination and fulfillment platforms that will create efficiencies and better customer experiences",pos,train
"We still have opportunities for deploying that capital and when we find opportunities to deploy that capital organically and in an accretive way, we think that's a good use of the capital",pos,train
"We continue to compare the ability to deploy the capital against what the economics would be of a buyback and when we find opportunities that are accretive, we would deploy that on behalf of shareholders and that glide path over time will -- we will resume that march downward",pos,train
"So there's a little bit of pruning of the number of locations, but the greater element of that program is trying to take 4200 square foot branches and turn them into 2500 or 2200 square foot branches",pos,train
"One of the things I will point out is notwithstanding, we had far fewer hikes than what we assumed when we put the IPO targets out we found other ways to compensate",pos,train
"Continuous improvement is part of our DNA and we continue to become more efficient, which allows us to fund our growth initiatives and maintain strong operating leverage",pos,train
"So that is -- because it's a two year duration, relatively short portfolio, we can use that as a shock absorber based on what other loan demand is out there in the marketplace",pos,train
"And then on the consumer side, really the wealth to us remains the really big upside area and we've fought a few headwinds, by having mix shift and kind of how we approached the business and how the business plays out in terms of products, but we're moving much more towards a managed money orientation as opposed to a transactional orientation around annuities",pos,train
"But in the long term, that's actually quite positive, because it will build up more annuity like book of revenues and I think those lines are getting pretty close to crossing and you can see in Q4, we had a nice step up and we would expect to see that continue",pos,train
"And so I think the good news here is that we can get a very acceptable ROEs, medium term ROEs and still maintain what we think is a strong capital position that gives us flexibility as John described",pos,train
"So, all of that will drive towards the mid single digit growth that we're targeting for 2018 on the fee side and we’re going to be working hard to achieve that goal",pos,train
"So when the LCR begins to be published and I think investors pay more attention to that, I think the LDR over time becomes the secondary measurement",pos,train
So you would be adding to reserves to fund the loan growth,pos,train
We want to take increasing leadership positions in the transactions that we’re involved in,pos,train
"With that, let's move on and discuss the balance sheet",pos,train
"On page 14, you can see we continue to grow our balance sheet and expand our NIM",pos,train
"I think the way to answer that is, it's going to be a moving mix of fees across M&A and bond underwriting and syndicated lending and leverage finance based on deal flow that’s materializing",pos,train
The key areas that would drive that on the consumer side continue to be education loans and mortgage as well as on secured,pos,test
"And so, those things will continue to drive growth into 2018",pos,train
"But as always, our focus will be on execution and the things that we can control",pos,train
We expect credit quality to remain well controlled as our charge-offs should gradually normalize and some growth in provision will be needed for loan growth,pos,train
"Taking a deeper look into NII and NIM on pages 10 and 11, we continue to deliver attractive and disciplined balance sheet growth, which helped us drive a 2% linked quarter increase in NII",pos,train
"So I think we've seen a lot of it, although every transaction is quite competitive, both on bank balance sheets and on site balance sheets through this intermediation of the bond market and the non-bank markets also",pos,train
We are continuing to make investments in our ability to be more targeted in our deposit offerings,pos,test
"And I think, we have all of those tools in the toolbox with respect to our deposit categories and from time to time, we will have a promotional strategy on term, which allows us to control cannibalization and other things that may happen in a promotional approach, but we're more pleased with our DBA growth and really that's the driver of all of the initiatives that you're hearing about, coming out of the consumer space with all the investments that we're meeting there in terms of better pricing and investments in data and analytics",pos,train
"And the targeting that we're doing there from a digital perspective, so our emphasis is on DDA and from time to time, we can serve our customers in a promotional way through term",pos,train
Let's move and invest in our direct to consumer business and then let's get scale in the servicing by buying some MSRs,pos,train
"And Ken, you may recall the trajectory that we used to put up quarters in the 20s for capital markets and we had the 30s, the 40s, 50s and I was joking that 50 is the new 30, but I think there will be some volatility based on market conditions and when deals close",pos,test
"First, we believe that our commitment to continuous improvement through execution of TOP programs and BSO is differentiating and will drive continued outperformance versus peers",pos,test
"Second, we are excited about the opportunities to leverage the investments that we've made in our fee based businesses over the last few years",pos,train
"I think overall, we have a tremendous opportunity to continue investing, to build up these businesses and to realize the revenue potential in our franchise",pos,train
"And lastly, prudent capital management and balance sheet rate positioning will continue to help drive improving returns",pos,train
"Suffice it to say, we are executing well overall and we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed",pos,train
"Even if that occurs, we can still stay on this path and it's anchored not only through our 5% asset sensitivity, but the fact that that will actually moderate over time along with the flattening, so that’s built in",pos,train
"We think the loans will follow the M&A pipelines and are indicative of new money demand we might see and I would remind people that we really rolled out the regional strategies midyear last year, so they're going to begin to take hold this year as we add new clients",pos,train
So we’ve got a combination of more activity with our existing clients and then adding new opportunities into the book,pos,train
"I'll start off and then I’ll turn it over to Brad or Bruce or whoever wants to add in, but -- and I think the -- I think auto will be a gradual glide over the medium term and we frankly use that as a way to drive upside by finding higher risk return opportunities in the education space or in other areas in unsecured and that allows us to run down the auto book on that kind of path",pos,train
"Over on consumer, we have I think a desire to really capture the potential that we have in wealth management in the organization",pos,train
"And I think what's interesting to note is that we have a pipeline of potentially some other partners that are going to be coming on stream as the year goes by, which should continue to add to the growth",pos,train
"And so that occurred and as expected, I think looking forward, you could think about similar behavior in the quarters in which there's a Fed hike, in the quarter that after the Fed hike, you can see betas rise and that’s as expected",pos,train
"I mean, we came out of 4Q and saw that in the industry as well as in our own businesses, a little bit of softening in some of our areas that which drive that loan growth, but we're seeing some pick up and the pipelines are strong",pos,train
"And as we go through the first quarter, if we can realize those pipelines and see the pull through that we expect and we'll see a pickup later in the year",pos,train
We will maintain our mindset of continuous improvement in 2018 and we will look to drive more TOP and BSO program benefits,pos,train
"We feel our balance sheet capital and credit position remain robust and as we head into 2018, we feel very good about our ability to grow the business and drive towards our new targets",pos,test
We're making good steady progress across the board as we aim to become a top performing bank,pos,train
"First, one of the luxuries, I suppose, of the diversity of the growth opportunities we have is that our constraint as a company on the levels of customer-facing growth investing we do each year is really not that we run out of opportunities with very attractive long-term economics, but more that we do manage the Company for a mixture of short, medium and long-term objectives",pos,test
"And so, when you look at the opportunities we have to invest for growth, generally in any given year, there are a variety of unfunded initiatives with good economics that we choose not to pursue, because doing so in the short run would not allow us to meet our financial objectives",pos,train
"And if you think about where those next best previously unfunded opportunities are, they are probably where you would expect it",pos,train
"So, those are the kinds of things that you will see us with the last incremental dollar of investment likely pursue",pos,train
"But I think the broader and important point here is, we always tend to have a pool of rally good opportunities left unfunded",pos,train
"So, if you think about the timing of all this, we -- the decision to top up our profit-sharing is one we made in the days after passage of the Tax Act as we thought about the overall economics of the Company going forward and over the long-term, as we thought about the strength of our 2017 results and as we thought about doing something very consistent with our view that we’re about the long-term, we’re about the long-term for our shareholders in terms of performance, were about long-term relationships with our customers and we want to be about the long-term wellbeing of our employees",pos,train
"As we move ahead in 2018, we will be focused on the four key priorities that Steve laid out on last quarter’s call, strengthening our leadership in the premium consumer segment; extending our leadership in commercial payments and in particular with small and medium-sized enterprises; playing an even bigger role in the digital lives of our customers; and strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value",pos,train
"And I don’t see it as changing anything about our value propositions; I do want to come back to that, or changing anything about the level of incentives we need to put into the marketplace to attract any particular customer set",pos,train
"Over the next few months, as we develop our 2018 CCAR submission, our goal will be to get back on our trajectory towards capital ratios consistent with our plans prior to tax reform while supporting balance sheet growth in the business",pos,train
We are going to produce more capital in the next couple of years than we otherwise would have that’s going to drive bigger capital returns,pos,train
"So, other than the revaluation, I wouldn’t expect it to have any different impact on our regulatory capital calculations going forward than others",pos,train
We often put a little bit of that into our shareholders’ pocket and we put a little bit to work funding some of these initiatives that we can’t necessarily get to in the normal course of business,pos,train
Most corporations like us are trying to control T&E spending because this is more T&E oriented,pos,train
"And that as I said a quarter doesn’t make a trend, but it’s an interesting data point, if you think about a little bit more confidence in the economy and a little bit more of plan to spend",pos,train
"But, our objective is going to remain what can we do to drive the most revenue growth and that will have varied implications over time I think to the discount rates",pos,train
"So, I think that we will use the two-quarter stoppage of the share repurchase program to very quickly get our capital ratios back into a range that all of the rating agencies, the regulators and we are comfortable with",pos,train
"The plan does not necessarily assume a quicker take-up on some of the new and innovative things that we continue to do both in our proprietary product lines, as well as with cobrand partners like Delta or Marriott or Hilton",pos,test
"So, considering our tax situation as well as strong Company performance as I previously stated, we chose to support the long-term wellbeing of our employees by making it incremental contribution to our employee profit sharing programs, which in most cases go directly to employees’ retirement accounts",pos,train
"And over the long run, we are excited about the opportunity to grow the portfolios and drive ongoing benefits for our customers, our partners and our shareholders",pos,test
"But, you should have confidence and based on what we’ve seen recently and if we get a little stronger economy and/or some of the new things we’re doing take off a little quicker, that will really help us to get to the upside",pos,train
"As we’ve said before, we see attractive opportunities to continue to grow lending across multiple fronts",pos,train
"And in general, we are trying to make sure we provide good returns for our accountholders but just competitive returns",pos,train
And we’re comfortable with the balances we have and with our ability to attract new balances,pos,train
"At our Investor Day in early March, we look forward to providing more insight into our growth opportunities",pos,train
This is partly due to the dollar weakening year-over-year versus the major currencies we operate in overseas but also reflects strong underlying growth,pos,test
"Second, as I mentioned, we decided to suspend our share repurchase program for the first two quarters in 2018, but we will continue dividend payments",pos,train
"So, on Marriott and Hilton, the way I would describe this is, as you commonly see in these larger cobrands where you have very long-term agreements, as they are renewed, there tends to be a step down in economics and we work over the course of the subsequent five, seven, eight years to really rebuild the economics",pos,train
We expect the dynamic in 2018 to remain pretty consistent with 2017,pos,train
"Our loan growth is expected to exceed the industry as we continue to focus on increasing our share of lending, particularly with existing customers",pos,train
"Lending write-off rates and delinquencies are expected to continue to increase, but we believe we will remain below the industry average",pos,train
We expect continued strong momentum in our billings and loans metrics as we capture the diverse growth opportunities we see across our customer segment,pos,train
"What we have done effective January 1 is we’ve divided that so that David Weaver is continuing to drive the community bank commercial and Brant Standridge, one of our newer, younger executive leaders who's had a lot of experience out in the field, has had a lot of experience in auto and mortgage and specialized in these businesses, he is now driving directly every day the brand side, the retail side of the community bank",pos,train
"So basically, we've doubled the executive amplitude, executive leadership in the community bank and we know that is going to generate substantially more performance as we laser focus in on the productivity of the sources that we have invested in that side of the bank",pos,test
Our growth is being driven by a virtue of the fact that our market will be growing faster and we have more focus on actually making the execution strategies that we have worked,pos,train
"And so, and from my point of view, again without giving specific guidance, I believe we will -- I know we will intend to continue to focus on that as we get through ’18 and ’19, I believe that will keep downward pressure on expenses even as we become better at what we're doing",pos,train
"And so I would not be surprised if we're able to hold expenses in the flattish range ’18 and ’19, but I'm not going to make a commitment on that",pos,train
"And if I think about the flat expense guidance, should we be assuming then that you're finding efficiencies in other areas that are roughly of the same magnitude as the 150 million to 200 million that you mentioned?",pos,train
"Our mortgage area continues to grow as we continued our, keeping our penetration in that market, that should be up and then investment banking and brokerage",pos,train
"And as we go forward over the rest of this year and into next year, you will see our loan growth, I think, meaningfully increase, because of that painful process we needed to go through, but good process from a long term strategic point of view",pos,train
"Our Zelle P2P program, like all of the other major banks in the country rolled out recently, it's going extraordinarily well",pos,train
"We have and we will continue to substantially increase our investment in marketing, around our digital presentation to the marketplace",pos,train
"In reality, this merger is turning out about like all other mergers and we've gone through the painful part, is a great long term investment as what we thought and begins what we think now and we're very happy about it",pos,train
"Our mortgage portfolio, we're expanding in a lot of new markets and other places in terms of our brokerage business around the country",pos,train
Our wealth business continues to grow and we invest substantially more assets in that,pos,train
"Investment income, as Daryl mentioned, was up about 12% and we continue to invest in the wealth and in our full service broker, which has got really good momentum",pos,train
"Saul, [indiscernible] That will be reinvested and it will be reinvested in the category areas that I mentioned and that's -- part of it is already ongoing, part of it will be new, but it will be pretty wide spread, but all marginally designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our business and also the client offerings to our business, so that we are fresh and appealing to our clients on the marketplace",pos,train
Small business opportunity is very strong as we go forward,pos,train
"So certainly, Kelly talked about we have some very aggressive strategies at some higher margin businesses and particularly in the retail and subsidiaries that have higher margins and higher normal losses, and so I think if we’re successful in growing some of those businesses faster, then, you would probably see us move higher in the range, but you certainly have offsetting margin to compensate for that",pos,train
"So just from normalization, as we move forward, would also move us and others up in the range as well",pos,train
"[indiscernible] foundation, build a program so that going forward, you won’t hear us saying, we will grow this year and not grow next year",pos,train
"So, we have substantial investments that we are making in the business",pos,train
So what you can see is that we're making those investments that we alluded to and we're holding expenses flat,pos,train
"I mean, this whole opportunity in terms of advanced capabilities and computers, call it, advanced intelligence -- artificial intelligence, robotics, all of the things that you're reading and hearing about, this is all real and banks are just absolutely loaded with opportunities to apply these new techniques to rationalize our expense structures and become more efficient and more effective at the same time",pos,train
"We have laser focused on organic growth, which is a big deal",pos,train
"To put all that together, it’s a good time to be in banking, so we think 2018 will be a very strong year",pos,train
"So that's a pretty big deal and you will see our retail performance improve substantially as we go forward, not just the optimization portfolios reversing, but also the emphasis on new products and new strategies and new execution focuses that will come out of those changes",pos,train
"Obviously, over time, depending on what the regulators require, you will always be continuing to tweak and improve that as you go along, but we've essentially built out what we expected to build out",pos,train
"North Georgia, including Atlanta and also South Carolina markets, so really good broad based in the new markets, but also some of the core markets like Alabama and South Carolina are doing well",pos,train
"And then finally, I’d point out that we, in addition to all that, we are tightly focused on organic growth",pos,train
"We are in the midst of rolling out what we call voice of the client, which is a major way of tracking the client as they tiptoe through our company from area to area",pos,train
"A big deal, we are doing a major substantial restructure in our IT area, around dev ops, AI, robotics, all of the areas that will make that whole area substantially more effective and frankly less expensive",pos,train
"We are making substantial increased investments in a variety of areas, in the business, in terms of restructuring and reinvesting in our community bank, in terms of our digital offering, in terms of the marketing of a digital offering, in terms of cyber security, risk management structures, it’s just a long list of new and increased focuses that we have to make the business better",pos,train
So curious more about the strategic initiative or strategic push into retail that you said will be accentuated,pos,train
"Look, I mean, the Pittsburgh, I mean, sorry, the Philadelphia market is a great market and huge wealth, not just deposit, but lending businesses, the corporate businesses there, the trade services, the middle part of Pennsylvania is exactly like North Carolina, really stable balanced growth opportunities for us",pos,train
"So, yeah, it will be deposits that will be growth in loans and it will be relative improvement in efficiency",pos,train
"We simply said these markets are irrational, we're not going to continue to deploy capital in a rational business segment",pos,train
So we’re going to be running our business smartly and we would be growing and the growth would take us where it takes us,pos,train
"So all that taken in to account, and as Kelly said, if we have two rate increases throughout the year, I think core will continue to trend up as we have those rate increases and beta continues to lag",pos,train
"A lot of new investments in scorecards and process and center consolidation and a lot of investment to execute that strategy, so we're bullish on both of those businesses",pos,test
"A lot of speculation about what’s going to happen going forward, my own view is that betas will go up, but they will go slowly until and unless loan growth really takes off",pos,train
But the fact is industry and we don't need to substantially raise prices on deposits until and unless loan growth will take off,pos,train
"We think there will be some increase in loan growth, but to expect betas to dramatically increase in the short term, I think would be inappropriate",pos,train
"We are seeing activity in terms of them investing in the businesses, so the economy is going to be better in ’18 and further we believe",pos,train
"Over the next year, we will continue to refine those allocations",pos,train
"So we think that as an opportunity that we're probably underpenetrated in and we can grow safely within our risk appetite, some of the areas, industrial, office",pos,train
"But practically, I would say the most likely area that we could exceed would be on the loan area",pos,test
"If we beat in the area, I think it will be loans",pos,train
"As we move forward, we will continue to maintain our focus on resolvability and resiliency",pos,test
"One is just can you characterize the $575 billion of core asset servicing wins and where they're coming from? And then in clearing, can you talk about that termination fee and either -- help us size it and what the go-forward effect is of losing that client or clients?",pos,train
"Secondarily, the combination will enable us to drive efficiencies by consolidating non-investment functions such as trading and operations to continue the improvement in our margin over time",pos,train
"We believe that we've got a responsibility to our employees to share the benefit as well as to invest as much as we intelligently can to build the company for the future so we can serve all of our clients, communities and shareholders for the long term",pos,train
"I can attest that Todd is an aspiring leader, and I think all of us here at BNY Mellon agree the Clearing, Markets and Global Client Management business is in very capable hands",pos,train
"Could you talk at a high level of the money that you have earmarked? Is it technology and investments for expanding and improving your current mix of businesses? You mentioned things like alternatives and passive strategies earlier in asset management, but what I'm trying to get at is how much is current line of businesses",pos,train
"I think relative to the benefits that we would get, I think, listen, there are obviously a couple of different reasons why we spend money in the world of technology",pos,train
And so we're very focused on making the investments we need to sort of regain some of that share in some of those particular products,pos,train
"Listen, I would put a lot less -- I mean, relative to the amount of money that we're spending and the emphasis on this comment, I'd put a lot less on that, quite frankly, than on the technology piece",pos,test
"But it might -- hopefully, if we do things, it'll be things that our employees here appreciate",pos,train
"I think about it in terms of infrastructure, I think about in terms of cyber and I think about in terms of just technology development work to expand the product set that we have here or to electronify things that are done manually, and that can be both in operations functions or in businesses where we create electronic products",pos,train
"The focus that we have is on continuing to build the quality of the businesses that we have and build adjacencies where we have, and that's where the money is intended to go",pos,train
"When we sit here today, when we think about some of the things that we've got to do, we've got new leadership in there, Frank La Salla, who is laser-focused on doing the things that are necessary, which include hiring back salespeople, building out the appropriate product structure and ensuring that we do everything we can to our -- with our Corporate Trust business to leverage all the relationships that we have with those people that make the decisions on who the trustee is going to be",pos,train
"When we meet in March, we intend to review how the parts of our company work together to provide a unique value to our clients, how we will use technology to drive our business forward, what we intend to do to continue our drive for efficiency as well as actions we will take to strengthen and streamline our infrastructure",pos,train
"We're focused on building our client franchise, supported by strong and innovative products, and our business is categorized by long sales cycles with relationships that last multiples longer",pos,train
We're continuing to invest in the business to regain our share and are seeing some green shoots to progress,pos,train
"I mean, I think, when we think about expanding the product set that we have, whether it's improving or building adjacencies, sometimes the things that you do support the price you have in the marketplace and make you competitive when you're sitting in front of a client",pos,train
"And still, there are third times when there are things that you can charge for because clients directly see the benefit of something and are willing to pay for it, and we've got examples of each",pos,test
"To further our progress in wealth management, we will continue to grow our client-facing teams and continue to improve our technology platform to provide a better client interface and analytics, including mobile capabilities",pos,train
"In order to maintain momentum, we will continue to develop client solutions in alternative and passive strategies to meet our clients' needs",pos,train
When we think about how we invest inside the company and how we invest outside of the company and just -- I've been critical of things here and I've been supportive of things,pos,train
"I used the word -- when we look at the different criteria that we look at for these things and I talked about hurdles, I mean, we're clearly making a decision whether we're investing inside the company, whether investing on acquisition or we're buying our stock back",pos,train
"Those are all investment decisions, and we look at what all of those things return on behalf of the shareholder over the long term",pos,train
"We think there's tremendous opportunity so we would love to spend -- to build if it has the right returns, but those returns have to be better than returning it to you and what you could do with that",pos,test
So returning to shareholders is part of the criteria that we will continue to use to evaluate that option versus doing other things with the capital,pos,train
We're also looking into making things smoother and connecting our multiple -- our domestic and our global collaterals so clients can easily and seamlessly move collateral around the globe,pos,train
"That would be a unique capability that we can offer, and we think that should build greater adoption",pos,train
"And so I mean, I would expect -- the way we'd think about is that it's a little less than $250 million, but that would be additions to the infrastructure spend, the cyber spend and the core development spend that we have at the company",pos,train
"So just wanted to tease out, does that mean that, once we get through the next 12 months, that there will be less pressure on investment and, therefore, more benefit from taxes? And then on top of that, maybe the payout rate begins to kick in from those investments and we should see improved returns",pos,train
"I mean, you said that was post -- or includes the tech investment spend, but are you including all targets in that? Because I mean the way we're looking at it, expense base could be going up by 5%, if you include those additional charges, including the reinvestment of the taxes",pos,train
"In addition, we intend to meaningfully increase the amount we spend on technology",pos,train
"75% of our company is a technology-based processing business and 25% is investment management, where technology will continue to become a more important tool for success",pos,test
"Our technology will define our future, and we need to ensure we're investing to create the highest quality infrastructure and a platform which allows us to both drive significant efficiencies in the future as well as be agile enough to allow us to move quickly as we expand our product offerings",pos,train
We are well into this journey and seek to accelerate the effort,pos,train
"And then just, I guess, longer -- maybe bigger picture, as you invest in the business -- and I know we'll get a lot more clarity on Investor Day, but how are you thinking about this in terms of positioning versus your trust bank peers? Obviously, they're going through spend programs",pos,train
There are hundreds of discrete things that are embedded in there that we could decide to delay or go forward with in the time frame that we're planning for,pos,train
"So -- and then relative to the rest of the expense base, as I said in the comments, I think we're going to continue to be very, very prudent about watching everything else that we spend",pos,test
"I would say and I think this is a -- as we've been thinking about Investor Day, one of the things that we hope to spend a fair amount of time on is to talk about the uniqueness of the Bank of New York Mellon franchise",pos,train
We talk about what we can do to strengthen the walls around the company and the monitoring and protection process inside the company,pos,train
"We're spending a tremendous amount more on infrastructure, a great deal of which provides us with a platform to create more efficiencies and to create a different kind of product set than we have today",pos,train
"And so when it comes to an infrastructure spend, very, very hard to put specifics around that",pos,train
"We have 3 entities that are relatively subscale who we think we can drive significant benefits by creating more scale both internally in terms of the things that we spoke about, the efficiencies in the back office and the trading operations and things like that, but also how we present ourselves to clients in the consulting community",pos,train
Or would you be keeping -- would you be looking to keep more to the divi where it is today and reinvest that as well?,pos,test
"We do want to make sure that we've got the right kind of infrastructure, right risk resiliency, but, certainly, to build products and to create an environment here where we can continue to gain more efficiencies",pos,train
We would expect to be in a position to provide more commentary around our growth opportunities then as well,pos,train
"But I think the more interesting things that we do as a company and the more people in that space understand how what they're doing impacts what we can do as a company, we become an even more important place to work",pos,train
"Well, you said a couple of different things in there, and so I'll make just a couple of comments, which is, first of all, as we look at our performance in terms of where we're going in 2018 -- I want to make sure that at least there's some degree of clarity on this comment, which is we still expect to see operating leverage improvements next year even with this additional technology spend",pos,train
"So when we talk about the way we're thinking about spending, you and I both know that you don't make these commitments on, what is today, January 18 and put yourself in a position not to be able to do something about it",pos,train
"We believe that the first call should be on building the appropriate capital base for the company; second should be on organically investing inside the company when those investments meet the appropriate hurdles; thirdly, acquisitions if they meet the same criteria; and lastly, return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks",pos,train
"The biggest piece of this was severance, which is part of a broad-based effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness across the company",pos,train
"So I think, as Charlie said, I think it would be a mix where part of it is making sure we stay competitive to keep growing and service the clients we've got and then part of it will be things that we can expressly charge for",pos,train
"We do invest in the bank on life insurance, and we also have some tax exempts on -- in there as well",pos,train
So I think deposit growth and capital build become the two real pacing metrics that we’re trying to work within as we manage balance sheet growth,pos,train
"That business is modeled, is built and modeled to expand very nicely and its going to have we believe favorable operating leverage as they progress",pos,train
I believe it’s a good transaction for us and I think we'll be able to redeploy the proceeds into businesses that we more directly control and are much more in line with our wealth and trust and private banking sweet spot,pos,test
"The Anchor transaction represents a continued simplification of the BPFH business model and allows us to focus attention and resources on our Wealth Management, Trust and Private Banking businesses",pos,train
What you guys see - what are the plans for that excess capital once that deal is done?,pos,train
"One of things we’re looking at is how do we reshape the capital stake, we got to deploy that for added loan growth you saw us take the dividend up",pos,train
"As I reflect on the year, the thing I'm most heartened by, at the start of the year we telegraphed that we’re going to try to embrace a more ambitious growth formula unifying our wealth and private banking business",pos,train
And I guess as a follow up to that I mean does that change sort of the math or the calculus around your valuation some of the other subsidiaries now that they’re effectively dropping more to the bottom line?,pos,train
We’re trying to deploy ourselves to drive something more like 10% balance sheet growth in general,pos,train
"The 8% to 10% interval is something I’ll standby but our plan for 2018 is to try to push our favored loan categories, we love the resi mortgage business",pos,test
Alex I wouldn’t read into Anchor moves on our other affiliates not trying to be coy but we evaluate the economics of each one of our affiliates continuously,pos,train
"Anchor is a high quality asset, high quality firm but our ability to add a lot of value to that firm as they try to build their own AUM frankly was limited",pos,train
And that team just continues to make really good progress building the business,pos,train
Where are we in that process and what’s the reasonable goal for 2018?,pos,train
Bill will address our current pension and OPEB liabilities and provide additional details regarding the changes that we are making,pos,test
"We'll reevaluate that as we go into 2019, and that will be based on what market prices look like and what cash generation looks like",pos,train
"So again, in the second half, assuming the cash flows are strong, we'll be making those decisions around capital return, and we will let you know",pos,test
"Yes, so essentially, we've done everything we can to put those two lines into as good a shape for restart as we possibly can",pos,train
"And in fact, that was part of our reasoning behind the lockout, is that we wanted to make sure that the instability in the line that there has been through these negotiations, we control it and we prepare it for restart best we can",pos,train
"So while we can do it as easily as possible, it takes some time, and it does cost some money",pos,train
Here's a brief update on some of our value creation return-seeking capital projects,pos,train
"Spending on most capital projects occurs over multiple years, so we've honed in on projects reaching substantial completion in 2017 and 2018",pos,train
"So to reduce this liability and to strengthen the balance sheet, beginning in 3 years, salaried employees in the U",pos,train
"With a stronger balance sheet and portfolio, we can continue to invest in our businesses through the cycle while holding ourselves accountable to operate our portfolio to maximize our cash generation",pos,train
"This past quarter, we continued to aggressively execute on our strategic priorities to reduce complexity, drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet",pos,train
"After completing these payments, we plan to split any excess cash above our targeted $1 billion cash balance between further delevering the balance sheet and returns to shareholders through either dividends or stock buybacks",pos,train
I was wondering if there's a specific leverage target including the pension liabilities closer to today's news around the defined benefit pension plan as to when if you would change that allocation on excess cash above that $1 billion?,pos,train
"However, unless they fix their supply versus demand issue and stop generating a surplus, they're going to continue to see those inventories increase",pos,train
"In 2018, we will remain steadfast in our priorities, continuously identifying savings, profit drivers and new ways to strengthen the balance sheet",pos,train
"We always operate within our 3 stated values with the end goal of building a stronger Alcoa, one that is resilient through market cycles, provides our stockholders with a financial return and allows all stakeholders to succeed",pos,train
"In terms of either buybacks or dividends, past the second half of this year, I think what he was trying to get at is like we get into 2019, is that something if you do more specials that every quarter you look at it and do it the next quarter? Or is it going to be once a year? Or how will that play out, I think, just the starting of it in the second half of the year?",pos,train
Cash flow uses reflect both the increase in minimum funding requirements for pension and the discretionary payments of $300 million,pos,train
"And on the bauxite side, it means that we make a very strong business case for our customers to consider and to pay for the bauxite supplies that we can supply to them",pos,train
"However, I think it is a competitive advantage that Alcoa has in both our bauxite and alumina businesses",pos,test
"However, there are positive developments in China as demand grows strongly, supply reform continues into the new year, including with today's announcement, and economics continue to apply pressure to supply",pos,train
"So as you know, we try and incorporate our expectation for likely restarts and likely new capacities come online, and we are aware that there are a number of new refineries that have been under construction and that will be coming online",pos,train
"So we try and take a pretty balanced view and, in fact, do a refinery by refinery review to try to see what we really think is credibly possible to restart or to be turned -- brought online",pos,train
"We fundamentally believe that today, with the leverage that we have between the debt and the underfunded pension and OPEB liability, that our WACC is suboptimal, and that it could be further optimized by paying down either the pension deficit or a part of the debt",pos,train
"And if we were to ballpark it, I would suggest to you that probably $750 million to $1 billion of debt and OPEB -- I'm sorry, debt and pension reduction would be the optimal capital structure for us at this point in the cycle so -- I'm not counting the $300 million towards that",pos,train
So we typically ramp up the projects during the course of the year and spend more in the second half,pos,train
"Throughout 2017, we focused on three simple objectives, to reduce complexity, drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet",pos,train
"Buttressed by our key objective to drive returns for our stockholders, we completed and initiated capital projects that will strengthen our 3 product-focused businesses",pos,train
"And as part of our goal to reduce complexity, and perhaps our most visible change, we decided to move our global headquarters back to Pittsburgh",pos,train
It demonstrates our commitment to a smaller overhead structure and a clear-sided focus on profitable and successful operations,pos,train
"Next, as mentioned on the prior page, we expect to spend roughly $300 million to sustain our asset base and current operations and invest $150 million in return-seeking capital projects to drive value creation",pos,train
"With that example in mind, we expect that this program will continue next winter in the other targeted provinces as well",pos,train
"You know we like to keep $1 billion of cash just for the strength of the balance sheet, so we'll watch it come in during the course of the year",pos,test
"And if we make a return to shareholders, it will be in the second half",pos,train
They do feel compelled to say that we are likely to have other opportunities to create market extensions or filling in our footprint,pos,train
"It has been and it continues to be my strong belief that the revenue potential in the BNC footprint is very strong, particularly as we build out the C&I platform and leverage our wealth management businesses there",pos,train
"Nevertheless, we intend to take advantage of the outperformance that we’re likely to have on the other three components to enable to still operate in the high-end of the ROAA target range until we muscle build lead generation capability in the BNC footprint",pos,train
"That said, it is important to realize that our balance sheet produces outsider’s growth, which continue to produce ongoing positive traction for our revenues in the future",pos,test
"This obviously excites us as we go into 2018 with the combined firm, pressing forward to grow our franchise",pos,train
"Also, like many firms, we’re considering several items as investments from the Tax act in order to reward associates, as well as provide a placeholder or award shift [ph] to build a better firm quicker",pos,test
"We're considering increase the match for our K plan, as well as providing more funds to enhance our infrastructure and accelerate both client attraction and new hires",pos,train
"So, you can see the growth in the tangible capital of the company, which again will try to light into the risk-based capital there, and so if you are in 2017 as an example, we grow the tangible book value 18%, you know maybe you do 15% is something like that, but the point is, as you are growing your capital base, you can generally run the CRE growth rate at a similar percentage and so I don't view it to be a meaningful constraint, I’m not saying we don't have to pay attention toward any of that count, but I would not view it to be a meaningful constraint on loan volume, but Harold you want to comment on the [indiscernible]",pos,train
I think the second thing I always try to hit on in these calls is our aggressive hiring plan,pos,train
"That’s a really important thing in addition to hiring the revenue producers we hired, and the support staff that are needed to support those people and get all of that done inside our operating targets for expenses to assets and so forth, I think will help people understand how we drive our revenue growth and efficiencies going forward",pos,train
"The - I think we have got a lot of calls during the quarter about raising rates the - about 25% of our interest-bearing deposits are on our sheet rates, so we do negotiated rates for about 75% of our funding book",pos,train
"Again, my expectation is, we will be building throughout 2018 towards that level well and again the confidence that we have in Rick Callicutt and hiring momentum that needs to establish we’ve already talked about, 164 C&I bankers over a five-year period of time",pos,train
"We are focused on taking advantage of the large high-growth markets that we are in, and we are focused on taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of large regional and national franchises that dominate these markets",pos,train
"We will do that again before we - at the end of the year enter into the M&A phase, but again we always want to make sure that no body walks away [indiscernible] just told me that he is going back another acquisition after he prints one more quarter that’s really not what I'm saying, I don't care whether we make an acquisition or not, the growth potential is strong without it, but I do think as a practical matter we will have those opportunities",pos,train
"And so, I think in our case we’re roughly 80% shred business, balance sheet growth is really the key to the revenue growth going forward",pos,train
"So, there is still some work going on there, but I would say that our pipelines would feel solid as we go into the first quarter and we expect that good loan demand in the first quarter",pos,train
"Again those weren't exclusively rural markets by definition, but they were underperforming markets, some of which would might fit that description and so again that will be an influence on growth rates as well, but on the, in your comment about transition in the rural footprint, we don’t have an initiative to focus on candidly, you know how we take this, whatever it is, 1% or 2% of rural franchise and develop initiatives to optimize that to be honest with you, we’re looking to Rick Callicutt and his team and I have a high degree of confidence that when he overlays the staffing methodology that we use the larger legal limits that we have and bolting on the C&I business that it will transform the growth rate on both sides of the balance sheet in that footprint",pos,train
"We - I would say pay down is in the fourth quarter or very high and it’s concentrated I think more in commercial real estate than C&I and as you know the permanent markets are wide on lot of alternatives, a 30-year fixed non-recourse kinds of paper out there for commercial real estate",pos,train
"This is exactly the game that we will be playing throughout the BNC footprint, try to indicate the success that we’ve had in hiring revenue producers and as a sir component of that C&I financial advisors thus far, which again we believe we will translate into balance sheet growth and revenue growth just as we have in Chattanooga and Memphis",pos,train
"Over the years, I have always talked about revenue producers, and of course revenue producers include relationship manager and broker, mortgage originator, trust administrators, and so forth, and so I think most of you know we think ourselves as a revenue growth company, and so consequently our ability to hire people is the key to that revenue growth",pos,train
"As you all know, it is a lot easier to grow earnings per share with a growing balance sheet and we think we have a great shot at doing that as we enter 2018",pos,train
"We have spent some time in several of the quarterly calls this year talking about the cultural integration, but as a reminder we conducted roughly 10 three-day orientation sessions, largely conducted by Harold and I and other key leaders in the firm, and we will finish that group buyout, we probably got four or five that we will have to do in 2018 to get all those done and completed",pos,train
"So again, we’re excited about where we are and haven’t completed the BNC integration and now able to turn our full focus to the hiring revenue producers and building the balance sheet, which is our principal revenue generation tactics",pos,train
"For those that are less familiar with our approach to market extensions and how we tried to lay our own hiring and cultural components, and then allow that to be the driver of balance sheet growth, which is the driver to revenue growth in our company",pos,test
"I did think it is important to try to make this point, you know we had nice growth in the fourth quarter, I expect the growth to be better in 2018, but I don’t see that primarily as a functional loan demand, in other words what we do for a living, primarily take market share and so my belief is that, so a good part of the growth that we’ve enjoyed thus far and I will project going forward as to move the market share from the large regional and national franchises, perhaps more than loan growth is really tied to the economic growth",pos,train
"So, over time we think the bond book restructure, we think maybe some increased yields from our loan book will be helpful, but the critical think that we have got to keep an eye on are these funding costs, and so that will be what we monitor all year long",pos,train
"So that is a long way to say, I think loan demand will pick up as a result of certainly around the tax law change, but I do think that may be muted a little bit just difficult international situation and the political discourse domestically",pos,train
"We always expect the fourth quarter to be the most difficult quarter for mortgage as December is the worst in the real estate market, but the spring is at hand and we are in great residential mortgage markets with the best mortgage originators in those markets",pos,train
"So, we remain optimistic about what residential mortgage will do in 2018",pos,test
"I might go at it this way, I think you know, we have said with no acquisition we believe we will grow to be a $28 billion asset company",pos,train
"So, the banking clients have been virtually untapped in terms of the mortgage capabilities there, and so we view that to be substantially and the second major thrust is we are hiring mortgage originators",pos,train
"David, I think we said from the very beginning that our - what the beauty of this transaction and strategy involved with it is that we want to continue the double-digit growth that BNC has enjoyed, but then both on that C&I business, and so the mix will change, but again without an effort to diminish their CRE practice",pos,train
"And so then moving across that slide you can see where we have finished 2016, where we have finished 2017, and again right there in the center the growth rates associated with our hiring and with loans and deposits, core deposits in both of those markets in the most recent year, again very strong",pos,train
"So, we are we are confident that what we are doing it is easily inside that",pos,train
"And so, to produce the balance sheet growth at those growth rates in the middle of taking on the most monumental system and operation conversion that we have ever undertaken, I think really bodes well as we move into 2018 with that now in the rearview mirror",pos,train
"So, what we're really trying to communicate was, a we’re closing those concentration limits as exacerbated by those write-downs, and so it may take a few quarters for us to rebuild the equity back associated with those write-downs and so that’s the phenomenal and that we’re talking about there what was - and we may temporarily breach those guidelines, but late in the year we ought to have produced enough capital to get back inside those guidelines",pos,train
"But I do think when I - if I make those points, I do detect in some people a skepticism or maybe better said, the concern that the bill now is going to grab the expense levels too high and so I guess I just want to reiterate that we intend to get this hiring done inside the expense to asset targets that we set",pos,train
"We would expect that generally to continue, but we expect to really augment that with building out the C&I platform as we’ve already talked and hired a good number of bankers in the last half of 2017, and they are off to a great start in 2018",pos,train
"One other clarification on that point, even though we definitely talked about all the revenue producers there is no doubt in the North Carolina footprint that really the exponential growth we expect to achieve there has to do with continuing the growth rates that they have enjoyed for a long time in the commercial real estate business, but really adding to that a C&I practice, that’s substantial and so we have communicated in the past, within this category revenue producers that we intend to add 64 C&I or private banking financial advisors over a five-year period of time",pos,train
"And again, we will continue to report on that so you can see our progress on that because of the strategic importance of that initiative",pos,train
Many of such factors are beyond Pinnacle Financial’s ability to control or predict and listeners are cautioned not to put undue reliance on such forward-looking statements,pos,train
"And so, as Paul mentioned earlier, in the Wealth Management business, we moved pricing up because people with $10 million in investment assets whether it’s obviously check the cash in their accounts as an investment as it is opposed to in the retail business it be there will daily flow",pos,train
"So, the ability to accelerate those investments are largely based on what we think we can do that will be modest in a sense that, even a step of fair increase and the margin is not a big number in the overall scheme of things at the $53 billion expense level",pos,train
"At the end of the day, our challenge is to drive operating leverage and we continue to do that within 12 quarters in a row and we’ll continue to do that going forward and that’s good for shareholders",pos,train
"They are all prime, core transaction accounts of the household which means the pay checks coming in – that’s what’s driving the overall structure of the business and we’ll continue to do so",pos,test
That’s a key thing that we are looking at all the time and holding people accountable to in addition to efficiency and all the other individual metrics across mobile adoption and digital sales,pos,train
"So, yes, our targets will be obtained, but that doesn’t lower our desire to drive responsible growth and continue to improve the company and continue to improve the returns and return of capital to you and we’ll continue to do that",pos,train
We expect these benefits over the medium-term to drive efficiencies that will help us offset inflationary cost and potentially increases in investments,pos,train
"So we continue to evaluate options for longer term value creation along the dimensions of the investments we have been making in branches, in technology and people",pos,train
"But if you think about the core pretax margins, it will move up and they can get it, we still believe we can get up around 30 in the deposit side helps us that as the arbitrage from rates goes through that business",pos,train
"We had a good 2017 and we look forward to a great 2018 and we can do that by driving responsible growth, delivering value for our customers and for you our shareholders and we continue to do that",pos,train
"That’s going to increase our profits and so, we are going to be in a better position to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks",pos,test
"Focusing on client balances, on the bottom of the page, you can see the success we’ve continued to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets",pos,train
"Are you still reinvesting cost saves, but you are still taking out cost some places, reinvesting other, as you think about 2019 and beyond, is $53 billion kind of where you want to be or should we think about an efficiency ratio set of goals for the next year, is that a better way to think about it?",pos,test
We just see tremendous opportunity to keep applying digitization to paper and the work in the company and continue to drive that,pos,train
"So, a lot of the – some of those investments will be branches or people or sales people and have been and the businesses, but on the other hand we are investing tremendously in the effectiveness in the company and we’ll continue to do that",pos,train
"So we as a team are proud of the outcome today for sure, but even more proud that we are approving, that we can win and do it the right way through driving responsible growth and we plan to do that in the future",pos,train
"But as we look forward, we have no doubt, as I said earlier that business is including our company, we’ll have to look to take advantage of some of the tax savings to invest and improve their business and compete as faster as they would have done before the tax reform act",pos,train
"I mean, is there a big opportunity to do investments? I know you said you give further details later on as you look across, maybe pull forward some investments and lower expenses, but it seems like, if you were to go and some kind of accelerated investment, maybe there will be a chance to get below that $53 billion in expenses in 2019 and is that’s still possibly something you're actively pursuing?",pos,train
"That being said, those customers justice we at Bank of America will look and our other peers in our industry are carefully evaluating alternatives to reinvest some portion of those savings to drive further business activities to help grow our company and achieve even more competitiveness",pos,train
"Again, I would remind everybody that we are focused on prime and super prime and we didn’t follow the market out to extended durations but we are still holding our own there and expect slight modest growth next year",pos,test
Negative news reports on that company caused significant market concerns which affected the credit spreads and stock price of this formerly investment grade credit,pos,train
"So, as we continue to get customers to adapt these new and exciting technologies, we’ll see more operating leverage, but it’s been – the team has done a great job there, and I think they’ll continue to improve it",pos,train
"So, we will continue to drive that, but I think, yes, we have invested, but it’s not necessary what we’ve done for this year, it’s $1 billion we probably invested in mobile technology over the last five, six years to get us here that now we are taking advantage of it and as you know it comes out the Merrill Edge capabilities continue to be improved to helping that affluent – mass affluent America",pos,test
"Likewise, you are going to see some of the transformation we are doing in the wealth management business continue to grow and Terry and Andy and Katy and the team are doing a great job",pos,train
"We need to – that business is growing, but we need to start to drive some of the digitization techniques that we use in other businesses including commercial business into that business which we’ll see and that will help the operating leverage there",pos,train
"The question that we have to look at, Betsy as you reference is, is there an amount of investment that we may accelerate some of the things we are doing especially around consumer business but across all the business to accelerate the branch build out and some of the cities that’s proven to be very successful that we are doing over five years you want to speed it up a little bit",pos,train
"So we are going to be driving that analysis that says, how much can we invest and build this operational excellence campaign we’re on",pos,train
"The answer is we’ll drive that number as high as we can driving responsible growth and as we start to get rid of more equity than we earn, because we have excess equity that will help, we continue to improve the earnings that will help us drive operating leverage all the things you cited will help",pos,test
"We just don’t know though, what all I can tell you is that we are going to balance our customer needs and we are going to balance the competitive marketplace with our shareholders interest and we are going to do the right thing for all the parties",pos,train
"Well, I think, the efficiency ratio and the team tell us they are going to get it, - they have done the 50 and they are going to get below 50 and they take great solace in that",pos,train
"Brian, you talked about efforts to invest in technology to drive improved profitability",pos,train
"With the slight caveat that people are repatriating some funds, so we are going to see what a factor is in the short-term on really our large corporate international kind of borrowers",pos,train
"On a more – at a more detail level, we feel like we’ve been growing well in mortgage and we are going to – that will be offset by home equity run-off",pos,train
"And we will look at, as I said and we’ll look at across time, you have to be able to get the value of those investments",pos,train
I think it is – mechanically there is some things to help us over the next couple years in terms of some stuff running that pushes this up,pos,test
"So, to the extent that you want to get as competitive on deposit rates, I mean there is still plenty of opportunity to remix from short-term into loans?",pos,test
"As we noted during the reviews of previous quarters, clients started to more oppressively move deposits into cash investment alternatives within AUM and brokerage starting early in the year",pos,train
"So wrapping that up, we will stay focused on responsible growth in 2018",pos,test
"Compared to Q3 2017, NII increased $300 million driven by loans, securities, and asset growth in global markets, as well as a run up of short-end rates in anticipation of the FED funds cut and the deferrals",pos,train
So our growth will have to be organic and will continue to be so,pos,train
We believe we have sufficient capital to absorb our risk as we grow and in fact we have excess capital,pos,test
We have the capital also to support our customers’ demand for financing and we always want to use that capital first to help customers grow,pos,train
There is new more investments here because we have leveled the playing field,pos,train
"We will continue to drive operational excellence, lowering operational expenses as we’ve done for many quarters in a row and improving our competitiveness as we develop and invest in new products and services",pos,test
So you just have to put the money to work and we put it into an investment portfolio to extract the value that creates deposit franchise,pos,train
"But it be very modest and a greater context lot of investments get capitalized with the near term P&L impacts differ but basically from a conceptual framework, we think we can run the company in the low $53 billion approximate $1 billion on a consistent basis over the next couple of years with a caveat that we may look to invest part of the tax savings on top of that and we’ll be very clear when we do that",pos,test
"We would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance in support of loan growth, those releases are being driven by non-core consumer real estate and energy",pos,train
"We are going to remain focused on driving responsible growth, continually trying to connect that with our customers, striving to make it easier for those customers to do business with us and for our employees to do business inside the company",pos,train
That’s – if we just drive this company the same way and it will come out to be higher now and we will see those levels and we expect to continue to see it,pos,train
"And secondly, there is a lot of paper in this business and lot of work and even advice themselves there is a lot of automation work they do that will make that easy for them do that, they could become more efficient, handle more clients and handle them well",pos,train
"Yes, I think, we want to focus all of you across all the business operating leverage and they tend to – they’ve shown good progress at the company as a whole and each of the businesses and consumer can continually get operating leverage",pos,train
"I think the – as we said before, the key is to drive operating leverage as Betsy referenced John and continue to drive across the businesses",pos,train
", continuing to invest in operational improvement over time and keeping it relatively flat",pos,train
The question is will they pay it on our loans and perhaps they will,pos,train
"However in the medium to long-term, more after tax cash flow came from real estate business and we will benefit by greater loan growth as those businesses invest those proceeds",pos,train
"We will invest a little bit more in technology especially to make the next major move in the markets businesses which Tom and the team are driving at to get the – even with stable revenues to start to drive the profit back up again, or in treasury services business",pos,test
"So, the debate is, is there some amount that you’d invest to help accelerate growth whether it be along the dimensions that we’ve been doing and will just improve our ability to get them done and speed it up it would be modest I think, is the best way to say",pos,test
What we told you guys is we got to $53 billion for 2018 be relatively flat thereon absorbing 6% medical care cost increases raises and things like that and that comes through ability to continue to investment effectiveness and efficiency,pos,test
"So, we don’t –that’s an operating strategy level and exact number that we are focused on and we continue to focus on that",pos,train
And we think companies are going to be interested in more M&A transactions and ultimately are going to be investing in raising capital,pos,train
"In addition, the investments we make will drive operational excellence and efficiencies that will continue to play to our benefit over time",pos,train
"I guess the key one is going to be on visibility at the -- of the customer that you said, the Tier 1 domestic customer",pos,train
"And Tom on the upside, if you can remind us, there’s a new project you spoke about and I know there’s customer sensitivity, but at DT or at least the big non-U",pos,train
"So that 100-meg, in that 100-meg scenario that if the customer in the targeted scenarios, they won’t have to necessarily go to fiber, they could continue to deploy the VDSL vectoring albeit perhaps on a more targeted basis, is that accurate?",pos,train
"com and following the Investor Relations link to take advantage of user-friendly resources, such as interactive financials to provide additional insight into our performance",pos,train
"We continue to have a broad breadth of opportunities ahead of us, demonstrated by announced wins in deployments by leading carriers such as MDN and DT, and in 2017 we brought in well over 40 new infrastructure customers",pos,train
"We have some specific lab dates that we need to meet in both this quarter and the next quarter, and we would expect that to pick up in the-- we would expect to see shipments really kind of potentially starting in the second half",pos,train
Tier 1 opportunity or is that really the first one to focus on and it will rollout from there to other carriers after that one?,pos,train
"I mean, that’s a very difficult question, so let me try to roll that back, because there are some Tier 2 carriers in there today, of that Tier 2s can actually meaningfully move the number and that’s not just in the U",pos,train
"I would say in aggregate though, I take the Tier 1s out, they have the potential to spend as much as the Tier 1 definitely",pos,train
We have introduced developmental breakthroughs with our Gigabit-to-the-Basement and millimeter wave backhaul and access solutions designed specifically to help carriers realize the opportunities created by the ramp-up to 5G,pos,train
"Some of those balance sheets, I think, are becoming more stressed, I mean, as you think about the full year with those kinds of customers, I mean, do you think they would be flat, up, down for the year, how do you sort of think about them going forward? Thanks",pos,train
Our carrier win in Australia will ramp up in Q2,pos,test
"Our Mosaic platform has quickly become the centerpiece of the Mosaic Open Network Alliance, where member companies are collaborating on SDN and NFV solutions that will underpin a new approach to access",pos,train
"And so there is that potential that that would kick in towards the end of this quarter, but what you said makes sense to me, which is, if there is very little activity in Q1, we would expect more activity in Q2",pos,train
"So how should we think about growth in memory revenues in calendar '18, and is there a potential risk that if customers decide to scale back on capital spending if the pricing environment does not support such a situation? And I have a follow-up",pos,train
"In addition to strong demand from existing customers in the region, we're also planning to ship to five domestic Chinese customers in 2018 for both memory and logic applications",pos,train
"The faster they can do that and the better they can do that, the more we can squeeze out because everything else a long list of items in terms of buildings, machines, people, training, the whole thing, that will not happen until 2020, and our outlook to 2020, which is their outlook 2019",pos,train
And that also means we are very transparent to our customers on the 2019 potential shipment plan and when those machines become available,pos,train
"This ramp I think also if you look at the comments made by our customers and their assessment of the size of the nodes, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they -- that there is an indication that those nodes will actually dwindle in terms of number of wafers that they would need to build that capacity",pos,train
"Like I said earlier, we look at the memory and the logic business; we see 2018 developing at least at the same level as 2017 for both logic and memory with some upside here and there",pos,train
And that is also when we look at next year we see sales increase in logic really driven by EUV and memory sales increase is driven by DUV,pos,test
"In 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong as a number of customers continue to ramp new greenfield fabs as scaled vertically which all fall stack-of-stacks",pos,train
"EUV production ramp will accelerate in 2018 as customers are eager to realize the benefits of process simplification, cycle time reduction, a yield improvement, and ultimately resulting in cost benefits",pos,train
"How long would it take for ZEISS to add additional capacity? Do you have any flexibility to accelerate investment there or accelerate capacity -- manufacturing capacity so that your 30 plus target for 2019 could increase? And I am asking you this because if you are able to increase confidence among your DRAM customers that you can actually do 200 wafer per day, wouldn't it need to place a PO before '19 and wouldn't some of these EUV shipment will have to take place into DRAM customer by late '19? So doesn't that create a kind of a double sword? And I want to get your view on the kind of lever that you can pull to accommodate these DRAM customers",pos,train
"So, we will go through the year and the more important thing is it will be a good step forward towards the 50-plus in 2020, and that's really what we are working for",pos,train
"No, because the stack is we need to [indiscernible] 125 wafers, so where we get over 250, once we get more wafers out there, we get extra money, but 125 wafers is what we sold about",pos,train
They're going to ramp up with the same speed as the mature memory companies,pos,train
"So, all of them will have an extra amount of money to be build to the customer once you get up to 251, because that's beyond the spec, right?",pos,test
"So, the supply situation is what it is, and I think the 30-plus is limited, as we said before, by the supply chain, and the 40-plus is really when the supply chain can kick into the next step, so no real change",pos,train
High NA one obviously goes through our R&D line and also through our balance sheet as it relates to the CapEx,pos,train
"But as it relates to the equity investment, you will see that equity method investment on the balance sheet of about €1 billion for the 24",pos,train
And in NAND the capacity addition of what we can see based on litho will be around mid-40s,pos,train
"But also, there are specific requirements that we need to put to those drive tools because there are peculiarities, I could say, with 3D NAND manufacturing which have to do with wafers, which have to do with opaque layers so that the alignment needs to be different",pos,train
"And all those specific peculiarities of 3D NAND will be addressed by us by brining out tools and options on the tools that will enable our customers to increase their yields, and to make sure that they can do effective 3D NAND production",pos,train
"And the second thing that you see is in our cash flow from investing, you see that dividend that's attributed to that investment",pos,train
"And going forward we will do that, because if you look at what our customers really want from us is node-to-node transitions",pos,train
And node-to-node transitions going forward are really a combination of the entire set of products and services that we are offering,pos,train
"Yes, I think we actually mentioned that €3 billion mark, but that takes into account, I think, our view as to the speed -- the realistic speed with which our domestic Chinese customers will be able to ramp their fabs and to get their products qualified",pos,train
"But I would suspect that the majority -- I think the significant majority of everything that we will ship in 2019 will be booked in 2018, because the cycle time reductions will really take effect later, and that will then have an affect on the order lead time of our customers, so vast majority should be in this year",pos,train
But generally I would say that the drive DUV systems are going up in numbers going forward,pos,train
"So that target of 1,500 to 2,000 wafers per day, that is what we are focusing on, and that seems very feasible with everything we have on the table we have today, which I think is evidenced by the fact that customers are giving us orders, and we got 10 orders in Q4",pos,train
"The way we look at this is, are we creating an overcapacity in terms of the bit supply into the memory market, both DRAM and on NAND",pos,train
"If we take that, and we take into account that the nodes that they want to use [indiscernible], the effect it will have on the bit density, then we can calculate what the capacity addition will be in terms of bits",pos,train
The wholesale business is a great way of introducing new consumers to Burberry who go into department stores as you know and therefore we want to retain the partnerships with the wholesalers,pos,train
"What we’re doing is having the dialogue about how we want to position the brand, where we want the point of sale to be in the department store, which floor, what are the adjacencies? And those discussions are going well but obviously it takes time to do this",pos,train
"So yes, the major cities are the area we’re focused",pos,train
"We’ve got eight in line with our first wave and we’re progressing that according to – but it’s the major cities where the big influences are in terms of Bond, New York, et cetera, LA",pos,test
So it’s just the titration of the space as we move in some cases to more elevated positions which is our intension as part of the strategy,pos,train
"In November, we set out our plan to establish our position firmly in luxury by reenergizing our product, communication and customer experience",pos,train
"So clearly the fact that tops, bottoms, trousers, skirts performing well but clearly they are and intend to be a lower price point than something like a trench coat or a bag both of which are categories where you’ll see more innovation coming in the future rather than in next quarter",pos,train
What we were doing is obviously giving analysts and investors more of an insight into the 2% comp by referring to the product mix which had impacted the AUR and I think that’s what you’re finding the press will pick up on,pos,train
"The brand is very strong, so we decided to reduce promotional activity and that impacted our – for the spend at home local Chinese results",pos,train
"We’ve already sold close to 200 roles ahead of our plan enabling the center to deliver elements of work across five major functions and some of our core end-to-end processes including purchase to pay, sales order to cash and hire to retire",pos,train
So you mentioned the doodle sketch and we will be continuing to refresh the outerwear range coming in from March,pos,train
We are finding generally that newest innovation is what is driving the consumer and the market and certainly the range in terms of puffers and quilts to do very well in this quarter also,pos,train
But the main emphasis that we’ve got is really around the start of the new product range and it’s building out the offering over time,pos,train
He leaves the board at the end of March and will continue to support us as needed throughout 2018,pos,train
So we would expect over the course of the plan to reduce our own promotional activity,pos,train
"So yes, I think over time you’re going to see us reduce promotional activity in line with the changes we’re making from non-luxury elements to the distribution channel",pos,train
There is a lot of work to do but we are pleased with the early progress we’ve made and we remain focused on our goal of positioning Burberry firmly in luxury and delivering long-term sustainable shareholder value,pos,train
"The key thing with the handbags is we want to build out a full sort of architecture of handbags so that we’re looking at different functions, different usage; so day, evening; different sizes; different functionalities",pos,train
"And if you look at those lines, you're going to see that with the - when you take a look at the assets and liabilities that are really clearly associated with our trading business, just a little over - the trading liabilities fund, just a little bit over half of the level of assets that we employ in our trading business",pos,train
"Some of the things that you can see if you go to our website and our offerings, you'll see that we have already begun to alter some of the offerings that we've put out",pos,train
"One is that continuing to walk the dividend up so that from a current yield perspective, the dividend remains competitive amongst our peers and dedicating the vast majority of our capital return capacity or capabilities towards buyback",pos,train
"And as I said, we're always open and we're always looking at things",pos,train
"And there's an element of that, that is going to be just difficult to predict because it's related to changes in trading strategies and balance sheet structure, et cetera",pos,test
"I think there's nothing really outside of what we've described, but a big emphasis towards digital, towards technology, towards new and smart banking as we go forward and then, obviously, continued investments in place like our TTS businesses and all the things that we've talked about",pos,train
"Yes, Mike, if you - again, if you do the math on that 20 - on the 200 basis point improvement, it should drive you to an ROA that is somewhere well north of the midpoint of that range that we gave you, a little-- so think about it as being moving towards the upper end of that range of 90 to 110 basis points…",pos,train
"We're revising the return targets we provided in July accordingly and don't plan on speaking to RoTCE, excluding DTA, when we discuss the returns going forward",pos,train
"And where opportunities present themselves around portfolios with different types of bolt-ons that are in strategy, we're wide open",pos,train
"So growth in interest-earning, shrinking, declining in the promo balances, and then there's going to be the other aspects of cards that sort of balance along underneath that",pos,train
We continue to be confident in our acquisition strategy and believe the investments we're making today will generate revenue growth as these balances mature,pos,train
And corporate clients are different from investor clients because corporate clients are in the market every day because they really have to hedge their overall balance sheet,pos,train
"And candidly, at this point in time, I don't think we're all that keen about taking on big branch infrastructure that - we've got infrastructure in our consumer business",pos,train
And I think we'd rather take that same investment as we're doing and channel it towards digital and other things where we can get growth organically,pos,train
And that allows us to continue to drive out costs,pos,train
"As we said before, we believe we are in a unique position to improve our return on capital while also increasing our return of capital for a powerful impact on RoTCE, and we are committed to showing you progress each year as we move forward",pos,train
"I'd say that from a medium-term point of view, John, what we're seeing now gives us confidence in those projections that we put forward for Investor Day",pos,test
And we hope and believe and are making the investment in digital and think we can continue to grow our franchise using digital rather than physical branch footprint,pos,train
"So trying to find that right balance, we're going to push ourselves, but we're going to try and make sure we don't make stupid decisions along the way in terms of getting there",pos,train
"Not only do we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital during the current and next 2 CCAR cycles, obviously subject to regulatory approval, but we feel confident about our ability to generate capital going forward",pos,train
"I'm just curious how much of it we should think of as like facilitation loans, things like Aramco, things like hedge fund leverage, which are good things, I don't want to make it like they're bad, versus a traditional corporate borrowing money and building something",pos,train
"And then, there's some additional strength coming in, in retail banking as a result of the Citi - the strong Citigold offering that we've got",pos,train
"But what we don't want to do is fall into the trap of then saying, let's accelerate that faster, and then start taking outsized growth in the form of balance sheet or other types of risks where we end up stumbling along the way",pos,train
"So on the expense side, it's continued expense discipline, but at the same time, some investments we're making today, as an example, in the digital space where we can convert analog functions to digital functions, improve customer processes and satisfaction, at the same time, get cross-sell",pos,train
"I mean, right now, our assessment is that, that benefit certainly would give us even greater confidence in those forward projections that we put out there",pos,train
"And so, again, as we talk about the opportunities out there for us, we start right here in terms of Citi",pos,train
We're continuing to see gains coming out of the investments that we're making in digital and consumer,pos,train
"But to your point, it's going to put some more pressure on those economies to attempt to become more competitive",pos,test
"So yes, there's a lot of changing dynamics in the marketplace, but we really think it boils down to being able to focus on your customers, which is why we talk about client-led revenue, to make sure that you are investing in the necessary technology, and those are the things that we're doing",pos,train
"We have - some of our products where we have offered at 21 months interest free for a balance conversion and then 21 months of interest free purchases, that would be the extreme, and then there's others where it will be 7 months of purchases interest free as we have on Costco",pos,train
We're continuing to see progress in Equities and have extended our leadership in Fixed Income in a difficult market,pos,train
"I think when you look at the fact that we're generating a 200 basis point improvement at a minimum of - to RoTCE out into the future, I still think it's a pretty good trade-off",pos,train
I'd say that there's still some process reengineering work to go through with our global functions and there's some additional work that we'll get out of our core infrastructure when - from a technology point of view,pos,train
"That is one of BlackRock’s long term strategies and that intersects with technology, that intersects with what our business in the United Sates, our business in Europe, our future business in China",pos,train
"I think it's going to be higher and higher every single year, but we're also involved in making sure that the markets operate in a very effective and efficient way",pos,train
"And also, the distribution platforms are changing themselves and becoming a lot more competitive, and when you add this along with a lot of the regulatory issues that are looking at transparency and cost, this is all going to be very, very fluid",pos,train
"The access that we are experiencing in Europe as they’ve consolidated managers for years, both in the mutual fund side and the ETF side and in the United States, the access that we're presenting and it is evident by the -- where some of the different distribution platforms are using models, they're utilizing many of BlackRock’s models in terms of the creation of ETFs and a creation of a portfolio of ETFs",pos,train
"Over the next few months, as we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock and clarify the potential for future investment opportunities, especially our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest in new products, we plan to reassess our capital management plans for the balance of 2018",pos,train
"These equity awards will vest over an extended timeframe of five to seven years and are focused on ensuring the interests of the next generational leaders, individuals who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock’s future that are aligned with both clients and shareholders much as mine and Rob have been over the last 30 years",pos,train
"So, obviously over the next few weeks, we’ll get updates from other companies as well, but I guess bigger picture, when it comes to the asset management business, how much of the tax benefit you expect the industry to retain versus how much is going to get competed away? And then when it comes to BlackRock specifically, how are you guys thinking internally about reinvesting some of these benefits, particularly when it comes to additional fee reductions?",pos,train
"We will continue to leverage our differentiating scale and invest in our technology, and invest in the value proposition for our client and importantly create a great value proposition for our shareholders",pos,train
"So we are combining our efforts, so that we can offer a spectrum of equity investments to our clients",pos,train
"But, it is also a reality that we won’t be here forever and BlackRock’s future is critical in linking and retaining what I consider the best management team in the industry",pos,train
You also have the insurance companies who have thousands and thousands of line items of portfolios that are looking to be much more efficient and also have portfolios that have more liquidity,pos,train
I do think you're going to see a lot of interest from the institutions to potentially replace some of their alternatives that will go into equities and also to take some of the cash positions they have and put them in to equity,pos,test
"As I said, 50 different countries now, broader and broader penetration and we would expect a continuation of the growth rates of 14- ish percent going forward in our technology platform",pos,train
"Once we kind of finalize the impact that tax reform is going to have on BlackRock and there's going to be lots of additional guidance that's going to be forthcoming as well as making sure that we are looking at all of the balance sheet, if you will, opportunities that we have, over the next several months, including more aggressively seeding and co-investing in new products",pos,train
"For clients looking for greater alpha potential, BlackRock is leveraging the powerful combination of our human insights and technology to deliver consistent, durable alpha",pos,train
"As I said in my prepared remarks, we’re using technology to provide better services alongside our humans to connect with our financial advisors, both the traditional ones and the RIA ones",pos,train
"I think that’s one of the big issues that’s going to confront every major developed country and it’s going to even impact a lot of developing countries, even like China",pos,test
"So one, it means continuation of – I think, this is one of the foundations why financial markets have a good fundamental foundation to it and we're seeing different -- in our LifePath products, we've extended the life of some of the LifePaths, we've extended ownership of equities longer on some of our LifePath products",pos,train
"The other area where we are bringing in more flows is working with more of the distribution platforms on providing model based products and customizing it and in those cases, much of the product flow in these model based products would be flowing into our iShares basis",pos,train
"So, I think this is just the normal process of a fund – of a product growing and figuring out better rappers and better ways to distribute that product",pos,train
"Right now, we're seeing, it starts out from trading desks on Wall Street that are using ETFs to hedge their positions",pos,train
"It's emerging markets investors, both institutional and retail that are looking to have more diversified instant access into the emerging markets area",pos,train
"However, in these times of greater certainty and economic growth, there's an even greater need to focus on investing in the long run",pos,train
"Just as we believe in the importance and benefits of clients investing for the long term to create better financial futures, we also believe in investing in BlackRock with the same future prospective",pos,train
"The combined firm brought BlackRock’s access to Mexico's wealth management, providing clients' access to BlackRock’s international products and to build a partnership to create more innovative, multi asset solutions",pos,train
"Last month, BlackRock obtained our private fund management registration, which enables us to manufacture and privately distribute onshore funds in China to qualified institutions and high net worth individuals in China",pos,train
"While past investments have shaped the BlackRock of today, we remain steadfast in our approach to investing in BlackRock’s future and we've just finished two days of meetings with BlackRock’s Board of Directors where we reviewed our strategy tactically and our long-term strategies for the future",pos,train
"And those discussions are really across the board in various types of equities and they include more procession type, whether it be smart beta or multi-asset solutions, which we’re very, very well positioned for",pos,test
Growth has also been driven by increasing adaptation by clients using ETFs in different ways as ETFs have made investing more accessible to both institutions and individuals,pos,train
"What other major investor groups are using ETFs in this manner? And I always think about the US RIA channel as sort of a big one, but outside of this group, what other investor groups and maybe even institutional channels are doing this?",pos,train
"We will continue to make investments in BlackRock’s future, to grow investment and technology capabilities, to expand our geographic footprint and to further enhance our talent so that we can ensure we meet our daily responsibility to our clients and deliver the returns to our shareholders that we all expect",pos,train
"So, there are some clients that are looking to move that increased allocation to alternatives directly into the equity market for 2018 as they have become more bullish and that's in light of all of the things that you know about, whether it be tax rates, earnings, global growth, et cetera, et cetera that they may have",pos,train
They may be able to have a bigger return in the outright equity market than they do in some of the more alternative spaces,pos,train
"And so in some respects, as those expenses go up, those are good things because it means that those contingent payments are more in the money because of the fact that those deals are doing that way",pos,train
"The importance of technology continues to increase across our platform and is intersecting with every major strategic theme we are focused on, including retirement",pos,train
We see tremendous opportunities to leverage our technology such as iRetire for example to address the ongoing global retirement challenge,pos,train
We continue to invest in technology both organically and inorganically,pos,train
"I would say, every institution we talk to has asked questions related, how they could use ETFs in their portfolio, whether that’s internally managed entirely by an institution or they have accommodations internally driven asset management and external managers, but I would say from pension funds, the sovereign wealth funds to insurance companies are all now utilizing more ETFs for strategic asset allocation purposes",pos,train
"During 2017, we continued to lay the foundation for future growth by increasing our seed and co-investment portfolio by approximately $500 million, and beyond the technology related acquisitions previously noted, announcing the acquisition of Citibanamex Asset Management furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico, and closing the acquisition of First Reserve’s energy infrastructure funds, continuing the build out of our leading illiquid alternatives platform",pos,train
"So when we combine those two with the BlackRock Investment Institute that we have that looks at both micro and macro issues in the marketplace, we think that we are going to get much better value and performance from our portfolio managers, who will have much better information both about the short term and the long term",pos,train
"And for those Central developments, we just continue to look at the balance between private sales and whether there's any opportunity in relation to bulk sales",pos,train
So I think we're definitely on the front foot in terms of land acquisition,pos,test
"And we would hope that, that would happen reasonably soon, certainly over the next 3 to 6 months",pos,train
"So given that our completion levels are 17,000 to 18,000, to be in-taking in excess of 20,000 we think is fine",pos,train
"If I pick up in terms of build cost and incentives, and Jessica will talk about land creditors",pos,train
"Well, if I just talk about the land bank, and then Jessica will talk through in terms of forward sales",pos,train
"And then finally, we want to make sure that we have comparative data so that we can definitively prove to the marketplace to the clinicians that we have a compound that's best-in-class",pos,train
"So, looking forward to a good 2018 and making sure we both deliver for shareholders, but importantly seek to solve these important for [Indiscernible] for patients",pos,train
We began the year in 2017 really beginning to move our compounds forward,pos,train
"We believe we've got multiple first or best-in-class compounds and really start to focus on getting ralinepag, etrasimod enrolled, reporting out the first data center on ralinepag, and importantly, focusing on resetting our capital structure as a company",pos,train
We began the year with a large retail shareholder base and we're excited to have strong executional support as we exit 2017 and begin 2018,pos,train
"So, really exciting data readout and really set the premise for the company in 2017 to really begin to recapitalize, reset the company, and put us on a forward footing",pos,train
"And as excited as I am about etrasimod in Q1, I'm just as excited about rolling out additional indications, getting the ralinepag Phase III study started and importantly bringing additional compounds from our -- essentially from our shelves that Arena worked on over many years forward in the cardiopulmonary space",pos,train
"With some additional data readouts with APD371 through the first half of the year and the second half of the year is really focused on initiating the ralinepag Phase III program, continue to expand the indications around etrasimod and we've got some additional cardiopulmonary assets in the company, a clinical stage and in preclinical which we intend to bring forward in the back half of the year to really build out a cardiopulmonary franchise around ralinepag",pos,train
"The objective here, of course, is to have a 24-hour unremitting exposure to the IP receptor agonist, providing IV-like exposure and we're excited because we firmly believe that ralinepag, with its long half-life and superior potency has ability to be a once-a-day oral that begins to mimic IV prostacyclin",pos,train
"As we look forward to this year, our focus is largely on a series of exciting catalysts",pos,train
"So, we think these are critical pillars of building a label and a lifecycle plan for the compound that would be -- that will allow us to fulfill the objective that we've laid out for the product",pos,train
And that's going to be driven by our ability to get the product to the market in an expeditious manner,pos,train
"Unlike the other studies that have done to-date, we will be looking in an enriched patient population, so we're using a series of registries in the U",pos,train
"As a consequence, we believe this creates broad clinical utility, the ability to take the compound into lots of different therapeutic areas over time",pos,train
"Thanks to the strength of our balance sheet and our financially flexibility, we are continuing to execute well there, beyond the business development for the ninth consecutive year",pos,train
I see as going forward continuing to work on all of those fronts,pos,train
"Moving into the future and near-term catalysts, there are four opportunities that I would like to discuss which are near-term opportunities that will be driven by data that is either in our hands or that we may see in 2018 and into 2019",pos,train
"We have significant financial flexibility as a company, a very strong balance sheet",pos,train
"There are a number of pillars which can grow, which can drive the growth of Bristol-Myers Squibb going forward",pos,test
"That program is continuing to move forward, but other data readouts are also important for us",pos,train
"The transformation of the company has indeed enabled to focus even more and better on key priorities, accelerate execution, increase investment in R&D and behind key capabilities",pos,train
"Second, we are continuing to manage expenses diligently while we are increasing investment in R&D",pos,train
"And third, as a result of our focus we can expect that our growth will translate into a meaningful expansion of our operating margins going forward",pos,train
"Another critical pillar of our strategy is innovation, and obviously that's true with respect to our focus on translation on medicines and the pipeline we are developing which is differentiated and innovative but I should say I'm quite proud of how innovation permeates the company 100% today and how well we have evolved the way we go to market interact with payers and prescribers and look at doing everything we do differently going forward",pos,test
"And just as a reminder the objective we had then was to increase the speed at which BMS operates the ability we have to invest in new capabilities, strengthen our focus on R&D, at the same time as we maintain a control on our total resources and total operating expenses",pos,train
"So finally and in conclusion, I hope I been able to convey the excitement that is in the company, coming out of 2017 year, where execution was very strong",pos,train
"The number of important pillars to our growth story beginning with Eliquis which enjoys an important and strong leadership position that is really in the middle of a journey of growth with significant further opportunity to grow, the strength of our existing Opdivo franchise and the existence of multiple $1 billion opportunities with Opdivo driven by data readouts that will happen in the next 12 to 24 months",pos,train
"So our focus on leveraging our strength, capabilities and what we call the best of pharma has been instrumental in our ability to build for leading franchises from an R&D perspective but at the same time our medium size and our ability to move fast with speed and agility what we call the best of biotech is serving us really well at a time of heavy successful execution in the company",pos,train
Our innovative and differentiated pipeline in I-O and outside of I-O provides a number of catalysts that represent opportunities for sustainable long-term growth,pos,train
"And finally we maintain the financial flexibility to continue to execute our strategy from a business development perspective and at the same time as the transformation of the company continues to advance, I do expect that our growth can result in considerable expansion of our margins",pos,train
"I’m confident - that I’m confident, that’s what our strategy to continue to grow the company sustainably for the long term and diversify the sort of opportunities we have",pos,train
"And I’m quite proud that what I hear from many of our discussions is that because of our priority in business development, because of the strength of our science and the focus of our team increasingly we are becoming a partner of choice to so many companies that have interesting technologies where we have an opportunity to work together",pos,test
We’ve been able to successfully do that within applied and it allows our forward facing teams to have more customer facing and customer focused activities,pos,train
And some of that will be the degree of service because both businesses do assembly of products to provide a solution,pos,train
"So really the opportunity to move and be the clear leader in engineered fluid power and flow control, it's just such a natural adjacency and we talked a little bit earlier",pos,train
"So it's a very nice adjacency on that side, I think there is common customers that we may be entering through different avenues to reach so there'll be some common customer opportunity but also new customer opportunity where one side of the business or the other has a very good position and relationship",pos,test
Now the exciting part begins as we look forward to completing the acquisitions and working with the FCX team to realize the excellent growth potential from our combined organizations,pos,train
"While continuous improvement is a never-ending goal, teamwork makes the meaningful progress possible, further strengthening our foundation and generating benefits for all Applied stakeholders in the years ahead",pos,train
We’re just going to be able to accelerate that with even more opportunities,pos,test
"I think we'll get back to you about that as we continue to work through the guidance, the updated guidance as we move forward here with the combination of businesses",pos,train
Any more specifics on what the combined team will be doing differently going forward to drive that,pos,train
So that would be the same here but the technical expertise awareness competency across flow control and fluid power is very high,pos,train
"Mark, with regard to the cigarette filter tow market, can you elaborate on your expectations for 2018 and perhaps touch upon things like inventory levels, input cost expectations and selling price trajectory for that business?",neg,train
When do you expect the Blackstone transaction to close? Or are the probabilities too uncertain to really forecast the date?,neg,train
"I guess, just to clarify my question, you don't think some of your competitors are down because [indiscernible] methanol because of the seasonal shutdowns",neg,train
"Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures",neg,train
Explanations of these measures and the reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information,neg,test
The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on the Form 8-K,neg,train
The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a separate Form 8-K,neg,train
"This morning, we'll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then open up for your questions",neg,train
"And long term, you discussed maybe doing a JV with this business or, I guess, a tow-like transaction to take out some capital",neg,train
Is that still an option or a possibility in the near to medium term?,neg,train
So they can't really export with the kind of fever that you like,neg,train
"So I think the days of that for everybody, not just for Celanese, this year would kind of go on, and you're going to see what investments you see would be very responsible and very needed to fit local demand and/or unique chemistry that maybe can be exported",neg,train
"But I wouldn't think so, not in our Chain business",neg,train
"I mean, I would just add, the impact on us with all these MTO dynamics, it really does interject a lot of volatility into the world and into our model",neg,train
You’ll see methanol price move up and down because of that,neg,train
It’s unlikely to get stuck like it got stuck in 2016 at a very low point,neg,train
Can you talk about the pension injection of $316 million? Was that done for tax reasons or reasons of strategic flexibility?,neg,train
"And our last question will come from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt",neg,train
You mentioned the new plant coming up in the U,neg,train
What’s your view of the uranium plants that are due to come online this year? Chance? No chance? How would you kind of plug those into a supply-demand model?,neg,train

"I think you see a lot of the growth we've had, has been foreign growth",neg,train
You've seen changes in tax rates across the globe now in nearing what you see in the U,neg,train
"So I think that has been a trend that with the profile of the growth of our business and where that’s happened, that’s been favorable to us",neg,train
", you saw a nice reduction in rate, 14% reduction in rate",neg,train
"as kind of a giveback, but it did have a nice net 2% benefit moving to 2018",neg,train
"And as follow up for AEM, I mean, volume growth has been really on a roll",neg,train
"Yes, you outlined nicely Phase 2 there, and we'll see what happens there",neg,train
20 upside relative to The Street in just Q4 alone,neg,test
"Could that be the area where if there – where – I don't want to use the term sandbagging or something like – that you might feel little bit better about being able to outperform in 2018 given where trends are and you guys are, et cetera?",neg,train
"You mentioned in your prepared remarks that post Omni, nylon is roughly 15% of the AEM segment",neg,train
"Of the incremental project growth that you're seeing in AEM, can you just give us a sense as to how fast nylon has grown versus your other molecular platforms?",neg,test
"And so when you look at that equation, that also means we can make decisions every day about buying and selling",neg,train
"And we can buy – where we might go up in volume, we can actually lower our own production rate and have something to fill it",neg,train
So we participate in the market as a full player,neg,train
"So I think that – I mean, there’s no more risk in that than the ongoing risk every day we have moving, producing and selling the millions of tons that we do",neg,train
Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global,neg,train
What was your volume growth in Advanced Engineered Materials exclusive of acquisition activity?,neg,train
Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet,neg,train
And so we are entertaining all options relative to doing that,neg,train
"So our belief system, though, is that the way to do that is to create stronger and stronger value equations",neg,train
"And if you've done that, then I think you can maybe do something separate with the business",neg,train
"Good morning, and welcome to the Celanese Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions",neg,test
"Question with the new plant and the changes at Ibn Sina, of the growth this year kind of in your guidance, what percent is that?",neg,train
"Great, thanks, Surabhi, and welcome to everyone listening in today",neg,train
"Our prepared comments were shared with earnings yesterday, so I will kick off with a few comments and then take your questions",neg,train
Let me first highlight our recent agreement to acquire Omni Plastics,neg,train
Omni specializes in custom compounding of nylon and combining Omni with our Nilit and SO,neg,train
TER acquisitions creates a global nylon franchise and increases nylon to 50% of AEM’s net sales,neg,train
We expect the acquisition to be EPS neutral for 2018 and contribute about $0,neg,train
"And then – sorry? And then with your M&A, obviously, the focus is on AEM",neg,train
"But I was wondering if there are opportunities in other segments at all for – I don't know, potential bolt-ons or larger acquisitions",neg,train
"I mean, we did source quite a lot, but there’s really a number of reasons that, that goes on",neg,train
"One, of course, we had a large turnaround earlier in the year; two, Hurricane Harvey impacted us in the Gulf Coast; but three, and the largest reason is that trading is part of our daily model",neg,train
"So we traded a couple hundred thousand tons last year, and we traded with more than 20 partners",neg,train
"It’s not near as big as our self-production, but it is part of the model",neg,train
"So yes, we’re off to a good start for the year",neg,train
We should have a pretty okay first quarter in that process,neg,test
We think the first half will be stronger than the second half for these reasons – these structural reasons that I mentioned,neg,train
"And for my follow-up, in Acetyl Intermediates, your EBITDA went up about $30 million sequentially",neg,train
"Is that mostly from China, in Europe? Or if you had to divide it across your geographies, where were the larger sequential EBITDA benefits? Where were the smaller ones?",neg,train
"Well, we said last year when we visited in June or whenever that was, we expected it midyear, and I think that's still kind of the view that we have",neg,test
"That can move around a little bit, depending on the heat of the day",neg,train
"But that seems to be when we look at the timeline and the pace of things, we think that's what we'll see",neg,train
"I mean, look, I would say every market that we operate in, in AEM, we're able to grow volume",neg,train
"I mean, we even grew volume in auto very nicely in the fourth quarter of 2017 because it is all about that model",neg,train
"So I mean, we're predicting that we'll be able to close 3,000 projects when you think about project-by-project growth, but we also still have a nice M&A pipeline that's at work for bolt-ons",neg,test
The recent Tax Cut and Jobs Act will have a positive impact on our adjusted tax rate in 2018 lowering it by approximately 2% to 14%,neg,train
"The tax benefit should offset investments and resources required to support our accelerated growth, which we estimated roughly $0",neg,train
All-in we are increasing earnings guidance per share in 2018 to 10% to 14% with the first half roughly 25% to 35% higher than the second and most of that difference occurring in the first quarter,neg,train
"Thanks, I think you guys have some pretty interesting windows into what's going on in China given your presence there",neg,train
"I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about the likely sustainability of some of these environmental efforts",neg,train
"I guess, I'm curious on a couple of points there",neg,train
"One, have you suffered at all from any of your downstream customers that have maybe been subject to some of these curtailments? And then secondly, can you give us any window on the volatility you might expect going forward from the MTO market and what influence that would have on your operations or profitability?",neg,train
"My follow-up, we've seen some reports of unplanned issues, mostly regarding problems affecting Nanjing, Jurong and then your Clear Lake methanol facility",neg,train
Can you just provide any color here? What kind of financial impacts might this have? And how long do you expect these feedstock limitations to persist?,neg,test
Celanese Corporation's fourth quarter 2017 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close,neg,train
Slides and prepared remarks for the quarter were also posted on our website at www,neg,train
"As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentation may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, our future objectives and plans",neg,train
Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides,neg,train
Thank you for all your questions and for listening in this morning,neg,train
We’re available after the call to address any further questions you may have,neg,train
Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners,neg,train
"No, I would echo exactly the same thing, look, demand continues to fall somewhat",neg,train
But we offset that with productivity around taking out costs,neg,train
"And you’ll see us do that in 2018, and 2018 will be pretty similar to 2017 in terms of earnings",neg,train
It’s – and Kevin may want to give more color on this,neg,train
"But as you look at the tax laws that are – the clarifications being read out, we expect this to be a little bit lumpy in – over the next several years as we settle in exactly what those rates are",neg,train
"So, what’s interesting in China today Bob is, none of these policies or practices are new",neg,train
"The government has been promoting for a period of time, but there is now a connectivity between the municipalities and provinces to really these things happen",neg,train
So it's reached a level of maturity in principle to drive real change,neg,train
So that's the sort of the fundamental shift that we're now seeing in the region,neg,train
"Turning to 2017 fully consolidated results, I am pleased to report GAAP earnings of $6",neg,train
"The Acetyl Chain core income was $575 million, a 27% improvement over 2016",neg,train
1% exceeded a previous high in 2016 by 260 basis points,neg,train
Our asset base that spans the globe combined with a unique commercial flexibility enabled us to respond swiftly to industry and market dynamics throughout the year,neg,train
"Well, I make a few comments and then Scott is going to comment",neg,train
"That business, we’ve said that we anticipate keeping the earnings relatively flat, and we do, and we’re doing that through productivity, though",neg,test
"So we don’t – compared to input prices of those things, that really doesn’t – none of those things matter as much as the hard reality that the market continues to collapse",neg,train
And we’re just managing that process in a pretty effective way through productivity,neg,test

"With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Oliver, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"I mean, you certainly have the winter season and the winter heating season, which means that nat gas comes out of the market and goes in all of those applications, and there is some nat gas derivative there",neg,train
"So the way we look at it – the way I look at it – Scott may do it differently, is it's almost like Chinese New Year",neg,train
So you have before Chinese New Year kind of conduct and you have post conduct,neg,train
"So I think you'll see that seasonality like we have seen it, but it – again, at this new stepped up rate, it has less of an impact than it used to have before",neg,train
"In fact, there's just as many turnarounds on the calendar going forward as there's been over the last 12 months as well",neg,train
"I mean, it was a – we had been – you kind of know this",neg,train
"We had – a few years ago, we had a pretty sizable pension liability, and we've systematically worked it down",neg,train
"We think at the highest level principally, that's the right thing to do",neg,train
"We have something like 25,000 retirees – legacy retirees at Celanese, and it means a lot to us to make sure those men and women were all taken care of forever",neg,train
We were advantaged to do it in the fourth quarter given the interest rates and given the change in the tax law,neg,train
"Mark, it's a two-part question on, obviously, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the sort of China pollution curb side of things",neg,train
"So within acetic, how much of a bump-up should we expect to see, let's say, in terms of global utilization rates from some of these curbs that have been talked about pollution-related in China? So that's one side of it",neg,train
"So obviously methanol, a large part of, obviously, the methanol growth story is predicated on MTO",neg,train
"So should we expect to see any curbs on the sort of influx of new methanol capacity via the sort of coal to methanol side of things and, thereafter, MTO side of things as a result of this as well?",neg,train
I would like to turn the conference back over to Surabhi Varshney for any closing remarks,neg,train
"No, I mean, all of it grew in terms of absolute margin expansion",neg,train
"Given the recent strength, is it fair to assume a decent amount of input cost pressure could be coming in Q1 with the raws moving up? And then what kind of offsets here as the guidance you guys gave implies Q1 could be one of the stronger quarters this year?",neg,train
"No, we’re going through a process of working with the objections in there, and we’re not opposed to a remedy if it will be needed",neg,train
"I felt it was needed by the commission, but we haven’t got to that point in the process",neg,train
"We think that stands on its own, and we’re arguing that with the commission",neg,train
I have no doubt they can run anything they build,neg,train
"I think the more you invest in these businesses, though, the more technically complex they occur",neg,train
And it’s not for the faint of heart to get into that when you get in the C2 chemistry,neg,train
"And I think if they run it, they’re going to consume more methanol",neg,train
"Yes, I would just add that Mike even in the fourth quarter as well, we've done a lot of work in this business to dampen seasonality as well",neg,train
"Part of that dampening comes through selling more in Asia, so you see that impact also",neg,train
"I mean, the best performance improvement came in Asia, particularly China",neg,train
"However, that has repercussions on the rest of the globe as well",neg,train
Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W,neg,train
"Consumer Specialties segment income was $333 million and declined year-over-year due to lower tow price and volume in 2017, which reflected lower demand and depressed utilization rates across the tow industry",neg,train
"In AEM, growth in both new and legacy polymers, along with increasing success in China partially offset by planned turnarounds puts adjusted earnings per share growth for AEM at about $0",neg,train
Consumer Specialties should be relatively flat versus 2017 and the tow JV should be neutral to earnings upon close,neg,train
"We are getting 1% step-up in Ibn Sina, which is in itself pretty handsome",neg,train
"If I just draw a circle around Ibn Sina, they have a couple of big site outages there that they’re doing this year, which is a pretty negative impact",neg,train
"And so there’s going to be a modest step-up there, I think, we tagged at another $10 million, which is less than half of the total step-up",neg,train
"You’ll see it, but you won’t see quite as much stuff as the math would tell you would see",neg,train
"In acetyls, you mentioned that you sourced the equivalent of a full plant for early in the year",neg,train
Is that basically the market was a little loose early in the year and you took that volume – excess volume off the market to help tighten things and then just resold it at a profit later in the year?,neg,train
"Your prepared remarks mentioned they have some type of IP around working with recycled content, which is becoming a bigger issue, particularly in the EU",neg,train
"How do you look at seasonality in China? To what degree the tightness that we see right now is due to the seasonal shutdowns, either on the coal side or maybe downstream in acetyls or in methanol? So do you think just that seasonal impact will be there going forward? Or it's not really about that?",neg,train
I don't think we will see that changing or feel like that's going to change,neg,train
"So whether that's 10 basis points or 12 basis points or something like that, but – so we're up in the 80s now, probably on the instantaneous today kind of rate",neg,test
We’re not anticipating a bunch of new plants to be built for the reasons I mentioned earlier nor we think it will go back to some lower level in the future,neg,train
"Yes, there has been a margin squeeze, as we talked about",neg,train
"Every business that we're buying is materially lower margin, and we've been pretty clear about the need to increase that",neg,test
We had a number of unit operation issues throughout the quarter,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets,neg,train
And really quickly if I could sort of a follow-up on the methanol side of things,neg,train
"I mean, you talked about certain people sort of talked to you guys about the influx of new capacity in Iran",neg,train
How are you guys thinking about the Iranian sort of MTO conversion side of things?,neg,train
"No I don’t think, I think – I think it’s – no, the way we do deals is we go out and knock on doors, and so you just get rejected a lot in that process",neg,train
"So no, it's not really been a question of fit and willingness on the part of the person that you're asking to sell the properly",neg,train
"But also, that model has the opportunity to flex up and down a little bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on what kind of dynamics are out there",neg,train
And there can be some cracks in those dynamics later in the year,neg,train
"As a result, you get some of that quarter-to-quarter fluctuation",neg,test
"But every single year, that business will be growing profitably",neg,train
"I mean, Omni just has a nice part of their business whereby they start with, call it, post-consumer resin, and particularly nylon and polypropylene",neg,train
And that’s a part of the business that Celanese hasn’t participated in historically in a very big way,neg,train
"And then, take another step and do something with it like the tow JV",neg,test
I think I was probably a bit too – I probably pushed out a bit further my comments than I really wanted to,neg,train
But we do expect more pressure in the back half of the year as these new volumes come on,neg,train
So my kind of gut is that you’re going to see some reduction in that methanol value as you get on through the year,neg,train
"And for that reason, around your first comment, we expect the first half of the year to be stronger than the second half numbers that [indiscernible] but you could see quarter-to-quarter volatility that could even be inconsistent with that, if I can say that",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
Materials Solutions generated core income of $900 million in 2017 and net sales of $2,neg,test
"Advanced Engineered Materials set new highs with segment income of $567 million, an expansion of $88 million over 2016 from growth in base business, new acquisitions, and higher affiliate earnings",neg,train
"1%, 610 basis points lower than the prior year mainly from margin dilutive acquisitions",neg,train
"Volume increased 46% in 2017 year-over-year, from growth in organic polymers and acquisitions",neg,train
"If you put a straight edge on the trend line, you've end up with a higher number",neg,train
"And all we're saying, though, is that there's been such a monumental change in China",neg,train
You've got – and you've got a lot of good things going your way,neg,train
"You've got a lot of methanol out of the market, about six million annual tons out in the last quarter",neg,test
"That comes back on as we get into the end of the first quarter, start of the second",neg,train
There's a new plant starting up here in the U,neg,train
And we're not sure exactly what ethanol play is going to be in China now,neg,train
"We did have one company I'm thinking about in particular that did some work for us in the polymer business, was under shutdown orders, and we managed to work with them a bit and keep it operational until we could get our technology in place and our capability in place to replicate what they were doing",neg,train
So I think there is some element of working with as the effectivity is occurring,neg,train
And just my second question is on the tax rate and the 14% for 2018,neg,train
Is that the right steady-state tax rate to think about for the company post the tax reform? Or is anything discrete to the year that may not repeat going forward? Thanks so much,neg,train
"Now to tow JV, we have received regulatory approval in four of the six jurisdictions",neg,train
We strongly believe in the value created by the JV and then preparation have completed the creation of a new legal entity and operating structure for the cellulose derivative business,neg,train
"Mark, in terms of AEM margins were squeezed a little bit",neg,train
How do you think pricing is coming along to recoup some of that as you head into 2018?,neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney, Vice President-Investor Relations",neg,train
But we kind of think the methanol is not going to stay in the low 200s like it had been,neg,train
"We think it’s shifted up and it’ll be in the 300s, in the mid-300s, and that’s a good place for us from an acetic acid point of view and that chain point of view",neg,train
"Really, practically speaking, China is not very desirous of overinvesting in big chemistry these days, so you're not seeing a lot of that",neg,train
"I mean, you're seeing some technical investments, which what I'd call MTO, to bring on olefins capacity, blended olefins capacity",neg,train
But to build more of these plants means you're building more coal gasification,neg,train
"It means you're adding cost in a system that, to be honest, is not global low cost",neg,train
The whole product solution platform is growing fast across all of AEM-wide,neg,train
"Of course, our nylon business is growing just because of the acquisitions we've done, marrying up to some of the organic business that we had",neg,train
"In the Acetyl Chain, are expectations in M&A too high or too – I mean, are people expecting too much in terms of price?",neg,train
Kevin Oliver – Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
", to a European structure, we were, in many ways, a little bit ahead of this, I would say",neg,train
"And so the rate you saw, it sort of like has been now continued with the lowering of the rate in the U",neg,train
So you’re moving more towards a European system than a historical U,neg,train
"First, a follow-up on the AI, sort of the trading component of it",neg,train
Can you just help us understand what type of risk is involved in that type of activity? Are you able to hedge? Or are you just only taking on this sort of third-party volume when you – it’s sort of more of an agency model or you already now serve the other end of the side of the trade?,neg,test
Our next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs,neg,train
"And like we saw there early last year, when we had a major unit get operational difficulties, they ended up swinging 250,000 tons if I recall,-ish, 200,000 tons of methanol in and out of the market",neg,train
You’re going to have nonetheless more volatility because of that C1 to C2 connection going through these assets,neg,train
"At Celanese, we like high pricing and we like volatility, so it’s good for us",neg,train
"So assets are being shut down and are, if they're continuing to operate at reinvestments, they have to then justify a stronger economic – a strong economic case for that",neg,train
"So if we look at the new project growth rate of the last few years, it's been pretty high",neg,train
"I was just wondering if we're getting to a point now where it has to naturally just kind of cool off a bit as we head into 2018, 2019?",neg,train
"I mean, the end markets, first of all, there's a few complementary markets to where we're already in",neg,train
"But interestingly enough, it also provides us access to some markets that we don't participate in a big way today",neg,test
"As far as it being accretive or not, I mean, there is a step-up in some first-year costs that we have that basically make it a zero from an EPS standpoint",neg,train
"And then I think you had a third one, too, but can you repeat that, Matthew?",neg,train
We just haven't been able to quite pull them off yet,neg,test
"I mean, exclusive of acquisitions for the full year, we grew volume about 13% for the fourth quarter",neg,train
And if you believe that nat gas stays low in the U,neg,train
"So methanol to MTO to ethylene, you should have a good window of arbitrage there available to those builders",neg,train
So we think MTO is going to stay strong in China and may even have more capacity added,neg,train
"Let me close by reminding you that our Investor Day is scheduled for May 1st of this year in New York, where we will outline our Strategy 3",neg,train
0 and highlight growth plans and structural opportunities before us through 2020,neg,train
"With that, I will turn it over to Surabhi for your questions",neg,train
"What kind of end markets are you most excited about here? And then also on the financial side, any more color on why this deal is EPS-neutral this year given that it would boost revenue by 2%",neg,train
And I thought it offered EBIT margins around where like SO,neg,test
And that comes through as a benefit to us from a cash flow point of view this year,neg,train
"Now we're able to balance it pretty well, and we think that we have completely divorced ourselves from worrying about pensions",neg,train
"Look, I mean, fundamental dynamics, fundamental conditions in China are much better",neg,train
"Mark, as that continued to grow, there hasn't been a lot of acetyl capacity addition on top of that",neg,train
The competitors that are there are having to run in more of a structured format in terms of environmental and economics as well,neg,train
All those things come together and all that old discussion around nameplate capacity and utilization doesn't apply anymore,neg,test
"I mean, this industry is operated at a much better utilization rate now",neg,test
And that's likely to be the case for many – a number of years going forward,neg,test
What I said is that we’re really enthusiastic about C1 chemistry chain,neg,train
And we look at that methanol opportunity as an opportunity for C1 chemistry and especially in terms of how we think about working with other people to expand the molecules in our portfolio,neg,train
So I wouldn’t go quite so far as to say that I’m announcing the construction of a methanol plant today,neg,train
"But it is certainly on the table for us, and it has been on the table and it's certainly on the table today for us and especially on the table as we talk to others about the things we can do together relative to growing our business, the C1 chemistry business",neg,train
"And it's not so much our indicator, but it does move that market up and down a bit",neg,train
"I think our feeling is that there's opportunity there, and we'll be able to communicate more about that after we get through the first quarter",neg,train
Our next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
"I mean, I think Eastman contributed a little bit to the momentum",neg,train
"But clearly, if you go back a bit, David, we actually, at the first year, we expected the market to tighten, especially in Asia, and we expected that shift to occur in methanol",neg,train
And then it actually started before any of these outages you talked about,neg,train
"Actually, it started at the end of the third quarter there",neg,train
So not – it was part of it but not a huge part,neg,train
And really the focus is with the European Commission and going through that process,neg,train
"Well, I mean, there’s always raw material volatility in that Chain business, but I don’t think – I’m looking at Scott",neg,train
I don’t think we see that being particularly onerous in the first quarter more than in any other quarter that’s out there,neg,test
I think we feel pretty good about the first quarter,neg,train
"The question really is, will that floor stay quite as high as it pull back a little bit as we get later in the year for those reasons I mentioned earlier?",neg,train
And then back to the question on the antitrust review on cig tow,neg,train
"In Europe, are there any remedies in discussion yet? Or you’re still expecting that you’ll get approval in Europe without any remedies?",neg,train
Our next question is from Dan DiCicco with RBC Capital Markets,neg,test
"Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
"We do think that rate is sustainable, but at the same time, yes, this is a significant change in tax law",neg,train
"So there could be some minor changes here or there, but we're not expecting a material impact",neg,train
"You guys are still expecting methanol prices to stay above 400 this year, or at least average 400",neg,train
Is it fair to say that you guys have factored in that new capacity from Iran? And then have you thought about potential ethylene price erosion? And what that does to MTO for some of the new U,neg,test
Any inspiration to build that second methanol plant given where margins are?,neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] Auston, please open the lines for Q&A now",neg,train
"Mark, you just mentioned that you’re very excited about the potential to build a methanol plant in the U",neg,train
How do you think about the sizing of this plant and the timing? Is the idea here to just fully integrate or maybe go a little methanol to some degree?,neg,train
"One of the things we've seen, of course, the big MTO units are now up and running",neg,train
"And we're definitely at – I'm not sure what today's price is – at $1,400 a ton",neg,train
There is margin even at $400 a ton methanol for these guys to do well,neg,train
"I do believe, though, this industry is one of – it's built in a way that can be turned on or off to match the – to deal with that arbitrage that exists between C1 and C2 chemistry",neg,train
"So we expect some volatility in the second half for this year, but it won't be sustained",neg,train
That's one of the reasons we've been a little bit cautious about forecasting continued – driving growth fully completely through the year on that chain,neg,test
We'll know more as we get up and as we end the first quarter and get to the second,neg,train
"But I do expect volatility, but I think fundamentally, that's changed, Bob, so it's not going to go back like it did",neg,train
"Well, definitely in China, there's been some, right? There's been some restriction on gas even transfer of where the coal origination is used as well",neg,train
So then you don't expect a whole lot of new acetyls capacity? Is that fair?,neg,train
"Just a clarification on your – the tow approvals from China, Russia, Turkey and Mexico",neg,train
"Just to be clear, there is no remedies or contingencies that are part of those approvals, are there?",neg,train
Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"And just quickly, my second question on your tax rate",neg,train
"And now with the new tax law, it goes down to 14%",neg,train
Can you talk about the progression of your tax rate since 2014 and sort of what factors drove that? Thank you,neg,train
"Well – and have Scott hop in, in a little bit",neg,train
"We use the term now that's really instantaneous capacity, which is a view of kind of the operating environment of the day",neg,train
"And in that instantaneous capacity, it's quite often different than shell capacity that's out there",neg,train
"And we have seen, as we went through the last year or so, we have seen instantaneous capacity rates continue to rise within China",neg,train
I don’t we would talk about first quarter things that are going on,neg,train
"We have these impacts in the third quarter and, in particular, some in the fourth",neg,train
They're not going to be gigantic but there is some small impacts,neg,train
"Last month, we reported the topline results from the fourth and final Phase III study in the pivotal program evaluating risankizumab in psoriasis",neg,train
"In this study, the enhanced trial 73% of risankizumab patients achieved PASI 90 and nearly half achieved PASI 100 compared to just 2% and 1% of patients on placebo at the PASI 90 and PASI 100 levels respectively",neg,train
"And consistent with the previous Phase III results, we saw very durable rates of skin clearance",neg,train
"Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"Moving on to R&D, where we have built a compelling pipeline of innovative late-stage products with differentiated clinical profiles into sustained and compelling patient benefits",neg,train
"In 2017, we saw a significant evolution of our pipeline with a number of important clinical development and regulatory milestones, which I'll briefly highlight",neg,train
We anticipate first quarter operational revenue growth approaching the mid-teens,neg,train
"Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have a favorable impact on reported sales growth of 3% in the first quarter",neg,train
"Overall across the program, we continue to feel good about the safety profile we've observed",neg,train
"We see a profile that's very consistent with our expectations both for this molecule and for a molecule that we treat, the sorts of diseases where upadacitinib is being developed",neg,test
"Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $708 million in the quarter, up 39% compared with the same period a year ago",neg,train
"6 billion, driven by continued uptake in the front-line CLL market and steady gains across other indications",neg,train
I would say those are the areas that we have focused a tremendous amount of attention on,neg,train
"Based on our current managed care contracting status, we have parity access across 65% of the covered lives in the U",neg,train
", with much of that access coming in the last 60 days",neg,train
So as those patients were to fail or progress then they would be given other treatment options and we would expect based on the data that VENCLEXTA will get a significant piece of that business and of that patient population,neg,train
So by definition it means that it will be a bit more gradual as it grows because there'll be this trade-off between IMBRUVICA's current position,neg,train
We have seen very strong uptake from MAVYRET both in the U,neg,train
"and internationally, and continued robust underlying performance from other products and our portfolio, driving our expectations for 2018 higher than we previously projected",neg,train
"And then the final thing is when you look at volume, what's happening with our volume? And in every single category, derm, rheum and GI, we're growing our volume significantly",neg,train
And so I look at the health of HUMIRA and the health of the U,neg,train
"business, and I can just have a tremendous amount of confidence in where we're going",neg,train
"On OUS, we have said all along that we expect the brand to peak this year and then start to gradually decline over time",neg,train
"We are also planning a one-time shareable contribution of approximately $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations, supporting initiatives such as the Puerto Rico rebuilding efforts, children's healthcare access programs, and charities that support our local communities needs",neg,train
Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America,neg,train
So the purpose of giving some long range guidance on that tax rate,neg,test
"Look, I think it was important for us to put out the right rate for you guys to model from a non-GAAP perspective on tax",neg,test
That for 2018 is that approximately the 9% number we gave,neg,train
"That said, our business mix will change over the coming years most notably with products driving increased U",neg,test
"I think you should look at products like IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA et cetera",neg,train
And that will have the impact of taking the rate up,neg,test
"And that's why I say gradually as those businesses grow, it will have an impact of lifting the tax rate?",neg,train
"In addition to the previously mentioned one-time tax on historical unrepatriated earnings, the legislation will allow for a more efficient future repatriation of foreign earnings and as a result a lower adjusted tax rate",neg,train
Regarding the question with respect to VENCLEXTA and past to front-line,neg,train
So we have actually two studies already underway in the front-line setting,neg,train
"One in the younger, more fit patient population, one in an older patient population with more comorbid illnesses on average",neg,train
"Those studies all look at combinations, combinations with CD20s like GAZYVA or RITUXAN",neg,train
We think we have adequate capacity to pursue any M&A of the magnitude that we'd be looking at in the near-term,neg,train
"The point I made in my comments, I mean we are on the front end of what would be tremendous growth for AbbVie",neg,test
Our final question today is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"At the recent ASH Meeting, we reported new three-year follow-up from the RESONATE-2 study demonstrating that in treatment-naïve CLL patients, long-term treatment with IMBRUVICA is leading to sustained improvements in patient reported outcomes and quality of life, as well as significant decreases in disease related symptoms",neg,train
"As you know, on our third quarter call, we provided 2018 EPS guidance reflecting 17% growth at the midpoint",neg,train
There are been several positive developments since we outlined our initial outlook,neg,train
"Now turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin was 79% of sales, down versus the prior year primarily due to the dilutive impacts of partnership accounting and exchange on hedged currencies",neg,train
"And just first recounting it, while congratulations as well deserved and really nice move on the [indiscernible], particularly into Puerto Rico",neg,train
"First question for you, on 2018 outlook, I mean obviously this does not as I understand include any impact from share repurchases, you got tremendous momentum on your earnings I think that needs to be pushed through here",neg,train
"This is something more of a progressive program, I wonder if you can comment around that because it would just seem that timing would be in your favor to do something on accelerated basis?",neg,test
"Starting with Rova-T, our registrational trial in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, the TRINITY study continues to progress and we expect data in the second quarter with our regulatory submission following soon thereafter",neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
We continued to see strong momentum with HUMIRA in the fourth quarter,neg,train
IMBRUVICA also delivered strong momentum and growth with full-year 2017 sales approaching $2,neg,test
"6 billion, an increase of 41% over the prior year",neg,test
"In the quarter, IMBRUVICA delivered strong growth of approximately 39% versus the prior year",neg,train
"1% of sales, reflecting our ongoing support of pipeline programs",neg,train
2% of sales lower than the prior year as a result of sales leverage and our continuing focus on operational efficiencies,neg,train
Adjusted net interest expense was $252 million and the adjusted tax rate was 18,neg,train
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items were $1,neg,train
"And with respect to 414, that's our antibody drug conjugate in glioblastoma multiforme, so primary brain cancer",neg,train
"So we would be sufficient to support approval, obviously based on the results",neg,train
"So we can't predict the exact time when that would read out, but we'd expect to have more information from that front-line study sometime next year",neg,train
"So it's a leading indicator of where your share will go in the future for patients that are well maintained, they stay on the brand",neg,train
"For patients that aren’t well maintained, whatever that brand is they move to an alternative",neg,train
"So if you look at RA, our first-line share is 40%",neg,train
"Today, I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate for the year ahead",neg,train
"2017 was a very productive year with a dozen pivotal trial readouts, several regulatory submissions and approvals, and several important phase transitions across our key programs",neg,train
And we expect 2018 to be another catalyst rich year,neg,train
William Chase - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call,neg,train
All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call,neg,train
"We also have clinical programs recently initiated or expected to begin very soon for other key early-stage assets, including our RORgamma t inverse agonist, and our anti-TNF steroid ADC",neg,train
"That's the commitment that we’ve made to investors, the commitment that we've made to the organization",neg,test
"We also had several studies ongoing to evaluate IMBRUVICA alone or in combination in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population",neg,train
"These studies will add to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of the compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting",neg,train
We expect to begin seeing data from these Phase III trials towards the end of 2019,neg,train
"And then lastly, Bill if you just talk a little bit about leverage and that’s naturally de-levering the company, and of course, you’ve got all of this cash flow",neg,train
So how are you thinking about how you might alter the leverage of the company in the future and does that affect your appetite for M&A? Thanks,neg,train
And this has been something that has moved around a little bit over time,neg,train
I would agree that it is our expectation that the volume should stabilize going forward,neg,train
"But I'd also say that there could be some single-digit kind of pressure, downward pressure",neg,train
We obviously priced the product where we described it in the public channel market at the level that the current pricing was and we have maintained that pricing going forward,neg,train
We have been seeking parity contracts – non-exclusive contracts with the payers,neg,train
"And therefore, pricing has not been a big issue for us",neg,train
"And I would say, we're not at a point right now were we will make a decision as to whether or not it would be an accelerated kind of an approach or would be more typical of how we buyback shares on more of a ratable consistent basis",neg,train
77 per share in specified items related to the 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,neg,train
"5 billion tax payable, related to previously unrepatriated earnings partially offset by related valuation adjustments to tax related balance sheet items",neg,train
This one-time net charge has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results,neg,train
"For VENCLEXTA, we expect sales above $300 million in 2018",neg,test
"As Mike mentioned, based on the MURANO data, we recently submitted our regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA plus RITUXAN in relapsed/refractory CLL and we look forward to expanding VENCLEXTA into this broader setting in the second half of the year",neg,train
"For Creon, we expect sales growth of 10% in 2018",neg,test
"So if you look at the overall market growth rate, you should be thinking of it as high single-digits to low double-digits just in the United States",neg,train
"Derm, growing about 15%, so the big market growing rapidly",neg,train
"GI growing about 16% overall, so again a big market growing very rapidly",neg,train
"That's primarily in Southern Europe, so places like Spain, Italy, Portugal",neg,train
"Global fourth quarter sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease increased 20",neg,train
"Finally, we saw strong sales growth in the quarter on an operational basis for Creon, up almost 11%, and Synagis, up more that 4%",neg,train
83 of contribution from tax rate reductions as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,neg,train
"Relative to our prior guidance for 2018, stronger operating performance accounted for an increase of $0",neg,train
Michael Severino - Executive Vice President-Research and Chief Scientific Officer,neg,train
"Going back it seems that your current dividend payout is about 42% has come down as your earnings has grown, it has been as high as 50%",neg,train
"If you look at AS, it’s 62%, if you look at psoriasis, if you include Otezla, it's 40%",neg,train
"If you exclude Otezla because Otezla really competes in a slightly different segment, it's 54%",neg,train
So we have very strong positions as the first-line agent across every single category,neg,train
"For cash flow though, if we look at our cash generation across the next 10 years, this is a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash",neg,train
"And now with tax reform, we have access to that cash in a much more efficient way than we did previously",neg,train
We expect SG&A to be just over 20% of sales,neg,train
"This includes incremental spend related to the launch activities for elagolix and endometriosis, and VENCLEXTA in the broader relapsed/refractory CLL market as well as AML",neg,test
"Despite these investments, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline due to our rapidly growing topline",neg,train
"So now with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick",neg,train
The productivity of our pipeline is becoming increasingly evident and we have a significant number of upcoming product launches that are poised to drive significant growth,neg,train
"In 2017, we launched MAVYRET, which has become a major growth driver for us",neg,train
"This year, we will launch a major label expansion for VENCLEXTA in relapsed/refractory CLL as well as elagolix in endometriosis",neg,test
"Secondly on VENCLEXTA, could you give us any indication of what the path might be to first-line, is obviously is very encouraging data for VENCLEXTA in combination with IMBRUVICA in CLL and wondering if it's feasible that you might do a first-line study",neg,train
"I think I'll answer the HUMIRA question maybe a bit more broadly because I think every single quarter, as some competitor has a hiccup or claims some level of victory, we have nervousness investors as it relates to HUMIRA",neg,train
And look I can understand why it's obviously a flagship product of our Company,neg,train
"With respect to upadacitinib and atopic dermatitis, we feel very good about those data",neg,train
And we think that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation reflects clearly the degree of activity that we've shown today and so we are currently actively designing that Phase III program,neg,test
"Just two questions on HUMIRA, maybe the first, a U",neg,train
"specific question, help us understand a little bit of the volume versus price components as we think about your 2018 outlook",neg,train
", I may have missed it, but was there stocking for MAVYRET? And are there any getting factors for getting full reimbursement across Europe and Japan, and then how do you guys think about price U",neg,train
versus OUS? Is it different today versus how you think initially with VIEKIRA?,neg,train
"Moving now to oncology, where we continue to advance our programs for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA",neg,train
"These two therapies alone and in combination with other medicines are demonstrating extremely strong activity in a broad range of cancers such as CLL, AML, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which should enable us to expand our already strong position in hematologic malignancies",neg,train
3 billion in 2017 including global sales of MAVYRET which approached $500 million,neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, total HCV sales grew more than 62% versus the prior year",neg,train
While are still at the early stages of our commercialization,neg,test
We have been very pleased with average strong uptake in both the U,neg,train
Our guidance for the quarter reflects an adjusted effective tax rate approaching 8% lower than our full-year expectation reflecting the fact that the tax benefit on equity compensation is most pronounced in the first quarter of each year,neg,train
"Chris, on price volume, as I said in my comments for the quarter, the 15% growth, I think you just think of 10% volume, the remainder being priced",neg,train
"As you look at 2018, where we got a projection of 13% to 14% growth in the U",neg,test
"year-over-year that we still expect that mid single-digit price range to stick, which would then imply a volume of high single-digits",neg,train
We are forecasting 2018 AndroGel sales of approximately $475 million,neg,train
"For Duodopa, we expect sales in 2018 of approximately [$458 million]",neg,train
We are forecasting ZINBRYTA sales of less than $100 million reflecting recent labeling changes and the introduction of competitive alternatives,neg,train
"Based on this level of projected performance, in the fourth quarter we recorded a non-cash charge of $354 million reflecting an impairment of ZINBRYTA related assets",neg,train
"And for Synagis, Lupron and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year",neg,train
"As far as price OUS, price outside the United States is basically negotiated country-by-country",neg,train
And how you compare against that benchmark and so each country is different,neg,train
"So in summary, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in 2017 and we are certainly proud of the strong foundation that we have built",neg,train
"We have a high level of confidence in the momentum of our business, which is reflected in our 2018 guidance",neg,train
"Given its strong profile, upadacitinib has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy in RA and could offer meaningful advantages of our products on the market today or in development",neg,test
We expect to see data from two additional pivotal trials in the RA program in the first half of this year with our regulatory submission following in the second half of the year,neg,test
"And then for Mike, on upadacitinib and atopic dermatitis, I want to just get a sense from you about the scope of the Phase III",neg,train
I'm curious whether the breakthrough designation really alters at all your thinking in terms of design like for example our shorter duration study things like that? Thanks guys,neg,train
IMBRUVICA has already changed the treatment paradigm in second-line or greater CLL and following the strong RESONATE-2 data is gaining momentum in the front-line setting,neg,train
We are pleased with the strong Phase III results we have reported across all four pivotal trials and we look forward to submitting our regulatory application in the first half of this year,neg,train
"Based on the data we've generated to date, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naive and TNF and adequate responder patients with moderate to severe psoriasis by offering unmatched levels of efficacy and durable effect with the convenience of quarterly dosing",neg,train
"Our ongoing Phase III studies in small-cell lung cancer also continue to advance, with the TAHOE study in the second-line setting and the MERU trial in front-line patients both now well underway",neg,test
We are also evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in mid-stage combination study with potential to start seeing data from this trial later in the year,neg,train
"With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our fourth quarter and full-year performance",neg,train
"So as I look at that position, I feel very confident about where HUMIRA sits in our execution",neg,train
"The adjusted operating margin profile improved by more than 90 basis points compared with the prior year, inclusive of almost 100 basis points of incremental spending related to the risankizumab and Stemcentrx transactions",neg,train
"I think it is very reasonable to assume that those conversations are going to inform, the Phase III program for upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis",neg,train

Certainly there's a huge unmet medical need and the data that we've shown publicly with Rova-T from the early-stage studies show clear activity,neg,test
So our plans remain unchanged for making good progress with the TRINITY study in third-line or greater,neg,train
"Phase III randomized studies in earlier lines of therapy, the I-O combo studies we're doing in partnership with BMS and the BASKET study in particular",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs,neg,train
"As Rick mentioned, we had another year of outstanding performance in 2017, generating top and bottom line growth that ranks AbbVie among the very top of our industry peers",neg,train
"60, up more than 16% compared to 2016 and ahead of our expectations for the year",neg,train
"The Breakthrough Therapy Designation program has in our mind has been very successful and is very helpful because what it gives you is a lot of direct interaction with the FDA, including very senior members of the FDA that you wouldn't typically have access to at the current stage of development program",neg,train
We have also made tremendous progress advancing our pipeline with impressive data from several assets that are poised to fuel our growth in the years to come,neg,train
HUMIRA continues to deliver outstanding performance with global operational growth of more than 14% for the full-year 2017,neg,train
This performance was driven by continued robust market demand despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars,neg,train
"For IMBRUVICA, we expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $3",neg,test
"Based on MAVYRET successful launch, we expect the global HCV sales in 2018 will exceed $2",neg,train
"Global HCV sales for the fourth quarter were $510 million, increasing more than 62% operationally over the prior year",neg,train
"As Rick mentioned, we've been very pleased with the launch of MAVYRET in the U",neg,train
and international markets and I'll outline our expectations for 2018 in just a few moments,neg,train
"And with that, I will turn the call back over to Liz",neg,train
The one large country that we have not gotten reimbursement yet is France,neg,train
But I'd say the bulk of the countries were in the process or either have reimbursement and have launched or in the process of getting reimbursement and we'll launch once we have that reimbursement,neg,train
"The pricing hasn't fundamentally changed for the brand, so there's not any dramatic moves one way or another from that perspective",neg,train
"What Bill had described and you can see 2017, 15% growth, and then what we're describing for 2018",neg,train
"Going forward, we've done some of that when indirect biosimilars entered the marketplace and we were successful in doing that and we have already started that action now in those European markets",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Consistent with the results from the SELECT-NEXT and SELECT-BEYOND Phase III studies, upadacitinib drove very strong levels of response on all clinical end points",neg,train
"And importantly, on the more stringent end points, such as ACR50, ACR70, low disease activity, and DAS remission",neg,train
"Additionally, the safety profile in the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study was consistent with previously reported Phase III SELECT trials and the Phase II studies with no new safety signals detected",neg,train
"Since our inception as a public company five years ago, AbbVie has demonstrated an exceptional track record of consistently delivering top-tier financial performance",neg,train
We continue to drive strong commercial and operational execution resulting in full-year 2017 global operational sales growth of 10% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%,neg,train
But I think you can assume we've always demonstrated a strong commitment to our dividend and growing that dividend,neg,test
I think we've grown our dividend to 77% so far since we launched this new company,neg,train
And so I think you can assume that what I'm describing to you would be a combination of acceleration of the dividend growth and more share buybacks,neg,train
"It is our intent, my intent to review the proposal with the board at that point",neg,train
And we will make an announcement post that board meeting,neg,train
"As I mentioned earlier, today we have raised our guidance range to $7",neg,train
91 over the 2018 adjusted EPS guidance we provided during our third quarter call,neg,train
"More near-term, we expect to see data from several IMBRUVICA combination studies this year, including Phase III data in front-line CLL in combination with GAZYVA and front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with our CHOP",neg,train
"On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance",neg,train
"These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website",neg,train
"And then my second question on VENCLEXTA, can you just give us a little color on how you'd envision in the relapsed/refractory setting the pace of reaching peak market share",neg,train
"I know I think in the last quarterly update, I think IMBRUVICA had about 70% of the second-line setting, so just sort of can you walk through the mechanics and the timeframe you anticipate getting the peak penetration in the relapsed/refractory setting? Thanks",neg,train
"And then secondly at the same time, given that your stock has completely related that gives you additional strategic options that maybe you didn't have before when you were trading at a significant discount",neg,train
"Can you talk about your desire to use cash to acquire assets that might give you best-in-class growth post 2022? How are you thinking about M&A? I think that you have said thus far that you don't need it by anything big now, you've got a lot of growth obviously, but beyond 2022, 2023 when biosimilar has entered the U",neg,test
market that that sort of changes? So anyway those are my questions,neg,test
"With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs",neg,train
"So first thank you for the complement, we're certainly pleased with how the business has been performing as well",neg,train
"But I think if you look at our business, we're on fortunate position on two perspectives, and I’ll talk specifically about cash and how we think about capital deployment as well",neg,train
But we have a business to generate a tremendous amount of cash flow as you have highlighted and we have a business that is performing at a very high level and is capable of driving strong organic growth for the foreseeable future,neg,train
"HUMIRA, we expect first quarter sales growth over the prior year in the low-teens",neg,train
"Internationally, we expect operational sales growth in the mid single-digits",neg,train
"Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect a favorable impact from foreign currency resulting in reported global sales growth in the mid-teens",neg,train
sales in the first quarter to grow in the mid single-digits sequentially over the fourth quarter,neg,train
We have gotten reimbursement in many of the larger European countries and we've done quite well,neg,test
So Japan has approval and we are ramping rapidly in Japan,neg,train
"Strategically, we see an industry leading pipeline of late-stage de-risked assets and a productive R&D engine that has generated a pipeline of early-stage assets with transformational potential",neg,train
"In short, we see a high performing innovative company that is well positioned for the future",neg,train
"Finally, we are expecting a regulatory decision for elagolix in the second quarter",neg,train
We will provide specific guidance for this asset following approval when the duration of therapy and pricing have been established,neg,train
"We saw strong results from several pivotal trials, including data from three Phase III studies for upadacitinib in RA, four Phase III studies for risankizumab in psoriasis, and the MURANO study for VENCLEXTA in relapsed/refractory CLL among others",neg,train
And so those are always important factors that we look at,neg,train
"Today, I'll review the highlights of our performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and provide an overview of our 2018 outlook",neg,train
tax reform on our results as well as our expectations for the tax rate going forward,neg,test
"We also began registrational trials for several pipeline assets including Phase III studies in Crohn's disease for both upadacitinib and risankizumab, upadacitinib and psoriatic arthritis, VENCLEXTA in front-line AML, and Rova-T in front and second-line small-cell lung cancer",neg,train
"We expect to begin proof-of-concept studies this year for several key early-stage assets, including our CD40 antagonist ABBV-323, which will begin Phase II studies in ulcerative colitis, and our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination, ABBV-599, which will start Phase II in RA patients",neg,train
"On the topline in 2018, we expect revenue approaching $32 billion, which reflects a favorable impact from foreign currency of roughly 1",neg,train
Included in this guidance are the following assumptions for our key products,neg,train
HUMIRA will maintain its strong position as the leading front-line therapy across therapeutic segments and continue to be an important growth driver,neg,train
"In the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study, which evaluated upadacitinib as a monotherapy treatment for patients who did not adequately respond to methotrexate",neg,train
Both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and key secondary endpoints versus continued methotrexate therapy,neg,train
We are nearing completion of the registrational program for risankizumab and for upadacitinib and their lead indications psoriasis and RA respectively,neg,train
"We've prioritized areas of biology that we believe play an integral role in the tumor immune environment or in tumor growth, areas where we believe we can target with new therapies to have broader applicability than existing immuno-oncology agents or chemotherapy",neg,test
"If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors",neg,train
So I think from a business perspective over that five-year period you should think of the cash rate looking very similar to that rate,neg,train
5 billion payable over eight years and some of that’s backend loaded and given that we've taken that charge at 2017,neg,train
But other than that over the five-year period [indiscernible] pretty close,neg,train
AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements,neg,train
"AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law",neg,train
"So we feel good about the fundamentals and I'm not going to give you a new numbers, but I would tell you, I sleep well at night knowing how we're performing and where we're going in the future",neg,train
So I think that probably gives us some feel for it,neg,test
"For 2018, we are forecasting an operating margin of approximately 44%, roughly 150 basis points above 2017 inclusive of the incremental investments for our upcoming product launches",neg,train
"So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our pipeline and we look forward to many more important data readouts based transitions, regulatory submissions, and approvals in 2018",neg,train
I mean we went into the Stemcentrx acquisition with a level of enthusiasm around the Stemcentrx platform,neg,train
"But we have to see what the data looks like and we have to have interactions with the regulatory authorities, and so I would say nothing has changed",neg,train
But I don't know that we can predict more than that,neg,train
"Thank you very much, and again, congratulations on the results",neg,train
"So a few quick questions, first on HCV, your competitors suggested that they expect the U",neg,train
"market to stabilize sometime in the middle of the year both in terms of volume and also in terms of the price or the treatment cost for patient, wondering if that’s your expectation and what you're seeing",neg,train
"So as we've said now several times, pretax reform, if there was tax reform then we would look for a way to be able to return additional capital to shareholders",neg,train
"And we've been evaluating that for – actually last 45 days or so, when it became clear to us that tax reform is likely to occur",neg,train
We have a proposal that we have worked up in order for us to make changes in this area,neg,train
"We have Phase III studies ongoing in multiple myeloma as well as AML, where we have received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations",neg,train
"This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and 2017 highlights",neg,train
"As always, following our remarks, we will take your questions",neg,train
"We're blessed with a LRP that has very, very robust growth on the topline and obviously the bottom line",neg,train
"Therefore, our number one priority would not be to take down the absolute amount of leverage we have",neg,train
And so if you look at each of the segments and I'm going to do the sub-segments here in a minute,neg,train
"So if you look at RA, SpA, PsA, AS, psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC, we are number one in every single one of those categories",neg,train
"On the long-term guidance and the tax benefit, obviously we would expect the tax benefit to be able to flow through over time",neg,train
Now there's an interrelationship between what you would do from an M&A standpoint,neg,train
"So if you were to acquire something, that had a significant R&D burn going forward just like we did as an example with Stemcentrx and risankizumab, obviously you would dial in those R&D expenses",neg,train
"But I would say generally speaking, you should view the tax benefit as an incremental benefit that we flow through",neg,train
"Obviously, roughly 30% of those patients that are on some other kind of treatment today",neg,train
"There are some of those patients that are on treatment at all, which aren’t represented in that number",neg,train
"(NYSE:ABBV) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2018  9:00 AM ET",neg,train

This is inclusive of partnership accounting impacts and current exchange dynamics on hedged currencies,neg,train
"Over the next five years, we plan to invest roughly $2",neg,train
These studies are progressing well with key data becoming available in the 2019 time frame,neg,train
"Given the significant and durable activity we've already seen in AML and following recent regulatory feedback, we now plan to submit our U",neg,test
"The next thing you want to look at is what is your first-line share, and what I'm going to quote you is IMS date, which we consider to be the most reliable source of data",neg,train
And this is data from January through October which is the latest data points that we have,neg,train
"And so with respect to SELECT-COMPARE, that study remains blinded",neg,train
"I think what might be causing some confusion about an October 2017 data is that study has two components, traditional response based on ACR and DAS measures, and then a longer term structural component of that program, looking for innovation of structural progression, and the study remains blinded until that structural component is complete",neg,test
tax reform which will lower our tax rate going forward,neg,train
"Factoring in both items, we now expect full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7",neg,train
"The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 32%, with the majority of the projected growth being driven by strong underlying operating performance",neg,train
This guidance positions AbbVie to be in the top-tier for earnings per share growth once again in 2018,neg,train
Bill will provide more details regarding our 2018 guidance later on in this call,neg,test
We recently submitted our regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA plus RITUXAN in relapsed/refractory CLL based on the MURANO data,neg,test
We expect an approval for this indication later this year and look forward to bringing this new treatment to market in the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population,neg,train
"These include the tumor microenvironment, innate immune cell activation, tumor cell intrinsic resistance, cancer stem cells, epigenetic regulation, and therapies based on engineered T-cell receptors",neg,test
We have more than 20 solid tumor assets currently in the clinic and expect to move several more into Phase I studies over the course of the year,neg,train
We look forward to sharing the data from these programs as they mature,neg,train
This represents a significant acceleration of our program as approval in AML later this year or in early 2019 would be approximately two years ahead of our initial expectations,neg,train
We look forward to bringing this new treatment option to the substantial group of AML patients who can't receive high-dose induction chemotherapy,neg,train
We also saw a strong performance from several other products in our base business,neg,train
"We now modeled a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 9% in 2018, increasing gradually to 13% within the next five years as a result of increased domestic income and investment",neg,train
We anticipate a lower GAAP tax rate in 2018 due to the one-time benefit of the timing of the phase-in of provisions of the new law on certain foreign subsidiaries,neg,train
This benefit will be excluded from our non-GAAP EPS in 2018,neg,train
"In addition to RA, Phase III studies with upadacitinib are ongoing in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease and upadacitinib is also being evaluated as a potential treatment for ankylosing spondylitis",neg,train
"We plan to begin registration enabling studies this year in atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, and giant cell arteritis",neg,train
"Earlier this month, upadacitinib received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation in atopic dermatitis, based on the strong Phase II data we have previously reported",neg,train
We plan to present detailed results from the Phase II study at the AAD Meeting next month,neg,test
"We submitted regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA in relapsed/refractory CLL, and for elagolix in endometriosis, which is currently under priority review",neg,train
"And we received several regulatory approvals including MAVYRET in HCV, and two approvals for IMBRUVICA, marginal zone lymphoma and chronic graft-versus-host disease",neg,train
"And while we made significant advancements across our pipeline in 2017, 2018 will mark another milestone-filled year for AbbVie, which Mike will discuss in detail during his remarks in just a few moments",neg,test
"In late 2018 to 2019, Rova-T will begin to contribute",neg,train
Each of these assets will add significantly to AbbVie's already strong growth,neg,train
"Bill, back on tax this year, the non-GAAP rate for this year and up through the 13% rate, will the cash rate approximate those levels as well? And secondly, Rick I know you're not changing long-term guidance, but conceptually would it be fair to assume that the tax benefits that you now know about sort of flow through fully or would you reassess sort of reinvestment rates, and Mike lastly anything new on what's next for 414? Thanks",neg,train
"On the long-term guidance fundamentals, I mean clearly when you look at our business, our business added space fundamentals excluding the positive impact that we've seen from tax reform is very strong",neg,train
"And what we have projected on our long-term guidance, I think is certainly in the top tier of our peer group",neg,train
We have achieved market leadership in most of the markets where we have launched,neg,test
", MAVYRET exited 2017 with a market share of 32%, conforming our expectations that the product will be our highly competitively positioned product within the HCV market",neg,train
Sales growth in the quarter benefited from the timing of tenders in select markets which contributed approximately 2,neg,train
"HUMIRA remains the undisputed market leader across the broadest range of therapeutic indications, reflecting its strong position with physicians, unique product profile, and strong commercial execution",neg,train
"And finally, in the area of women's health, our regulatory application for elagolix in endometriosis is currently under priority review and we anticipate an approval decision in the second quarter",neg,train
"In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase III studies ongoing in uterine fibroids and we will see data from this program later this quarter",neg,train
I think you should just model that pretty much a straight line linear,neg,train
It really does not impact any one-year more than others,neg,train
"So for modeling purposes, I just pretty much straight line it linearly",neg,train
"Moving now to our other late stage immunology asset, upadacitinib and oral selective JAK1 inhibitor currently in clinical development for six indications across the rheum, derm, and GI segments",neg,train
"Last month, we reported topline results from the third Phase III study from a registrational program and RA",neg,test
"This is a brand, if you look at the last three or four years, it has grown dramatically",neg,train
"The percent growth rate has come down somewhat as the brand has grown, but if you look at the absolute dollar growth, it's been fairly consistent and extremely healthy",neg,train
So it starts with what is your position in managed care,neg,train
And I would say we're now done with all of our negotiations in 2018,neg,test
"We maintain a very, very strong managed care position in the United States",neg,train
We delivered another impressive quarter and year with results ahead of our expectations,neg,train

48 representing growth of more than 23% versus the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
Our quarterly results also included strong topline performance with global operational sales growth of more than 12%,neg,train
"We continue to see strong momentum from our business with three major drivers contributing to our growth; HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, and MAVYRET",neg,train
I think you mentioned in the comments you are making some proactive actions ahead of biosimilars competition,neg,train
I wish you could say a little bit what you're doing there and more broadly just updated thoughts about how you see managing the HUMIRA franchise as we think about biosimilars entering the market later this year? Thanks so much,neg,test
"On VENCLEXTA, I think what you’re describing is an important phenomenon",neg,train
So IMBRUVICA does have roughly about 70% of the treated population in relapsed/refractory today,neg,train
We would not expect the patients will be – well maintained patients will be taken off of IMBRUVICA,neg,train
"Based on these results, we believe that VENCLEXTA in combination with RITUXAN has the potential to be a new standard chemotherapy free treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL",neg,train
"So if I look at 2018, what we have built in is a typical level of share repurchase that we normally have, so we have not built in the incremental share repurchase that we would do",neg,test
"And I do normally say, congratulations Rick and team on spectacular performance",neg,train
"I want to talk about – ask about you're sitting on a pile of cash that's just going to continue to grow and even more or so with your lower tax rate, you talked about wanting to return that cash to shareholders, and one of those forms is through an increased dividend",neg,train
So I don't want to preempt what the payout ratio would be,neg,train
"What you describe here is not an illogical way of thinking about it, but beyond that I wouldn’t want to comment much, but I would say investors are going to have clarity on it in the month of February",neg,train
So it's not too far off before you'll have a good idea of what we're describing,neg,train
"Beyond small-cell lung cancer, the neuroendocrine tumor BASKET study continues to progress",neg,train
And we will be sharing more results from this study as the data mature possibly later this year,neg,test
"In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we continue to build capabilities and explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market",neg,train
"In closing, we delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and our guidance for 2018 puts us among the top of our industry peers once again with the midpoint of our EPS guidance range representing growth of 32%",neg,train
"First Bill, you said the tax rate post 2018 would increase gradually to 13%",neg,train
"Can you provide some perspective as to the pace of the increase from the 9% that you're guiding to in 2018? And then on ABT-494, the SELECT-COMPARE trial had a primary completion in October of 2017",neg,train
It's an important trial given that it's the largest of the SELECT trials,neg,train
Can you say anything on the safety profile that you've seen in SELECT-COMPARE? Thank you very much,neg,train
"Moving now to VENCLEXTA, at the recent ASH Meeting, we reported detailed results from the Phase III MURANO study in relapsed/refractory CLL, which showed a profound improvement in progression free survival and strong rates of MRD negativity with combination treatment of VENCLEXTA and RITUXAN compared to BR",neg,train
But I think it would be helpful to maybe more broadly layout for you how we see HUMIRA in the U,neg,train
", and then Bill can answer the specifics around volume and price",neg,train
"Certainly it’s a volume driven business primarily, but Bill can give you more specifics around that",neg,train
"Second, really any thoughts here on the long-term guide, it's clear it's not just tax, the underlying fundamentals keep improving as well",neg,train
Is it fair to say that there's potential headroom particularly on margins and revenue for your longer term guidance when you recently put out,neg,train
"And then just that – just because I still get a lot of pushback on it, I wonder if you might let – care to express a level of confidence around ability to file and launch Rova-T this year, any reason why it shouldn't be 100%? Thank you",neg,train
"1% on an operational basis, excluding a modest favorable impact from foreign exchange",neg,train
"For the fourth quarter, total adjusted net revenues were $7",neg,train
"Beyond psoriasis, risankizumab is also in mid to late stage development for several other indications, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis",neg,train
"We recently initiated, Phase III studies in Crohn's disease and expect to begin registrational studies later this year in ulcerative colitis",neg,train
"First question just on the tax guidance out the five years, just curious is it sort of – the only reason you gave out the five years, it’s hard to know what will happen in five years time or should we read into anything with regards to your portfolio composition changing in HUMIRA in five years time, potentially changing as a proportion of your profit mix?",neg,train
"So HCV, if we look at the market in the U",neg,train
", looking at the two parameters we are describing, one is treatment volumes",neg,train
"It's a little difficult to predict whether or not it was more holiday driven, but I’d say it's down 5% to 8% from where it was prior",neg,train
"in 2018, we expect sales growth of approximately 13% to 14%",neg,train
This guidance assumes current exchange rates and includes the impact of direct biosimilar entrants in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as proactive actions taken in earlier quarters,neg,train
"Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our Helium container business and our corporate costs",neg,train
"Sales and profits were down, primarily driven by lower LNG project activity",neg,train
"For FY18, we still don’t expect an earnings headwind for the corporate segment",neg,train
"If you look at all of the projects you signed in the roaster you've given, how much of that $9 billion total have you deployed thus far?",neg,train
And I would say being our flexibility in changing had a lot to do with the fact that it was a new customer stepping in,neg,train
"But overall, Lawrence -- overall when you look at the projects that we have taken and the onsite projects that we have taken and as they come onstream, their margins, they are not going to have a negative effect on our margins",neg,train
"Therefore, we expect to maintain an EBITDA margin, as we have said before, of somewhere between around 32% to 35%",neg,train
And none of the projects that we have taken is going to cause that margin to go down,neg,train
I think I'll turn it over to Corning to expand on that,neg,train
"But what I want say is that these so called planned maintenance cost are -- basically the big money is in our hydrogen facilities and those things, the timing of those, is not under our control, it's under control of our customers",neg,train
"And a lot of our customers are having turnaround this year, and each one of these turnarounds is $20 million to $30 million of expense",neg,train
"So that it's timing, but it is a necessary thing that we need to do",neg,train
When you’re bidding for this large ASUs and large syngas plant in China? And then what kind of competitors or competition do you run into for these large projects?,neg,train
"For 2019, we expect a cash tax reduction from the tax act of about $70 million to $80 million with the positive impact of the full year of the lower tax rate, and the immediate expensing of capital investments being partially offset by the first payment of the deemed to repatriation of foreign earnings",neg,train
"Finally, please turn to slide 21 for a brief comment on our global gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sales equipment business, as well as central industrial gas business cost",neg,train
"Sales were down $15 million while profits were up slightly, driven by the Jazan project",neg,train
And you talked about the environmental advantage of coal gasification,neg,train
"What are the risk to coal gasification? Let's say, if China implements carbon tax in the future",neg,train
"15 as we had some positive items last year that didn't repeat, as well as well as higher planned maintenance cost and inflation",neg,test
"As a reminder, included in the cost major factors, is the other income and expense line on the consolidated P&L",neg,train
"As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik",neg,train
The cost to provide these services are primarily in SG&A,neg,train
The payment we received for this service was about $6 million this quarter and is shown in the other income and expense line,neg,test
This does not dilute our focus on being the safest and most profitable,neg,train
Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today,neg,train
"Now please turn to slide number 10 to discuss some of the -- or read some of our recent successes to grow Air Products in line with what I just described, which is consistent with our strategy",neg,train
"Scott, maybe I could just ask you to give us some help on Americas margin sequentially, just given you had the maintenance in this quarter, the wholesale thing and then are there any positive things that's replaced last year that wont’s recur in the second quarter",neg,train
We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America,neg,train
"The impact from pricing is maybe 50 basis points or so, something like that at the company…",neg,train
"We have one quarter 35, three quarters of [20 million]",neg,train
We’re required to take an estimate and blend that together,neg,train
"But as you pointed too, we had a even after adjusted for the new tax act",neg,train
"We had a little bit lower ATR here in the first quarter, principally driven by the accounting for share based compensation",neg,train
"So when we look at that and we talked about in total versus last year, maybe we’re down about 370 basis points",neg,train
Now 260 of which is coming from the tax act and the balance of that 110 is from the share based comp,neg,test
Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a comment on our corporate segment,neg,test
Approximately 40% is syngas and about 60% is the traditional business,neg,train
Let me provide some more background on the Asia contract termination and associated plant sale,neg,train
"One of our onsite steel customers in China had a change in ownership, and approached us to end our long term supply agreement with them and purchase the plant from us",neg,train
"The customer had no contractual right to do this, but we are satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation and are pleased to reduce our long term exposure to this customer",neg,train
"We recognize the sales and profit from the sale of equipment this quarter, but will not see the sales and profit from the sale of gas going forward",neg,train
"And then if I assume that you sold it for about 12 times, would that mean that the underlying profit that’s going to go away that we’ve seen from plant historically is about $10 million a year or $2",neg,test
We’ll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS,neg,train
And just on pricing Seifi what type of price traction are you seeing in the U,neg,train
"Excluding the contract termination and plant sale, EBITDA increased 26% due to the strong volumes, higher pricing and favorable currency",neg,train
We are incurring higher distribution and sourcing costs to support our growing retail business,neg,train
"We think this is the right course of action, and the new business is certainly contributing",neg,train
"I think, the big positive for us in Asia is pricing right now and you'd add on to that volume leverage and incremental loading, it’s those things that are pulling us forward",neg,train
I would say maybe if you're just building on it like a highly motivated team that's again organized by sub-regions all of them with our own incentive plan on their own actual results,neg,train
"So they are just driven to let’s get the volume and let's get the price, and let's take advantage of this opportunity to absolutely the fullest",neg,train
"Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about Air Products' future",neg,train
"As I discussed earlier, we are very proud of having delivered on our promises from two years ago",neg,train
"Our safety, productivity and operating performance continues to be strong",neg,train
We continue to be optimistic about the future of Air Products,neg,train
We obviously cannot predict and we do not have control over worldwide political or economic developments,neg,train
"But we do have control over the operational and growth performance of Air Products, and we feel confident we can continue to deliver on our goals",neg,train
"EBITDA was up 18% compared to prior year, again primarily due to the new plant in India with higher-merchant sales and positive currency also contributing",neg,train
"EBITDA margin of 32% was down 320 basis points, almost completely due to higher energy cost pass through versus last year and the new plant in India, which has comparatively higher natural gas costs",neg,train
"Excluding these factors, EBITDA margin was down only 20 basis points, primarily due to a large planned maintenance outage in the quarter",neg,train
"EBITDA was down 9% sequentially on the planned outage cost, lower OIE and higher seasonal power costs",neg,train
Any financial metrics you can share with us on that project?,neg,train
"I guess, if you can just clarify that a little bit",neg,train
"If your merchant pricing already before things get tight is a 50 basis point tailwind then over three or four years, it's probably going to be a little bit more of a tailwind from here",neg,test
"And if your rest is basically flattish, shouldn't you be to overshoot the 35% or what's the offset that you see?",neg,train
Can you give a little bit more detail on how much of a tailwind you had globally from merchant pricing in the quarter,neg,train
"Are the acquisitions of plants and the syngas projects, both margin accretive or does one offset the other to some extent",neg,train
"And maybe if I could just build on that, Jeff, I feel obviously with the deferred taxes, there is some timing that might even go further out",neg,test
Its just in the timeframe of the eight years maybe we have to take that a little longer,neg,train
"Now, please turn to slide 19, to review our Europe, Middle East and Africa business",neg,train
"Sales were up 29% with volumes up 17%, energy costs pass through up 3% and currency up 9%",neg,train
"Our new hydrogen plant in India completing its second full quarter of operation drove a significant portion of the sales growth, while our merchant business contributed 3% volume growth",neg,train
"As a reminder, this 100% owned India hydrogen facility is reported in the EMEA segment while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in the Asia equity affiliate income",neg,train
"Overall, pricing was slightly positive but rounded to flat as higher real pricing was partially offset by customer and product mix",neg,train
"Yes, so I think you’re just interested in the market conditions",neg,train
So I’first say I think underlying hydrogen demand remains really quite strong,neg,train
"And we've seen a little bit in this period as we had the cold weathers in the Gulf coast, but I would say we bounce back from that very quickly",neg,train
"And at this point, our customers are pretty nearly fully backed as well",neg,train
Oil field services is probably a change for the higher oil field prices,neg,train
"But by enlarge, I'd say there’s just broad based strength in North America right now",neg,train
You can actually capture that and then put into for enhanced oil recovery in a lot of other applications,neg,train
"And most importantly, we have a great team, totally focused on delivering strong operating performance, while successfully winning exciting new growth opportunities",neg,train
"And then Corning, could you remind us why you split India between EMEA and Asia",neg,train
Is it how you have your hydrogen group reporting up globally versus maybe regional on the industrial gas on the atmospheric gas side?,neg,train
"No, none of the old gasifiers are polluting, gasification is a very clean way of using coal",neg,train
But I'd like to hand it over to Corning to expand on that,neg,train
"is growing, Europe is growing and our margins, but we are losing any margin, it is just quarter-by-quarter",neg,train
"So fundamentally, we are very confident about what's going on and we are actually feel pretty strong about that",neg,train
We will go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs for a question,neg,train
Turning now to our Q1 results on slide number 14,neg,train
"As Seifi mentioned, this was another record quarterly EPS, congratulations to the whole Air Products’ team",neg,train
2 billion increased 18% versus last year as volume plus price were up 15% and currency added 3%,neg,test
"Volumes were up 13% with positive contributions from all three regions, driven by a new plants, a contract termination and associated plant sale in Asia and base business growth; the Asia plant sale was about 6% of the growth; new plants were about 5% and base business growth was about 2%; pricing was up 2%, driven by the China merchant business; currency was positive, driven by the Euro, British Pound and Chinese RMB",neg,test
"The return on that project is well above the guidance that we've told you, which is so called 10% internal rate of return, it's well above that",neg,train
"As usual, Duffy, you are very good at doing your math",neg,train
"Turning to slide 17, I would like to update you on our capital deployment capacity",neg,train
We have just over $3 billion of cash and short term investments as of December 31st,neg,train
"After maintaining a modest operating cash balance, we have just under $3 billion of cash available to invest",neg,train
Our debt balance as of December 31st is about $3,neg,train
We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of approximately 2,neg,train
"Question on the merchant business, I can see the merchant operating leverage in China and the margin impact it had there",neg,train
"Sequentially, EBITDA was down 4%, primarily due to planned maintenance outage cost and lower OIE",neg,train
Net income increased 23% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 22% versus prior year,neg,train
9% declined by 80 basis points versus last year and 20 basis points sequentially despite the profit increase,neg,train
This is because the denominator or the ROCE calculation has increased,neg,train
The denominator is based on the five quarter average and this now includes four quarters with the significantly higher denominator as a result of the gain from the PMD sale,neg,train
"But Jeff to be very specific, the operating rates right now in U",neg,train
Usually in industrial gases business when your operating rates gets to around 80% then you have significant pricing leverage and that is what is happening in China,neg,train
"Rest assured, we are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident that the risk return profile will create significant value for our shareholders",neg,train
I would like to -- that is the net amount of cash that will go out of the company in the next eight years,neg,train
"But against that, obviously, we have the benefit of lower cash cost in the United States because of the lower tax rate",neg,train
"So when you balance that, you can calculate the real net present value",neg,test
"Now please turn to slide number seven, where I would like to again remind everyone of the progress we have made in the last three years",neg,train
"We have divested our non-core assets and created the best balance sheet in the industry, and we have delivered greater than 10% per year EPS growth in each of the last three years, and our guidance for this year implies another year of over 10% growth",neg,train
Just wanted to flush out a little bit more of the plant sale,neg,train
So just going off your 20% in the volume number in the Delta that Corning gave of 12% EBITDA,neg,train
"If you calculate it, is about $130 million sale price in about $22 million of profit that you recognized in EBITDA",neg,train
Is that the right way to strip out to get an underlying?,neg,train
"At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Yes, so I think your questions are probably about Europe and the Americas",neg,train
"Obviously, in Asia it's quite a strong story for us",neg,train
"Both in Europe and in the Americas, we have positive net pricing",neg,train
"So same molecule, same customer year-on-year have been able to move those prices? Yes we have",neg,train
"We do have a challenge with mix, which is typically larger customers just simply growing more in the current environment, taking more product year-on-year and in some degrees, mix of which molecules are being bought",neg,train
"But I'd say there's, in terms of real activity and real pricing, meaning same customer, same molecule, there's progress",neg,train
Are there any metrics you can share with us on that project?,neg,test
"EBITDA of $735 million improved by 12%, driven by the higher volumes and China pricing",neg,train
"The Asia contract termination and plant sale negatively impacted margins by about 90 basis points, and the significant amount of energy pass-through on the hydrogen plant in India due to the high natural gas prices negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points",neg,train
"Excluding these two items, EBITDA margins were down 30 basis points, primarily due to higher planned maintenance cost",neg,train
"We are certainly working on other opportunities that could potentially add to our results in fiscal 2018, but have not included any other significant acquisition in our guidance for now",neg,train
"I don't think we want to really give a clear roadmap exactly where all our strategic options are in China, at this point",neg,train
Our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times,neg,test
"On the slide number six, you can see our five point plan, which has been the roadmap to our success",neg,train
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr,neg,train
"Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail",neg,train
"Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon, to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions",neg,train
"Continuing our positive momentum, we have increased our guidance for fiscal year 2018 to a range of 715 to 735",neg,train
"25 of this is coming from the new tax act, with the remaining increase from improved confidence in our business performance",neg,train
Our new guidance represents 13% to 16% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance,neg,train
"We are running through the standard competitors, you know who they are and we compete with them on the basis of -- its not just the price, I would like to make -- its not just the financial returns, it’s the combination of the trust that -- relationship that we have with the customer, the demonstration that we have delivered, our technology",neg,train
Now we are going to have an advantage with the acquisition of the Shell technology,neg,train
So it’s a combination of all of things like we compete and we compete with the people basically that we have been competing with for many years,neg,train
"Well, the thing is that if they implement -- about this coal gasification do P",neg,train
"So whatever tax they put in, it just increases the price of the chemical, because they can't say okay I'm not going to do coal gasification",neg,train
"So if you are not going to do coal gasification, what are you going to do? Then you have to buy out of these chemicals and import them into the country",neg,train
Service cost remain in operating income as these represent the benefits earned in the current period by planned purchase events,neg,train
"Again, just to emphasize, this doesn’t change our pension and overall cost we just moved to small component of cost from within operating income to non-operating income",neg,train
"We view this updated historical information for prior period comparisons and the results reported today, and you can find a summary in an appendix slide and more detailed consolidated and segment information in the 8-K we filed today",neg,train
Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference,neg,train
"And I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases",neg,train
"After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions",neg,test
The Lu'An project we described before is a perfect example of this area of growth for us,neg,train
We expect to do more of these in the coming years,neg,train
"As Seifi mentioned, we did close on a few acquisitions during Q1 and have included these in our CapEx and earnings guidance",neg,train
"Our total growth CapEx for Q1, including the acquisitions is about $400 million",neg,train
And just a quick derivative question from trends in the Chinese merchant market in terms of lines and price,neg,train
"And so I think as I said in my prepare remarks then to going forward, for the full year, maybe it's a 20 to 21 rate to be used",neg,train
"And then when we look at it at the timing and the implementation of the various elements of the tax act, you’ve got to -- at this point in time, these are all best estimates",neg,train
But I think that's a reasonable type of the rate we carry into 19 as well,neg,train
"Its not so much that we replaced the wholesale volume molecule by molecule, plant by plant",neg,train
"In Latin America, we also achieved higher merchant gases volumes versus prior-year",neg,train
"Overall, pricing impact was slightly positive but rounded to flat as higher North American pricing was partially offset by negative mix",neg,train
"9 billion, this would support a debt level in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion",neg,train
"So in total, between our available cash and additional debt capacity, we've about $6 billion we can deploy today while maintaining our A/A2 rating",neg,train
The Yankuang project that we announced is another great example of that,neg,train
"that customer then got acquired by another steel company, who was less bought in, let's say, into the sale of gas concept",neg,train
"They wanted to just -- and are basically good faith negotiations, understanding their thought process, how they look to things",neg,test
We thought the termination that we came up with was a good win-win for us,neg,train
"I just point out in the same quarter, we have examples of where we've taken a plant that was going to be an SOE and we’ve converted it into a cell of gas",neg,train
"Kevin, I think when we have a disruption in the market, it's never a positive for us",neg,train
"But I would just say the guidance that we have given reflects our expectations for the quarter, including what's happened in terms of weather",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"We also continue to make progress on finalizing the contract, and we'll keep you updated",neg,test
"Finally, earlier to speak, we announced an agreement to supply syngas to BPCL’s phase 2 petrochemical project in Kochi, India",neg,train
Our new facility will be integrated with the large plant we brought on stream in 2017 to supply their refinery,neg,train
"(NYSE:APD) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
We had another strong cash flow quarter in Q1 with distributable cash flow up almost $100 million to over $500 million,neg,train
You'll see we've an updated slide that more closely aligns with our current situation,neg,train
"It is after we pay interest, taxes, maintenance CapEx and dividends",neg,train
"Well, in terms of M&A opportunities, we do see opportunities outside of China",neg,train
"I don't want to say more than that, but we are working on some of that",neg,train
"In terms of the Praxair and Linde thing, we have to wait and see what actually comes out",neg,train
"5 billion of sale, which would have about probably about $300 million to $350 million of EBITDA",neg,train
Now please turn to slide 18 for a review of our gases Americas results,neg,train
"For the quarter, sales were up 5% on higher volumes, hydrogen demand was strong, particularly in the Gulf Coast as were North American merchant volumes, even including the impact of the end of a large wholesale contract",neg,train
"That is obviously a very positive development for us, because the push obviously from an environmental point of view is to use less coal for producing power",neg,train
"So all of the push for the environmental thing is actually very positive thing for us and that is why if you study the details of China's 13 and five year plan, there is a significant number of projects designated for coal gasification",neg,test
"Please turn to slide 20, gases Asia, where our business continue to deliver strong growth, strong sales and profit growth",neg,train
"Sales were up 47%, including the sale that Scott mentioned earlier",neg,train
"Underlying volumes were up 8%, driven by new plant on streams and 3% contribution from the merchant business",neg,train
"In addition to strong base merchant pricing, we had a particularly significant spot sale, which concluded in January and will not repeat",neg,train
"But in terms of reporting that you are talking about, in terms of how we report that, quite honestly traditionally, we have been reporting that that way and we didn’t want to change that, if not to confuse the numbers",neg,train
"But on operationally, we run Middle-East and India separate from Europe",neg,train
"But in terms of the reporting the results, we put all of that together because we didn’t want to create a lot of confusion about comparison to previous years",neg,test
"So, the gasification has a set in which you remove that sulphur after we gasified it",neg,train
"So I mean literally coal which you can't really legally use in other applications, you can use it here because we're going to get the sulphur out",neg,train
And another element is that there was an incentive around carbon capture,neg,train
Coal gasification has the benefit of giving you a very concentrated stream of CO2 that would be easier to work within almost any other process,neg,train
"So over the next three years, we expect to have a total of at least $9 billion available to invest, not including extra capacity created by EBITDA contributions from investing in profitable projects",neg,train
"On slide 15, I might have missed this, Scott, but you show a price component and a cost component to the EPS",neg,train
Can you talk why the costs were up 2x the price?,neg,train
"Do you expect that to be good, bad, or neutral to your results in the fiscal second quarter? Just trying to think about the net effect of how are costs versus any customer outages that you see?",neg,train
"Before I discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to provide a brief summary of the impacts we expect the U",neg,train
Tax Cuts in Jobs Act to have on Air Products,neg,train
"Is your interest in coal derived syngas driven more by growth prospects for that process, or would you say you bring to it a technological advantage, given coal derived gasifications been around a long time over there",neg,train
"Do you have a technological advantage, either from your ASU technology or with the Shell technology you acquired",neg,train
"Finally, let me comment on the expected cash tax impact",neg,train
"For full year 2018, we expect a modest reduction in cash taxes from the new tax act of about $15 million to $20 million as the benefit from the lower corporate tax rate is mostly offset by the tax on the expected repatriation of foreign cash from subsidiaries and joint ventures",neg,train
So we would still expect cash taxes in the range of about $400 million for 2018,neg,train
Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment and motivation of the rest of our team all over the world who work hard to run our company to the highest level of performance,neg,train
"Yes, our competitive advantage comes from the commitment and motivation of our people",neg,train
I consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team,neg,train
For our next question we'll go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust,neg,test
We’ll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities,neg,train
"With that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call",neg,train
Thanks for taking time from your busier schedule to listen to our presentation,neg,train
We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter,neg,train
"For quarter two of fiscal year 2018, our earning per share guidance is $1",neg,train
"70, which is up 15% to 19% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2017",neg,train
"Excluding the tax act impact, our quarter two guidance is still up 12% to 15% over last year",neg,train
"As I mentioned before, and I'd like to stress this, our EPS and CapEx guidance do not include any contribution from the Lu'An project or any future M&A opportunity",neg,train
Now I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook,neg,train
"But that is the primary reason that we wanted to buy the Shell technology, because now we will have a technological advantage",neg,train
You're getting us into trying to give guidance now for '19 and '20,neg,train
"But I think you are on the right track to assuming that the overall conditions are positive for Air Products and our margins and we agree with that, but I don't want to",neg,train
"Scott mentioned this a little, but in IG Americas, there was some planned maintenance around which hit margins, but volumes appear pretty solid in the merchant business, as well as hydrogen",neg,train
Can you just give a little more color on these fronts just for the balance of the year and just anything of note will be greatly appreciated? Thanks,neg,train
I guess that there’s now $5 billion less that hasn't been allocated out to $9 billion from answer to previous question,neg,train
"Given the change in the tax environment in the United States, are you focused at all anymore or focused at all incrementally on putting some of that money to work in the U",neg,train
"Within China, obviously, there is a lot of environmentalism that seems beginning some traction, and maybe a move away from coal as a fuel source",neg,train
"Can you talk about how that’s impacting it all, the growth potential for coal to go into liquids and chemicals?",neg,train
This is down from recent quarters as the Evonik TSA ended during Q1,neg,train
We expect the Versum TSA to finish at the end of Q2,neg,test
"We remain committed to taking actions to reduce the cost associated with providing these services, but would expect to see a brief gap between the end of the TSA income and the cost savings",neg,train
"06 favorable, primarily due to the Euro, British pound and RMB",neg,test
"03 due to underlying strength across a number of our JVs, particularly in Mexico",neg,train
Note that this excludes the new tax act related charge I mentioned earlier,neg,train
"Volumes for all three industrial gas regional segments were up this quarter from a combination of new plants coming onstream, overall stronger merchant sales and the China plants that Scott mentioned",neg,train
"So we feel that the underlying demand merchant gases, hydrogen and the whole package remains very strong",neg,train
We're going to have other maintenance during the course of the year,neg,train
"And so sequential-to-sequential, we don't really map out exactly as our maintenance spending is coming out",neg,train
But I would say the overall picture one that's strengthening in the Americas,neg,train
"Yes, I would say that's a reflection of -- at point in time when we did that",neg,test
"Clearly, at this point, we’re tremendously beefing up our syngas capabilities in Asia, however",neg,train
"The only non-GAAP items we had this quarter were related to the new tax act, and totaled $1",neg,train
08 for the contract termination of plant sale in China,neg,train
Price and raw materials taken together increased the EPS by $0,neg,train
Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts,neg,train
Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release,neg,train
We’ll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Capital,neg,train
"For FY17, this resulted in modest increase in operating income and EBITDA of about $4 million and increases margins by 10 basis points",neg,train
"This change provides a better reflection of our operating performance by moving the historically more volatile components of pension expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of deferred amounts to non-operating",neg,test
"However, as we did in October, due to some uncertainty in the timing of the necessary government approvals, we have not, and I'd like to stress, we have not included any contribution from Lu'An project in our EPS or CapEx guidance for fiscal year '18",neg,train
We will continue to keep you updated on our progress,neg,train
So I am just wondering like you had talked before about having $8 billion or so to invest over a number of years,neg,train
"Half of that, all of it, how much of it could being in syngas at the end of the day?",neg,train
I'd just like to stress on that Chris that we are very positive about the developments in China,neg,test
And welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals' First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call,neg,train
Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products,neg,test
Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved,neg,train
"When you look at your backlog, how much of your backlog has been hydrogen and syngas and how much of your backlog has been the traditional industrial gases, oxygen and nitrogen, argon, those sorts of things",neg,train
"EBITDA margin, excluding the contract termination and plant sale, was up 240 basis points",neg,train
"As Seifi mentioned, we announced the number of exciting new projects in Asia for coal gasification to produce syngas, ASU purchases and two awards for new long-term supply agreements with Samsung in Korea",neg,train
"So in North America, we of course has the challenge of absorbing a loss of a large wholesale agreement that we had",neg,train
I just want to say that's a good accomplishment by the team,neg,train
"But it’s both same factors when we report out our numbers that Scott mentioned that are challenge in that, so the higher maintenance cost and some positives from last year not repeating",neg,train
"The new business that we’re signing, however, is certainly the contributing to the overall results",neg,train
"In summary, we have delivered what we promised and now we are well positioned to grow Air Products",neg,train
The great thing is that we do have the balance sheet to do it,neg,train
"First, let me talk about the income statement impact for Q1",neg,test
"tax rate under the new tax act was not affected until January 1, 2018, which is after the end of our fiscal Q1, this quarter's results reflect our estimated blended tax rate for the full year as required",neg,train
We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners,neg,train
So this fiscal September '17 I guess has three quarters of benefit,neg,train
And I assume the December quarter recruit essentially a quarter of those three quarters of benefit,neg,train
"I am just trying to understand why the tax rate is even lower in the December quarter? And will this fiscal ‘19 tax rate go down a little bit more, because you'll have four quarters of benefit in '19?",neg,train
Our talented and committed Air Products team delivered another excellent quarter,neg,train
"For the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, our record earning per share of $1",neg,train
This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth,neg,train
This is also the third consecutive quarter we have delivered EPS growth of more than 15%,neg,train
"We generated strong cash flow and are pleased to announce a dividend increase of 15% per share or 16%, the largest per share increase in our history",neg,test
"40 per share, which equals to returning almost $1 billion per year to our shareholders",neg,train
"And on the demand side, would you say that most of these new projects that are coal derived syngas are incremental production capacity projects or retrofits of old gasifiers that are inefficient and air polluting and need to be shuttered?",neg,train
"Certainly, dividend payments create value, and given our 36 year track record of raising dividends, we don't expect this to change",neg,train
Investible cash flows what we've been describing is more than $1 billion per year,neg,train
You can see we generated almost $350 million of investible cash flow in Q1,neg,train

You can see the significant progress we continue to make on improving our safety results with a reduction of 71% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 52% in our recordable injury rate,neg,test
"This improvement only happens when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are totally focused on safety and operational excellence",neg,train
This same commitment is also driving our strong financial performance,neg,train
Turning now to the tax related non-GAAP items this quarter that totaled a negative $239 million or $1,neg,train
Please keep in mind these are based on our current reasonable estimates,neg,train
"We had a charge of $453 million to recognize the liability associated with the deemed repatriation of the foreign earnings, with about $32 million recorded in equity affiliate income",neg,train
The deemed repatriation tax will be paid over the next eight years,neg,train
"Partially offsetting the charge, we had a benefit of $214 million due to revaluing our U",neg,train
deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower tax rate,neg,train
EBITDA was up 1% compared to prior year as contributions from higher volumes and better equity affiliate income more than offset higher planned maintenance outage costs and the wholesale contract termination impact,neg,train
These factors and lower margin sale of equipment caused the margin to be down 160 basis points,neg,train
"Sequentially, EBITDA was down 12% and margin was 310 basis points lower, primarily driven by the planned maintenance, outage costs, seasonally weaker volume demand and the wholesale impact",neg,train
"As we move into Q2, we’ve seen some modest negative customer demand and feedstock and utility impacts from the very cold weather in the U",neg,train
"And in commentary, you said that repatriation impacts would be about negative 453 and then there's the revaluation of deferred taxes",neg,train
"Should we look at that $239 as the amount of additional cash taxes that you'll pay over the next eight years, excluding the annual changes to your normal corporate rate?",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Lawrence Alexander with Jefferies,neg,train
The fundamental thing is that coal is the only energy source that China has,neg,train
"As a result, their only option, if they want to be independent, is to turn that coal into chemicals and syngas",neg,train
"Otherwise, they would have to import that, which is what they do right now",neg,train
That is why this is a high priority for the government,neg,train
"And coal gasification has the advantage of being able to use 2%, 3% high sulphur coal that you cant do anything else with it",neg,train
"With the syngas stuff, how big in the portfolio would you be comfortable letting the syngas project to get over the next two or three years?",neg,train
"For fiscal year 2019, we expect a similar net impact as the full year effect of the lower U",neg,train
rate is approximately offset by the repeal of the U,neg,train
"production activities deduction, and credits for foreign taxes and other changes that takes effect in 2019",neg,train
So I would use about a 20% to 21% book effective tax rate to model Air Products going forward,neg,train
"So I think, first of all, I’d maybe take those in reverse order, cause I think the key point there is, there's just broad based industrial momentum in probably the world today",neg,train
"But China being to certain degree a workshop for the world, there's broad space demand growth there",neg,train
"Obviously, the coastal area is a little bit stronger than inland",neg,train
It'll be interesting to see how quickly the volumes rebound from that,neg,test
A great example of a customer becoming more comfortable with the outsourcing sale of gas model,neg,train
And you haven't commented on where your capacity utilization rates are for LOX/LINin China,neg,train
"But I know one of your competitors mentioned that they're running over 90%, which is the point at which we might get concerned or expect to see from capacity additions",neg,train
Are there any expectations on your part to debottleneck or otherwise add merger capacity in China over the next year or so?,neg,train
We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley,neg,test
"Overall, the new tax act reduced our tax rate in Q1 by about 260 basis points, which increased EPS by about $0",neg,train
"As you can see, the positive impact of the lower U",neg,test
"tax rate was partially offset by other tax act changes, including reduced benefits from the U",neg,train
"For the full year 2018, we expect the new tax act to reduce our tax rate by about 250 basis points to 300 basis points to somewhere in the range of about 20% to 21%",neg,train
"We cannot disclose the exact amount of the capital, David, but it is not a $1 billion project",neg,train
"And Kevin, it was very simply the fact that the new owners of the steel -- the way they do their financials and all of that, they decided that their cost of capital is on all of that that they rather own the plant rather than us supplying it",neg,test
And we always are obviously do what the customer wants to do,neg,train
And the transaction financially was also very effective for us,neg,train
And so they have put that money to work at a higher return,neg,train
We will take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays,neg,train
"Well no, that’s not the correct way of looking at that",neg,train
But I think we can go through that detail offline with -- Simon can give you a lot more detail on that,neg,train
"For our next question, we will go to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse",neg,train
"Coming out of that, I would expect the overall supply demand dynamics to remain very positive for the industry",neg,train
We had last year the shutting down of the induction furnaces,neg,train
"All in all, I think it's going to remain a positive dynamic for us",neg,train
"Beginning this quarter, we adopted the new pension accounting standard",neg,train
"Adopting this accounting standard is required for all companies, we chose to adopt earlier than many",neg,train
"This new accounting standard does not impact pension or overall cost, or earnings per share but it does move the impact of non-service related pension costs to other non-operating income and expense",neg,train
"The volume strength was broad based, covering a wide range of end markets",neg,train
Pricing was also positive across the regions with Asia and particularly China posting the biggest gain,neg,train
On cost we had -- lots of things that happened last year,neg,train
"Good news items that didn’t repeat, as well as in this quarter we had some higher planned maintenance",neg,train
So those would be the key items that are driving the cost year-on-year,neg,train
I will also point out that in the price raw materials is there any changing in power and input cost are netted in there,neg,train
So that is price net of those input costs and still recovered $0,neg,train
"08 above, which is separate from the cost item down below",neg,train
"Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning",neg,train
"In terms of the underlying improvement and the Asia margin performance this quarter, as I exclude the impact of the plant sales",neg,train
"Is that really just the impact of the pricing improvement there? Can you maybe talk about other dynamics that are at work there, helping your margin and how sustainable that is, going forward?",neg,train
This is what we call asset buybacks and we see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category,neg,train
"Now please go to slide number 11, which shows you the results of our three key metrics for the quarter and the year",neg,train
"Finally, please turn to slide number 12, which continues to be my favorite side",neg,train
It is great to see sustainable margins in the mid 30% range and it reminds us how far we have come in only a few years,neg,train
"David, as you know, we don't want to be commenting on pricing for the future",neg,train
"But the pricing of what has happened in the past, we can comment on that and that has been positive, and I'd like Corning to expand on that",neg,train
"But as far as future pricing, because of the nature of our industry, we don't want to comment on that",neg,train
"And then as a follow up, if I may, for Seifi",neg,train
What motivated your steel customer to want to purchase the plant from you? And I think you mentioned that you were pleased with the development,neg,train
"So to wrap up, ’17 results strong, 2018 is off to a very solid start",neg,train
"Just in looking at our development and redevelopment pipeline, first of all, all of our development activities are clearly laid out on pages 13 through 15 of our supp",neg,train
Our overall development pipeline is currently 77% pre-leased and our projected remaining spend is about $168 million,neg,train
"We did proceed on two smaller renovation projects, 500 North Gulph Road and 426 Lancaster Avenue with an anticipated aggregate investment base of $39 million and targeted return levels of 9",neg,train
"So I guess as we look at it, we've sold an awful lot of properties, almost $2",neg,train
We do believe we have about $400 million of non-core properties left,neg,train
"I think more thematically, as we look at the events in the last call the quarter or so, including the sale of evo, we look at that even with this sale of evo, which I’ll talk about in a second, we're still generating what we think is a top quarter pile FFO growth in the office sector",neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Rob Simone from Evercore ISI,neg,train
I would like to turn the call back over to Jerry Sweeney for closing remarks,neg,train
So I think we maintain a very good relationship with the number at the co-working companies,neg,train
And I think the next step for us is really thinking through how we can piggyback some of their ideas to meet a temporary niche that we see in some of your corporate level tax,neg,test
And I think we would expect the nextgen progress on that during 2018,neg,train
"On the investment front, you may recall our original disposition target was $100 million at a forecasted 8% cap rate",neg,train
"We finished the year with $430 million of sales, not including the reselling of evo transaction, our average cap rate was about 6% on a GAAP and cash basis",neg,train
The major contributors to our fourth quarter investment activity are included on page 3 of our supplemental package,neg,train
"I actually was going to ask that same exact question that Rich just asked, you gave a good answer to it, but maybe I could take it one step further, which is another thing about Brandywine is it's common for you to have assets for sale, but you're very particular about getting your price and you're not afraid to take it off the market",neg,train
"I was wondering if you could share how much you have on the market now and then it sounds like from your comments, if you've got 400 million of non-core, do you think it's not out of line for us to be kind of assuming that you sell roughly 400 million over the next couple of years, kind of opportunistically",neg,train
"The only financing activity we have on our plan is the recasting of our $250 million term loan, which we anticipate doing during the first half of the year",neg,train
"With the evo sale and the ATM issuance, we’re now projecting achieving our 6",neg,train
"0 times EBITDA target by 2018 and strong cash flow, even with our 12",neg,train
5% dividend increase we anticipate maintaining a solid CAD payout ratio of 68% at the midpoint,neg,train
"Tom, jumping back to the ATM rates for a second",neg,train
"Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2018  9:00 AM ET",neg,train
We've proactively built a number of spec suites to capture tenants seeking quick occupancy,neg,train
Boston’s economy is as robust as it’s experienced in nearly two decades with regional unemployment at 2,neg,train
We're 70% done on their leasing plan with both mark-to-market and same-store NOI growth continuing to demonstrate high growth characteristics,neg,train
[indiscernible] So we’re trying to evaluate all the different options,neg,train
"And then just lastly, we've hit on dispositions here a bit, but and I don’t know we talked about last quarter, but just a decision not to include any incremental at this point and it’s kind of the fatigue with you guys",neg,train
"Given guidance and a quarter or later, lowering guidance again, just -- the decision not to look at what you have in the market, what you really think you're going to sell this year and put that into guidance and if you have to, at the end of the year, raise guidance because you didn't hit the disposition target, kind of the decision to not go that way rather than kind of we’re seeing",neg,test
"I think on the overall development cost, we’re looking at $560 a square foot",neg,train
"I don’t have the breakdown in front of me, John, so we can follow up with the breakdown between the retail and the office and the residential, so I apologize for that",neg,train
"And we think we're building into a stronger market with the delivery of the Boston mall, but far city is doing",neg,train
"John, I’ll take the -- I mean, look, first of all, on Amazon, it’s obviously a big topic nationally and I think from our perspective, first of all, congratulations to the cities that made the shortlist",neg,train
We're really delighted that Philadelphia was on that list and followed up with Austin and DC being on that list as well,neg,train
Our role in that really honestly John is to stand at the ready to assist the city in any way we can to facilitate their bid,neg,train
"We're very enthusiastic about that, who knows where that process goes",neg,train
"At this point, George will provide an overview of operating performance, including some color on our ‘18 business plan and then turn it over to Tom for a review of our financial performance",neg,train
"Looking at the capital plan, we project CAD will be up 11% from the midpoint of our range",neg,train
The coverage is very similar to our 2017 coverage based on the CAD growth and our dividend increase,neg,train
"It's comprised of 160 of development or redevelopment, $130 million of common dividends, 38 million of revenue maintained and 35 million of revenue create and 7 million of mortgage amortization",neg,train
"And if I can ask just one more, I'm going to put the cart way before the horse here and ask when Amazon picks a market, well first, I don't know, I guess they probably pick a location within a market",neg,train
"Do you have any sense on how you kind of negotiate the terms of a rent and terms like that? Do you think that there's any expectation that Amazon or the government would expect you to make concessions, if for example, they pick Schuylkill Yards",neg,train
I'm just curious how the process would work once we get past this initial part,neg,train
"There will be another 400,000 square feet of retail, new restaurants, et cetera",neg,train
We continue to be pleased with the pace of activity in all of our markets,neg,train
"As Jerry detailed in his commentary, market activity and our team's ability to source, negotiate and close deals allowed us to beat a number of our 2017 goals",neg,train
These same characteristics have us off to a great start to 2018 with 75% of the plan achieved,neg,test
"6 million square feet with over 300,000 square feet in advanced stages of negotiation",neg,train
"George, maybe if you could, I know you guys have another piece left with Comcast",neg,train
"Just any update there potentially on what they're planning to do and just remind me, was any of the Comcast expansion related to the activity you're seeing for the Verizon backfills?",neg,train
"From an NAD perspective, this issuance did not dilute net asset value with consensus NAV of $18 at the high end of the NAV range, that resulted in $0",neg,train
"Turning to the Pennsylvania suburbs, our fourth quarter activity in Radnor has increased our leasing percentage to 92",neg,train
"We have assumed 90,000 square feet of currently vacant space to be reabsorbed in the latter half of the year",neg,test
We've been selected demo in several of the spaces and completed several common area improvements during the fourth quarter to aid in our leasing efforts,neg,train
"The pipeline in Radnor consists of approximately 235,000 square feet, including seven prospects over 20,000 square feet",neg,test
I think that's a good assumption as you look out over the next couple of years and I think we’ve really done a great job of getting the portfolio back to where we wanted to be,neg,train
"These non-core assets were still working through some of the value creation that we think we can harvest from them, which is why we developed our plan we didn’t really lay out a target number",neg,train
"But right now, we really do not have a lot of the market",neg,train
"We always respond to reverse inquiries, which we’re seeing somewhere -- which we always get in from all three of the markets that we're in",neg,train
"So just a big picture question for you Jerry, I guess this is a recurring theme from Brandywine in terms of dispositions bringing down their earnings growth profile",neg,train
"As we wrote in our note last night, we understand them to be very good real estate decisions, value creation and all the rest",neg,train
"But I'm curious where you're at on that process because we sense I guess a sense of frustration from investors that are waiting on growth going up as opposed to down and maybe the disposition process is nearing an end, so that we won't have these things to explain in future periods",neg,train
I mean just wondering how you balance the idea of good real estate decisions with the fact that you're a publicly traded REIT that where growth at the same -- growth at the quarterly basis matters to people?,neg,train
"At Cira Center, two full contiguous floors totaling 55,000 square feet roll on June 30",neg,train
Our 2018 plan still assumes these floors remain vacant for the duration of the year,neg,train
We've had several tours to date and have one proposal outstanding for half of the space,neg,train
"I would like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Jerry Sweeney, President and CEO",neg,train
And then I guess just your views on co-working and how you think it’s going to have a -- make a difference going forward in your markets and how you guys are reacting for the trend?,neg,train
"I think from our perspective, we're coming up really heavily weighted disposition goal in 2017",neg,train
"Michael, it's a good question and I don't have any real visibility",neg,train
"I mean honestly, our role has been in a support one to the public policy makers, both the city and the state level where we are to kind of help them develop kind of the real estate fundamentals to present the best platform for them to in turn present that Amazon",neg,train

"We did look at our landscape for 2018, but either with these sales, we were still posting pretty good growth metrics",neg,train
Do you see meaningful growth through those types of tenants over the next year or so in your markets and in your portfolio?,neg,train
"Interest expense will decrease to $20 million, reflecting the fourth quarter effective bond transactions in ’17 and capitalized interests will be 500,000",neg,train
"Termination and other income will be 500,000 and 600,000 respectively",neg,train
5 million and we have no incremental ATM activity in our plan,neg,train
"In addition, we met our cash and GAAP same-store targets, the lower end on GAAP and the higher end on cash",neg,train
"We did come up 70 basis points short on our same-store leasing target for the year, primarily driven by the timing of leased executions by definitive prospects that have been or will be signed in Q1, 2018",neg,train
We also continued on our path to grow net effective rents with 2017 having a 7% increase over a net effective rent average of 2016,neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets,neg,train
"Our current business plan does not incorporate any acquisitions, nor any dispositions beyond our evo sale",neg,train
"We are continuing to project one development start during the year with the dollar value ranging between $50 million to $100 million and as we’ve emphasized, we don't really plan on starting any new development without a significant pre-lease and a strong pipeline of follow-on deals",neg,train
"Prior to beginning, certain information discussed during our call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law",neg,train
"Although we believe estimates reflected in these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot give assurance that the anticipated results will be achieved",neg,train
"For further information on factors that could impact our anticipated results, please reference our press release as well as our most recent annual and quarterly reports that we file with the SEC",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Eva was a process that we had a very solid bar that both Harrison Street and Brandywine set for and access,neg,train
We frankly weren’t quite sure we would get to that level,neg,test
We wound up having a very well orchestrated process that had a lot of different point of communications and we were able to identify a buyer who has the quality of being able to deliver efficiently on a transaction that size and had a really good long-term perspective which fit in well with what we’re trying to do here in cities,neg,train
So we weren't really sure that transaction would come across the table we did our last earnings call,neg,train
Now that you guys have dealt with at least part of the Comcast lease and you talked about the move outs at the end of June,neg,train
"Well, thank you all for participating in our fourth quarter call",neg,train
We look forward to updating you on our activities on our first quarter call later in the Spring,neg,train
"And then as we look into 2019, our largest exposure is with Comcast at Two Logan and we continue to kind of just wait and evaluate what their ongoing needs are going to be",neg,train
"And then three others all kind of over 50,000 square feet, we’re in active negotiations with already and think that we’ll end up retaining or hope to retain each of those",neg,test
"So again, ’18, ’19 and even 2020 expirations are all kind of on the table with our leasing teams every day to try and further mitigate our rollover exposure",neg,train
"We also started construction of our 165,000 square foot building at Four Points in Austin, Texas",neg,train
That project 100% leased to an existing tenant under a 10-year lease with estimate cost of $4 million to $8 million,neg,test
"We anticipate delivering that in Q1, 19 at an 8",neg,train
"We also construction on our 4040 Wilson project at 50% mixed use development, 50% joint venture ownership interest",neg,train
"There is a mixed use development in the Boston submarket that will contain 189,000 square feet of office, 36,000 of retail and 250 apartment units",neg,train
"I was hoping you guys can just talk through your thoughts on future development projects like if we look at the land inventory on page 16, if you could handicap what next starts might be or maybe just talk to kind of the level of interest in build to suites for some of those projects?",neg,train
That project is 100% leased on an 18-year lease at a 9,neg,test
"Amazon HQ2, I really always hate to ask this, but what are the primary locations for both Philadelphia and Austin? And then second, 4040 Wilson, how much, Jerry or whoever, is the development per square foot for the office and retail and the development per unit cost for the residential",neg,test
"Look, I think it’s a very viable delivery platform that addresses the needs of a number of tenants",neg,train
I think it’s – we’ll be interested to see how co-working evolves from kind of the small smart entrepreneurial model to really serving as temporary office space for large corporate users,neg,train
We track that -- we have some of the co-working spaces in our existing inventory,neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citi,neg,train
"Craig, 100% of the interest in the property was conveyed",neg,train
We're designing an incredibly high quality building that is something unlike anything that Philadelphia suburbs has seen before,neg,train
"So it’s a site core configuration, very efficient for [indiscernible]",neg,train
"We only have four leases in the balance of 2018 over 20,000 square feet",neg,train
"I mentioned in my prepared remarks the 55,000 square feet at Cira",neg,train
"The other two tenants there over 20,000 square feet are both projected to renew and we're in negotiations with them right now",neg,test
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Brandywine Realty Trust Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded",neg,train
"During the quarter, we generated 92 space inspections, totaling 547,000 square feet, outpacing the third quarter in both measures",neg,train
Our CBD portfolio rollover exposure is now below 9% each year through 2021,neg,train
"As discussed on our last call, a 100,000 square foot tenant vacated 5 contiguous floors at Three Logan on January 1",neg,train
"Since our last call, we've executed leases on two of these floors and are under LOIs for two additional floors",neg,train
The floor deals were done at an average cash mark-to-market of 10%,neg,train
"So with that, we’d be delighted to open up the floor for questions",neg,train
I think the primary though process that we had on this ATM issuance was to really make sure we were in great shape from meeting our balance sheet targets,neg,train
"The office and retail component is currently 46% pre-leased, leaving us with a little over 100,000 square feet of lease over the next two years",neg,test
"We anticipate substantial completion in Q1, ’20 with an office stabilization in Q3, ’21",neg,train
We continued construction on our Subaru of America project at our Knights Crossing Campus,neg,train
"And then lastly real quick, will you be in Minneapolis next weekend?",neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"02 per share dilutive to 2018 FFO, but at the midpoint of our guidance, we are still posting a 4",neg,train
"5% FFO growth rate and 11% CAD growth rate with a constant dividend coverage of 68%, even after the dividend increase",neg,train
"We ended the year with a net cash balance of $202 million, zero balance on our line of credit with minimal floating rate exposure through the company",neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference",neg,train
"03 per share of one-time related costs, early debt extinguishment of debt, comprised of 3",neg,train
"9 million from the early redemption of our 2018 bonds, 800,000 of net interest expense due to having the bonds outstanding for the make-whole period and 1",neg,train
3 million on our share of costs related to the prepayment bit the of mortgage is related to Austin joint venture,neg,train
"Due to timing, the issuance of shares through our continuous equity program generated an incremental 510 weighted average shares during the quarter",neg,train
Our fourth quarter fixed charge and interest coverage ratios were 3,neg,train
4 respectively and common shares issued in the fourth quarter sales activity reduced our net debt to ea to 6,neg,train
"Some observations regarding the fourth quarter results, same-store rates for the fourth quarter were negative 2",neg,train
"We've had 20 positive quarters of cash metric, while we have negative quarterly same store growth, we achieved positive for the full year 2017",neg,train
"With these additional four properties in the mix, our second half of the year same-store NOI will range between 10% and 13% on a cash basis and 4% to 5% on a GAAP basis",neg,train
"So on the Three Logan piece, the expansion occurred outside of the Verizon floors",neg,train
"We did take one tenant who was in a Comcast expansion floor and moved them down to the Verizon, but the rest of that leasing activity in the Verizon space has come from other parts of the city",neg,train
"The Two Logan piece, again as I said, I think it's a little bit of a wait and see",neg,train
So they need to kind of staff that up and then we'll kind of see what the next bite at the apple was,neg,train
And so certainly having increased financial capacity is very much at the top of our thoughts,neg,train
The primary sources will be 215 million of cash flow from operations after interest,neg,train
43 million from evo proceeds and a 112 million of use of cash on hand,neg,train
"Based on the capital plan outlined, our projected cash balance will be approximately 90 million at the end of the year",neg,train
"Based on equity issuance and the evo sale, we now project our net debt to EBITDA ratio will be at six times by the end of the year and our debt to GAV will remain in the high 30% area",neg,test
"In addition, we anticipate our fixed charge ratio improving to 3",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Guinee from Stifel,neg,train
"I think we’ll see continued expansion, Jamie, [indiscernible] meaningful growth, but I think there is about half a million square feet of that in the overall Philadelphia market",neg,test
"Looking at first quarter of ’18, the following are just some of our general assumptions",neg,train
"FMC, office and residential operations will generate an incremental $2 million of GAAP NOI",neg,train
"One Drexel, 3000 Market in Four Tower Bridge was generating an incremental 500,000",neg,train
"On the balance sheet, we made great progress during 2017",neg,train
Net debt to ea closed out the year at 6,neg,train
"We accessed the public debt markets, raised $550 million at an average yield of 3",neg,train
"9%, used those proceeds to pay off $325 million of 4",neg,train
We reduced our average cost of debt by 45 basis points,neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lewis from SunTrust,neg,train
"It’s really a manageable thing, a strong investment market there",neg,train
"And then down in DC, we were able to get the 4040 Wilson transaction moving forward and we're just in the premarketing mode for the balance of our office inventory down there",neg,train
"In Northern Virginia, we're currently 91% leased and with Northrop Grumman’s renewal in Dulles Corner behind us, our annual rollover in metro DC is also below 9% for each year through 2021",neg,train
"The pipeline of new deals is 270,000 square feet and we have approximately 100,000 square feet of new leasing in our open 2018 business plan",neg,train
FFO contribution from our unconsolidated joint ventures would total $6 million and reflects this joint venture sale of evo,neg,train
"G&A, consistent with prior years, our first quarter G&A will be high at $9 million and our -- but our annual G&A for the year will be $28 million",neg,test
"I think as Jerry mentioned, we did want to get to the bottom end of that range and hit the six",neg,train
So those were two items and then we have a couple of other opportunities for development also,neg,train
"So I think it was -- we had some dry powder, we’ll have cash at the end of the year as I mentioned of close to $90 million",neg,train
"I think as I mentioned on the last call, it's fascinating from a real estate standpoint to see what a disruptive influence the process Amazon has used for site selection and had on our business and I think it's going to generate a lot of positive long-term value for our industry",neg,train
"And then Jerry, on evo, it was unclear from the press release, did Harrison Street show there interest as well?",neg,train
"We already have 75% of our revenue plan done, with a strong pipeline of pending lease activity",neg,train
We believe our operating plan is on solid footing with the bias to the outside,neg,train
Our 2018 business plan objectives are clearly laid out on page three of our supplemental package and we also compare our 2018 targets to our full year business plan targets on page 6,neg,train
"So bottom line, 2018 represents a continuation of strong operating results with occupancy and leasing levels improving, positive mark-to-market, positive cash same-store growth and capital costs remaining within our targeted range",neg,train
"As indicated in our press release, we have updated our previously issued 2018 guidance range, which was previously $1",neg,train
The revision to our midpoint is driven solely by $0,neg,train
01 per share dilution caused by the evo sale and the $0,neg,train
"Now, looking at this year, our 2018 plan is off to a great start",neg,train
"We’ll start with a review of our 2017 results and then move into our 2018 business plan and I’m really just going to touch on ’17 results, as our disclosures lay out a clear roadmap that demonstrate our very solid ending to 2017",neg,train
"From an operational standpoint, we exceeded the vast majority of our goals, namely tenant retention, cash mark-to-market leasing capital cost, average lease -- and our average lease term",neg,train
"As part of our Schuylkill Yards development, we did close on the acquisition of One Drexel Plaza, a 283,000 square foot office property for $35 million that we plan to reposition over the next 12 to 18 months",neg,train
"Based upon our preliminary budget of $83 million, which includes the acquisition price, we anticipate a targeted return of 9%",neg,train
"We have also executed a lease with a life science company for 108,000 square feet, we will begin staging in their occupancy in late second quarter 2018",neg,train
"So for example, on the sale of evo, that was a wonderful opportunity to sell with a non-core asset in a really core location for us",neg,train
We had a great partner with Harrison Street there who knows this market segment very well,neg,train

"As a result of several large moveouts occurring in the second half of 2017, coupled with the Three Logan’s vacate this month, our first and second quarter same-store growth metric will be below our annual range",neg,train
The same-store portfolio will return to growth levels ranging between 3% and 5% on a GAAP basis and 2% to 4% on a cash basis in the fourth quarter as these spaces are reabsorbed,neg,train
"That market is doing incredibly well, Rents have continue to migrate north on both the notional and effective basis",neg,train
"So that is 200,000 square foot building with parking underneath it",neg,train
So it’s not a large building in terms of square footage,neg,train
"Glenda, thank you and good morning, everyone and thank you all for participating in our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call",neg,train
"On today’s call, with me today are George Johnstone, our Executive Vice President of Operations; Tom Wirth, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Dan Palazzo, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer",neg,train
And then you mentioned the tough decision to issue the shares,neg,train
Did you provide an outlook for - what you are expecting for accretion moving forward?,neg,test
"On the expense side, the increase in operating expense quarter-over-quarter was tied to the Commerce acquisition",neg,train
"We anticipate a mid single digit increase in core operating expenses in the first quarter primarily reflecting seasonal employee benefit cost, a full quarter of Commerce expenses and an increase in FDIC charges tied to crossing the $10 billion mark",neg,train
The expense impacts tied to tax reform from the minimum wage hike and employee development is expected to be about $4 million for the year,neg,test
"The non-core charges in the fourth quarter included $16 million in Commerce acquisition cost, $3 million in one-time employee and community investment and $18 million tied to the DTA write down as a result of tax reform",neg,train
And importantly improved our loan to deposit ratio to 95%,neg,train
"With the teams we've added in the market, we are already seeing the business opportunities and we anticipate achieving the projected cost savings and earnings accretion on schedule",neg,train
"We are in the process of opening the doors to our Boston Headquarter, officially making us the largest regional bank with corporate headquarters in Boston",neg,test
"Our new regional, commercial and private banking leaders are locating there",neg,train
And so we anticipate selectively building our team in the city over the course of the year,neg,train
And this included the benefits of the First Choice and Commerce acquisitions along with solid organic growth,neg,train
"I am pinch hitting for Ali O'Rourke today, but not to worry, Ali will be back to lead off for our next call",neg,train
So thanks for joining us for this discussion of year end results,neg,train
Our news release is available on the Investor Relations sections of our website berkshirebank,neg,train
Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from these statements,neg,train
"For detail on related factors, please see our earnings release and most recent SEC reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q",neg,train
With that I am going to open it up to any questions,neg,train
"With that, I'll turn the call over to CEO, Mike Daly",neg,train
So that pipeline is moving north of about $200 million,neg,train
"And then just in terms deposit pricing across your market and any sort of - you talked about loan yields, any sort of variation on the deposit cost side across your core market there, just what you are seeing, is there been any sort of outside movement, one geographic region over the other",neg,train
And then just the mix that you are seeing so when you guys - you are thinking about mid to high single digit loan growth for the year,neg,train
Do you anticipate much variation from the current composition of the portfolio?,neg,train
I mean if you it's - that's one of those things right,neg,train
It's going to be depended on what happens out there in the market,neg,train
"And that's going to be one of the things that drives you the NIM up or down, right",neg,train
That's just something we are going to have deal with when it happens,neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to Gordon Prescott, Senior Vice President, General Counsel",neg,train
"For the first quarter, we expect the margin to decline slightly due to lower purchase loan accretion and the new tax rate impact on FTE",neg,train
Purchase loan accretion is expected to gradually come back down and be in the $4,neg,train
"We don't expect any significant changes to our overall credit or charge-off levels in the first quarter, and we anticipate our provision will be slightly lower next quarter",neg,train
"58 in core EPS in the fourth quarter, a 4% increase year-over-year including the impact of the share issuances",neg,train
06 which includes one-time charges related to writing down the DTA due to tax reform and the close of the Commerce acquisition,neg,test
"Overall, fee income was mostly flat quarter-over-quarter as the increased deposit fees from Commerce offset seasonally lower mortgage and SBA fees",neg,train
We originated $660 million in held for sale mortgages with new production coming on about 65% purchase,neg,train
"In the first quarter, we expect fee income to be stable as seasonally lower loan fee revenue is offset by seasonally higher wealth management and insurance revenues",neg,train
"I was curious if you could walk us through maybe as we talked about the NIM side but on the expense outlook in term of first quarter, I know there is a lot noise in the fourth quarter and probably some in the first quarter but stripping out the merger charges you talk about maybe what you are thinking in terms of - what's a good quarter run rate looking into the first quarter for operating expenses?",neg,train
So we said mid single digit in Q1 update in terms of expenses,neg,train
That's a little bit high for the whole year because we have some seasonal payroll factors and things like that that happen in Q1,neg,train
And again we guided to an EPS growth of 17% to 20% and efficiency ratio below 60%,neg,train
"And combined with the lower tax rate, we are targeting core EPS growth in the 17% to 20% range for 2018, with our core ROA above 1% and our efficiency ratio below 60% for the full year",neg,train
We are pleased with our performance over the last year and optimistic about our continued growth,neg,train
The Board is to raise the dividend by another 5% this year evidencing their confidence heading into 2018,neg,train
Tax reform should have a positive impact on the region and growth in the economy looks poised to continue,neg,train

"(NASDAQ:BHLB) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
"Good morning, and welcome to the Berkshire Hills Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call",neg,train
"And then just on - I just want to make sure we are talking like apples-to-apples so on the NIM, your sort of accretion assumption for 2018 when you talk about your NIM outlook",neg,train
I know you mentioned first quarter but just yes little bit more broadly,neg,train
"And we don't run any non-relationship special so the demand deposit really helps us minimize upward rate pressure, but we've seen disciplined and stability",neg,train
"And with our recent commercial and private banking hires in Boston, we are in a strong position to capitalize on those opportunities",neg,train
It's a strong culture and it's the right people that have allowed us to come this far,neg,train
This momentum should produce strong results over the next several years and that will benefit all our constituents,neg,test
We integrated the First Choice deal; we crossed the $10 billion in asset threshold with the Commerce deal,neg,train
That allowed us to absorb the cost and keep profitability trends positive,neg,train
We managed our expenses and we drove solid organic growth across the footprint,neg,train
"We are pleased with the high level of talent, their attention to customer service and their enthusiasm for continued growth in the region",neg,train
And the full system integration will be completed near the end March and we look forward to capitalizing on the benefits of our partnership throughout the year,neg,train
"We estimate about $12 million in remaining Commerce acquisition cost at this point, most of that should flow through in the first quarter",neg,train
Our core tax rate in fourth quarter was 32% which includes the benefit of some historic credits,neg,train
"Going forward, historic tax credits will have significantly less impact for us due both to our growth and tax reform legislation",neg,train
We anticipate our core tax rate will be in the 22% to 24% range for the full year and at the high end of that range in the first quarter,neg,train
"All together, we expect core earnings per share in the first quarter to be 10% to 12% higher than the fourth quarter and we estimate that the diluted common share account will average about 46",neg,train
And then speaking on the concept of Boston I was hoping you could update us in your presence there,neg,train
"We also took the opportunity to contribute an additional $2 million to the bank's foundation which supports charitable organizations, scholarships and volunteers from across Berkshire's local community",neg,train
"In addition to donations, we, of course, encourage all of our employees to volunteer in their local communities and actually provide pay time off for them to do that",neg,train
Because giving back is another of core values our cultures build at,neg,train
"Starting with the balance sheet, we grew loans organically 6% annualized in the fourth quarter which includes 5% annualized organic commercial growth",neg,train
The pipeline remain healthy and we expect to see mid single digit annualized commercial growth in the first quarter and mid to high single digit annualized total loan growth,neg,test
"Now on the deposit side, we ended the year with strong organic growth",neg,train
"In the first quarter, we anticipate low single digit annualized growth and average balances",neg,train
Period-end balances will continue to depend on daily activity in commercial payroll balances,neg,test
Company delivered 21% C&I growth and 8% total organic commercial loan growth for the year,neg,train
Margins expanded and fee income increased to close to 30% in net revenue,neg,train
Core return on assets improved significantly and we kept our efficiency ratio below 60% despite the impact of the mortgage business,neg,train
We also bolstered our capital during the year ending the fourth quarter with the tangible equity to asset ratio of 8,neg,train
Now we start 2018 with the benefit of tax reform,neg,train
"And Jamie will comment on the fourth quarter accounting impact and on the expected for 2018, but the reform is generally positive for corporate taxes",neg,train
"As you know, we felt strongly about passing a portion of the benefit on to our employees and communities",neg,train
"We announced earlier this month an increase in our minimum wage to $15 an hour and this impact along with further adjustments to our pay scale, benefited over 25% of our employees and quite frankly we believe this was the right thing to do",neg,train
The first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
"And this would also mean a core ROA over 1%, so good start to the year",neg,train
I'd also like to touch on some high level 2018 guidance,neg,train
We expect to grow loans at a mid to high single digit pace this year with deposit growth to match,neg,train
Our new teams and expanded markets including Greater Boston and New Jersey should contribute to this growth,neg,train
Our margins are expected to be steady barring any significant change in deposit betas,neg,train
Credit shows no sign of deteriorating and we anticipate that it will remain stable throughout the year,neg,train
"And lastly, the mortgage business should remain healthy but we are not forecasting any significant growth in 2018",neg,train
We really like the Northern New Jersey and the Greater Philadelphia market,neg,train
It's proving to be a good ABL hub for us,neg,train
We are pleased with the overall performance and look forward to delivering solid results in 2018,neg,train
So we expect the provision to be slightly lower in Q1 and then it will depend on loan growth after that,neg,train
So that's kind of how we are looking at them,neg,train
We've got a lot experience on boarding and modeling as it pertains to acquisition,neg,train
And everything we've seen so far is right where we would expect,neg,train
"We provided one time bonuses to over a 1,000 of our employees as a thank you for their hard work and dedication",neg,train
We've also earmarked a portion of the tax benefit to build out and enhance our employee development and training programs,neg,train
"As many of you know, culture has always been important to us and that our employees are really the soul of our efforts",neg,train
And this means supporting and encouraging and rewarding our front line because we believe motivated employees deliver satisfied customers communities and of course shareholders,neg,train
"So that's more of a macro issue than anything specific with First Choice or just how that's integrating - the opportunity you maybe thought is not materializing, okay",neg,train
And then lastly would you mind sharing with us your commercial loan pipeline and how that compares to last quarter?,neg,train
"Now at this point I'm going to turn it over to Jamie, he will provide you review of the quarter and then I'll wrap it up",neg,train
"Yes, Collyn, I think if you go over to look at the like the overall landscape I think most companies are sort of predicting a lower origination of mortgages in 2018 versus 2017",neg,train
So you should think about that as gradually coming down over the course of the year,neg,train
Of course it's hard to know exactly when that happens,neg,train
"Last quarter, we had a surprise when a loan prepays",neg,train
"There has accretion tied to it, it can make things a little bumpy",neg,test
"But I think if you sort of look at 2017's number, you can expect something like that for 2018 as well",neg,train
We are seeing a mid to high 4s as a roll on rate right now,neg,train
Average earning assets grew 14% this quarter including the impact of the Commerce acquisition,neg,train
"Margins have continued to hold up well, driven by the rate hikes and low deposit betas",neg,test
Our NIM in the fourth quarter advanced to 350 and purchase loan accretion grew to $5,neg,train
Loans approaching and heading towards $3 billion for the Greater Boston market,neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
We see it as healthy and we really look at the business to really drive 30 to 35 bps of pretax profit,neg,test
"When we are seeing margins stable as we see them now, we look to hold the business",neg,train
"And then for you Jamie, on the NIM, just curious what's going into your assumptions there like in terms of deposit pricing pressure and then rate, what - your rate outlook?",neg,train
So the accretion number we gave for Q1 is $4,neg,train
And then again we expect that to gradually come down throughout the rest of the year,neg,train
The next question comes from Brody Preston of Piper Jaffray,neg,train
So fully in 2Q from the Commerce side of the house in terms of cost savings,neg,train
"And then with the Commerce transaction, how are you guys doing on customer retention on both the deposits and the loan side?",neg,train
"If I heard you correctly and Mike your comment at the end on mortgage, you suggesting that it was healthy but not seeing significant growth",neg,train
What - can you talk a little bit about your outlook there and why not more growth?,neg,train
That's not to say that we won't see an increase in mortgage business,neg,train
I think we just - I think from our standpoint we are forecasting our budget next year on that significant growth in that area,neg,train
"With me this morning are Richard Marotta, Sean Gray and Jamie Moses",neg,train
"I'll provide an overview of the quarter and the year and then I'll turn it over to Jamie who will walk you through some of the financials, we'll discuss our outlook and guidance and then I'll wrap it up",neg,train
I'd like to turn the conference back over to Michael P Daly for any closing remarks,neg,train
"I should say they will be fully through in Q2 and then Q3, Q4 going to be - would be the run rate",neg,train
The next question comes from Dave Bishop of FIG Partners,neg,test
And I presume then you are just still expecting continued funding pressure right because of the - because you would get a benefit I would assume obviously on the asset side,neg,train
"Good, just wanted to start on some really nice organic trend on the C&I front this quarter and this year as you alluded to",neg,train
Are there particular market that are showing strength and are you seeing increasing optimism across your footprint?,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
We certainly look forward to speaking with everyone again in April when we discuss our first quarter results,neg,train
"So the way we are thinking about it, Collyn, is that we are going to have a smaller decline in Q1 maybe 3 to 5 basis points and that's going to be tied to the lower accretion number that we talked about in the script",neg,train
And then there is maybe a basis point or two there tied to the FTE adjustments going forward in 2018,neg,train
And then after that we expected to be pretty stable,neg,train
So we think the NIM is going to be stable,neg,train
"In addition, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call",neg,train
"References to non-GAAP measures are only provided to assist you in understanding Berkshire's results and performance trends, and should not be relied upon as financial measures of actual results or future projections",neg,train
A comparison and reconciliation to GAAP measures is included in our news release,neg,train
"No, because if we have that -- if we have that capability I would have been able to tell you on December 12 it doesn't all happen on the last day of the month",neg,train
But there's a sales business I know there is a rush at the end of the month in order get things booked,neg,train
But I think at this point I really don't have a look at January at this point,neg,train
"In addition, for reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures discussed on this call, as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website",neg,train
And when you think like the mid 4% range for 2018 what type of pricing environment are you guys assuming in there?,neg,train
"Third, we hope to have a special Investor Day in late March or first week of April to give you that reconciliation and the new GAAP numbers",neg,train
That should give you time to digest prior to us releasing our first quarter 2018 results which will be solely on the new GAAP basis,neg,train
"No, nothing special in the fourth quarter and looking forward, we're not seeing a lot of pressure right now obviously our Mexico affiliate got hit because of the earthquake that hurt us a little bit this quarter but that comes through a different line",neg,test
But I'm not [indiscernible] contingent or supplemental coming into the year at all,neg,train
There were some one-off items in the corporate item that we just don't see repeated again,neg,train
"I think especially if you throw in the move and the tax reform items and that the -- there were matters related to the litigation that we won three years ago, that we're running through there, there is some cost that won’t repeat",neg,train
"Our results now in 2017 will show about a over $50 million less cash taxes paid, so that's a good outcome",neg,train
"Some things that take on the rates, I think our outlook last year was done on a 20% rate and we're at 21% now",neg,train
"I think that there were deductions that we lost in tax reform, that we didn't anticipate in the 6 -- when we were looking at 2016 results, so you add all that up, and then the other -- the last thing is the shift in income we have, last year we had substantially more integration expense in our international operations that's not there now",neg,train
So as a result those were operating higher tax jurisdictions now that erode some of that differential between the years,neg,train
We don't -- we don't do well with people that don't have any interest in our capabilities and the resources that we bring,neg,train
"So I don't see it as impacting our results, the number of what that we'll have next year will be up and maybe for PE too, but I think there is plenty of them amount there",neg,train
And one last question is a number question is that if you look at your reported in a pro forma for the corporate segments and especially the corporate lines it you looks like under the new tax law looks like the losses will be double the prior so a tax regime,neg,train
So but if you look at a forecast for your net earnings or net losses in that line in 2018 is roughly the same as the 2017 I just wondering why is the losses not more in the corporate line,neg,train
I just want to make sure that our tax credit strategy was always there to take our rate from the regular rate today and T-rate so that goes -- used to go from 35% to 20%,neg,train
Now with the way while our work we will be able to take our rate from 21% to 5,neg,train
"So it's almost exactly the same 15% setbacks in the rate, so the amount that it produces for us is nearly identical",neg,test
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"If you add acquisitions, which is accretive to production headcount you got that number",neg,train
"Then the on the margin front I just wondering like you grow about 4% and if you look at the margin for the full-year actually it could expand even more, especially I'm looking at your comp expense ratio for the full-year roughly flat year-over-year",neg,train
So why wouldn't it have more sort of wage or like expense leverage,neg,train
Number one is that could you talk a bit more about your technology investment and how do you think sort of technology could disrupt the brokerage business,neg,train
Let's leave the earnings release and move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website,neg,train
"On Page 2, you will see that nearly all of the fourth quarter 2017 actuals came in very close to our estimates that we provided at our December 12 Investor Relations Day",neg,train
Also on both Pages 2 and 3 that we took a shot at some estimates for full-year 2018,neg,train
"However because of the new revenue recognition standard at this time, we are not comfortable providing 2018 quarterly estimate",neg,train
"And so can you remind me what the seasonality for the property renewals, is it pretty even does more stuff come up before the summer?",neg,train
"Our merger partners see our vast capabilities, believe in our unique culture, and realize that we could be more successful together",neg,train
I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals,neg,train
Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"It's highly complicated and but I think that you characterized it correctly I wasn't commenting on any one-time item other than the cumulative effect of the change that comes in, in January -- that will book basically 12/31/15 or January 1, 2016",neg,train
Next I'd like to move to our risk management segment which is primarily Gallagher Bassett,neg,train
The call we posted over 10% organic in the third quarter and accordingly we forecasted 2% to 3% organic in our December IR Day,neg,train
Stronger organic in the quarter was the primary driver of our adjusted EBITDAC margin of 17,neg,train
"And I know you have added in the last couple of years, you've invested in this practice added a fair amount to it, is that allowing to go up market a bit, I'm not talking about the Jumbo’s but are you getting some of our declines also?",neg,train
"Second and third quarter all right, those are the bigger quarters, right?",neg,train
"Well, I think if you take a look at the numbers around and InsurTech investments there is billions of dollars flowing into this industry",neg,train
We're doing I think a pretty good job of watching that,neg,train
But so far the things that we watched and followed some are very clever but I don't see them as being a drastic disruptor in particular where we stake out our position in the marketplace is as a trusted advisor,neg,train
Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo,neg,train
In terms of productivity and quality at Gallagher Bassett we have an outstanding differentiated value proposition that continues to be recognized as best-in-class,neg,train
"For example, in the 2017 advice and claims satisfaction survey, Gallagher Bassett was the highest regarded in casualty claims handling",neg,train
"Not only where we rated significantly higher than all the TPAs, we also ranked ahead of all carriers recognized in the survey",neg,train
"On Page 2, you will see that with the dollar weakening, FX could turn to a slight tailwind in 2018",neg,train
"In today's rate, it might feel EPS by a penny a quarter or so",neg,test
The M&A environment with tax rates going down is that pushing out multipliers are either in private equity or you all paying more for these after-tax dollars?,neg,train
If you look at InsurTech that's really improvement of service tech,neg,train
"So those are the places that have but when it comes to just pure distribution tech selling insurance in their way pretty hard when our customers are buying four, five different policies on the account",neg,train
"Because typically those are 1-type -- one single coverage type policies, and that's really not what we specialize in",neg,train
We're competing well on multithousand life cases now against some of the stronger competitors,neg,test
Good afternoon and welcome to Arthur J Gallagher & Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call,neg,train
Your lines will be open for questions following the presentation,neg,train
"If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time",neg,train
"In the Independent 2018 PRIMUS report issued by two industry veterans, our Luminos System was recognized as the TPA leader with the highest net promoter score and most comprehensive in system capabilities and solutions offered among all TPAs",neg,train
"These are just two accolades that highlight the continuous investments we're making in the very best people, processes, and technology that are necessary to increase productivity, while consistently delivering the highest quality and to marchably superior outcomes for our clients",neg,train
International property/casualty brokerage organic growth was 7% in the quarter,neg,train
"Australia and New Zealand were up around 9%, the UK was up 5%, and Canada was up 6%",neg,train
", Australia and New Zealand are experiencing the strong price increases in the mid-single-digit range",neg,test
Our UK retail and Canadian operations are seeing a more stable rate environment while London specialty operations are now seeing a bottoming as underwriters are asking for rate,neg,train
"So talking about tax reform, flip to Page 6 of the CFO commentary, we have again provided our best look at comparing our pro forma for 2017 as if tax reform happened January 1st of 2017",neg,train
We hope that is helpful in understanding the impact on EPS,neg,train
"First, you'll see that our core brokerage and risk management operations benefit substantially from tax reform, but our corporate cost don't benefit as much",neg,train
"That comp ratio is kind of being the comp ratio for us for 30 years, 40 years something like that",neg,train
"Number one, organic growth; number two, growing through mergers and acquisitions; number three, improving our productivity, quality, and margins; and fourth, maintaining our very unique Gallagher culture",neg,train
The team once again executed an all four of these this quarter and well what a great quarter and a fantastic year,neg,train
"And then one another question you guys are, the growth that you guys saw in the contingents and supplementals also looked pretty strong in the quarter was there some seasonality there and then what's the outlook I know it's included within your all-in number but for contingents and supplementals for 2018?",neg,train
So how did we do for the year in our brokerage segment? 9% total adjusted revenue growth of which 4,neg,train
"4% is organic, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 11%, adjusted EBITDAC margin 27",neg,test
"Let's go for the corporate segment if you look at what we expected and what we published on December 12, we hit exactly what we thought on interest expenses maybe a little bit better, so got better there",neg,train
"We blew the doors off, as Pat said, on clean energy",neg,train
"So we came at the higher end of the range on our earnings on that, and we also have less loss on the corporate line of corporate there and maybe we didn't really forecast any lease move related to our headquarters, so that came in right",neg,train
"So maybe you are looking at I don’t know what you are exactly looking at but we did book our tax reform adjustments which was about $29 million charge, as we adjusted our deferred tax assets as we adjusted our transition tax, and a few other items that we adjusted some actual to current differences there but returned to actual provision items there",neg,train
But by and large I think all of our numbers actually beat the expectations that we laid out in December,neg,train
When you said the organic in 2018 would need to be closer to 4% and 3% for margin expansion can just remind me why it would be a higher organic requirement next year or this year?,neg,test
Let me offer a few comments on the forthcoming accounting change related to revenue recognition,neg,train
"First, we're well and along in our implementation of the new standard",neg,train
A great example of our culture is when we celebrated our 90th anniversary this past October,neg,train
Just four months in and we are well on our way to exceeding that goal,neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train
IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT,neg,train
USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,test
Like Pat said a truly excellent fourth quarter and full-year 2017,neg,train
I think that -- I think this -- but remember the real motivation for somebody to join us is they want our capabilities and our resources and that is also accelerating even more rapidly,neg,train
So the money will be better for those folks that are selling,neg,train
"Today, I’ll highlight a couple of items behind the headline numbers in the earnings release",neg,train
"I'll then move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website to help you think about 2018 and tax reform, and then I will end with some comments on the forthcoming new revenue recognition standard",neg,train
"So my understanding you haven't done a lot of the big facilities, a lot of the big programs that some of the other -- some of your other competitors have is that in general is that on point?",neg,train
Probably I think that whenever we benefit from confusion and change,neg,train
"And when you got the reform stuff going on and Washington, changes to the ACA, our people need an awful lot of help of that",neg,train
There's about three things there let's go to the first one,neg,train
"First and foremost when we provided our commentary last year related to 2016 like I said, I think the most important number is the cash taxes that we pay globally",neg,train
"Last year I think by my memory is right, we would have said that we would have paid in 2016, we paid about $66 million of taxes and had tax reform happen at 2016",neg,train
"We would have paid about $40 million, so only about a $26 million improvement in cash",neg,train
So you will see that our range of earnings in 2018 is in the $105 million to $115 million range versus the $133 million we posted this year,neg,train
We still expect those investments to generate over $225 million of tax credits,neg,train
"So tax reform does not reduce the amount of tax credits we can generate, that's a really great outcome",neg,train
"So for the year in our risk management segment, 7% total adjusted revenue growth of which 5",neg,train
A very good result and we expect our risk management segment's 2018 organic and margin performance will be similar to the full-year of 2017,neg,train
"I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but when we met with you guys in December I believe the guidance in brokerage was for 3% to 3",neg,train
"5% and you did 6%, so was there sort of a lot of upside to that number in the second half of December or was there organic pulled from the first quarter of 2018 into that fourth quarter number",neg,train
"I guess that's my first question there, I have a follow-up as well",neg,train
"As far as the benefits business, I think you mentioned 6% that seems better than it has been I’m not sure who said that number but what's driving the growth there?",neg,train
"Last year, around this same time I said that 2017 brokerage organic felt like it would be similar to 2016 and it turned out to be better at 4",neg,train
I also said that I expected our 2017 risk management segment organic would improve over 2016 and it came in better at 5,neg,train
"Putting the two together, for the year, the combined brokerage and risk management segments posted 4",neg,train
"5% organic, truly a fantastic year that reflects our incredibly strong sales and service culture",neg,train
And when is the plan that you guys are going to give us I guess the pro forma's for 2017,neg,train
Our next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair,neg,train
"Third, the most notable number to me is the amount of cash taxes paid",neg,test
"In 2017, we will pay about $56 million in cash taxes globally",neg,train
"When we pro forma 2017 for tax reform, you will see we would have effectively had no cash taxes paid",neg,train
"So regardless of how you measure it, tax reform deliver substantially more positive cash flow",neg,test
Clearly a lot can change over the next decade but that shows the cash generation power of tax credit and investment,neg,test
"Darren, you want to open this up for questions, please?",neg,train
"Fourth, here's what we now as of now all which could change over the coming years",neg,train
"First, we believe that our cumulative effective of the change will be positive",neg,train
One could interpret that to mean than old GAAP was more conservative than new GAAP for us,neg,train
"We also believe that new GAAP will change our quarterly seasonality in both the brokerage segment and for clean energy investment earnings that are reported in our corporate segment, but that won't have -- but the new GAAP will not have much quarterly movement at all-in our risk management segment",neg,train
"And then, third, we believe that new GAAP will change our annual earnings upward in the brokerage segment but no real impact annually to the risk management segment or to the corporate segment",neg,train
"Well, I think what we're saying is right now, we think what we did in 2017 can repeat in 2018 maybe a little better, if pricing continues",neg,train
"As a matter of fact, we went think 3% in the first quarter, 4%, 4% 6% I don't think you can count on 6% in 2018",neg,train
We had a terrific quarter and we had a really strong delivery on several of our units but so we feel somewhere in that mid 4% range is better for 2018,neg,test
"Yes, I think the bigger story for us would be exposure growth and you really do have an acceleration of the economy that drops in pretty quickly",neg,train
I will go to the guidance remember our guidance in the third quarter I don’t think when we actually said 3% to 3,neg,test
5% if we did maybe we will be just a little conservative on that,neg,train
I think our guidance really was and we didn’t expect any margin expansion and we ended up getting 40 to 70 basis points on how we measure that,neg,train
"But we said that and at the time when we're sitting there in December week we had a terrific December, so based on through November we are probably some place in that, 3% to 4% range so",neg,train
So being a bit down in EPS really shouldn't matter,neg,test
"We've built a very talented team of professionals who work across geographies, across divisions to deliver high quality insurance, risk management and consulting solutions to our clients every day",neg,train
"So far, we're seeing Mark about a 1% uptick and not a huge uptick there",neg,train
"At December 31, 2017, we have approximately $700 million of tax credits that will reduce our cash taxes paid for a very long time and that doesn't change much with tax reform either",neg,test
There are no further questions in queue at this time,neg,train
"Finally, in the corporate table, you will see that we added a new line that shows the changes as a result of the U",neg,train
"It came in a bit better than we estimated on December 22, when put out our special tax reform related commentary",neg,train
"7% organic growth in the fourth quarter, with retail up 5",neg,train
In terms of the PC pricing environment in the U,neg,train
", we're seeing commercial auto up about 3%, property up about 1",neg,train
"6%, specialty lines up towards a point, professional lines are flat, workers compensation down towards two points, and frankly, when I look at that, that's a flat market",neg,train
"So very little impact on our domestic PC brokerage organic in the quarter, which is a slight improvement from what we had been experiencing earlier in 2017",neg,test
"On Page 3 in the pink box you will see that most of the corporate line estimates for 2019 are consistent with 2017, except when we now get a federal tax benefit of 21% versus 35%",neg,train
"What was -- if you could give us a general idea, what was the growth in your producer force in 2017 versus 2016 and I guess what are your thoughts on 2018?",neg,test
"Our Employee Benefits business generated organic growth of 7% in the fourth quarter and surpassed $1 billion of revenue for the year, a testament to the outstanding work of our more than 4,000 benefits teammates",neg,train
"I'm proud of how this business has delivered so much valued advice to our clients over the years, trying to navigate the ups and downs of the ACA as they tackle the task of managing their total employment costs in a competitive employment environment",neg,train
"Okay, with that said let me once again congratulate our sales and service professionals for a fantastic quarter and a great year",neg,train
When it comes to the longevity of the program right now we have credits that we believe even with some rapid growth in the U,neg,train
"So what the next up in tax credits, you got a decade or more to figure it out",neg,train
So it's not something I feel like we need to rush and do today,neg,train
To put more money into something that we don't need tax credit say until 2030,neg,train
"But I think we're pretty well-positioned right now for the next ten-plus-years of our lives when it comes to a really paying, we can pay 5% U",neg,train
"S corporate tax for the next 10 to 12, 13 years that will be terrific wouldn't it",neg,train
Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call,neg,train
"With me this afternoon is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating division",neg,train
"That means we will recap all the historical numbers for each quarter going back to January 1, 2016",neg,train
"Is that going to bring more deals to the market, or should that be a tailwind in 2018?",neg,train
And the IT refresh that you mentioned can you just remind like how often would something like that would occur in the business,neg,train
"As for risk management nothing under the headline results, just really solid year, a really solid year at 5",neg,train
And like Pat said we see for the risk management segment 2018 a lot like 2017 in terms of organic growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin,neg,train
"We are adding about 5% producer headcount as a result of acquisitions last year, also the follow-up",neg,train
My first question just follow-up on the Elyse question on the organic growth in the fourth quarter,neg,train
Can you give a little more color as to what's really behind the 6-plus-percent organic growth and why it's not repeatable?,neg,train
"And then on risk management, we think about workers comp claims any commentary on the underlying trend there, any indication that the stronger economy could lead to increased frequency?",neg,train
"So based on the comments where you're obviously you're basing everything -- you're running the company based on EBITDA sounds like that's something where it really should be expected to kind of hit the bottom line and it kind of if anything gives you more, capacity for M&A",neg,train
So it's a little hit or miss whenever we do that,neg,train
And at that point you'll also give us the corporate earnings projections by quarter for 2018 because I notice we just got the full-year outlook,neg,test
"Looking towards 2018, it would be hard for us to expand margins on organic growth at 3% or less but there could be some margin expansion on organic over 4%",neg,train
Our sales people killed it and that just don't happen every quarter,neg,train
Yes I would say that's especially around the catastrophe stuff,neg,test
There is an awful lot more marketing going on; people are pushing to rate there,neg,train
It’s not holding across the board but yes more people are in the U,neg,train
Next turning to Page 5 to the brokerage segment EBITDAC margin table at the bottom,neg,train
Headline adjusted EBITDAC margin was up 37 basis points in the quarter underlying that we did have two one-off items that compressed our margin expansion,neg,train
"First, our partially owned Mexico based affiliate had a tough quarter due to the Earthquake in late September that cost us about $1",neg,test
"5 million; and second, we did have a one-off technology improvement project in our U",neg,train
"Without those one-off items, margins would have expanded about 70 basis points and that feels about right on organic around 6%",neg,train
"Yes, I think there will probably be a one turn and a multiple as a result of it",neg,train
"Wholesale had a good quarter after the tough weather, are you seeing more inflow of risk into the market?",neg,train
"Okay, yes, I would be interested in the total number",neg,train
"And then as far as one, there's an investigation going on in London it would be interesting your thought there in",neg,train
Do you have a wholesale London business and if so how big is that?,neg,train
"As for cash, at December 31, we had about $315 million available on our balance sheet",neg,train
"And then my follow-up is on corporate, so before the adjustments I thought you guys were looking for a profit there and there was a little bit of a loss, so can you just walk me through what the weakness was for net income before the adjustments",neg,train
"Page 4 to the brokerage segment organic growth table, 6",neg,train
"8% all-in organic, what a great quarter and terrific finish by our sales and service professionals",neg,train
Recall in our third quarter I explained that we had some negative timing that would catch up in the fourth quarter and so it did,neg,train
"That said, even levelizing for that timing, we would have posted about 6% organic growth still really excellent performance",neg,train
"Now back to the fourth quarter results, starting with some comments about our brokerage segment",neg,train
8% all-in representing strong growth across all of our business units both domestically and internationally,neg,train
Just the first question in terms of the benefits to the broker segment from tax reform obviously has a pretty -- it's a pretty nice tailwind there,neg,train
To what extent you expect that to fall to the bottom line versus resulting in higher compensation or other sorts of items that could reduce the bottom line impact,neg,train
We don't run our company based on what the after-tax numbers are,neg,train
"Second of all, when you really look at the information we gave you, interestingly enough, we're showing you the statutory rates",neg,train
I think it's important to know had we recapped the last years pro forma and used really when you get out a few years 5,neg,train
"25% is what we will be paying in income tax in our domestic operations, when you get out about three or four years from now because of the tax credit, the gearing that you would see in the brokerage and risk management segment would go up lot",neg,train
"So here -- it's already up 15% now in those core segments together, you move that 21% rate down and the math down to 5% you'll pick up a ton more increase there",neg,train
And then one last question I know there were some an earlier question just in terms of I guess the fact that things seem to have gotten better towards the end of December after your Investor Day,neg,test
Do you guys have an initial view on how January has been that you can share with us entirely your full-year outlook for 2018,neg,train
I mean I don’t have a revenue number for you off the top of my head but it’s really one of the largest London brokers in the London market and yes the FCA is looking at the entire wholesale industry and we always believe that we do it right for the client and frankly we support the FCA's effort to look at that,neg,train
"(NYSE:AJG) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  5:15 PM ET",neg,train
I guess my first question in terms of the organic you guys said it was about 6% when you adjust for some seasonality in the shifting,neg,train
So when you're setting your outlook for I guess about 4,neg,train
"4% which is or a little bit higher which was a full-year 2017 level, what do you think, things will change I mean it doesn't sound like other than the shifting that things won't maybe get better from here, if you get some more price in 2018",neg,train

"It's my understanding that for the most part annual revenue should be unchanged please correct me if I'm wrong, so and as we think about you guys adopting revenue recognition for 2018 I guess that's margin accretive and then when we think about I know another broker had said that they had seen an expense benefit in 2018 kind of like a one-year adjustment for the deferral of some expenses",neg,test
"Is your comment that it is positive to your earnings stream is that an ongoing not just a one-year comment, can you just kind of tie a few of those things together",neg,train
And then in terms of that you guys provided a lot of disclosure on the pro forma impact of tax reform,neg,train
"I know part of it is, should that your, if we looked at the details you guys provided about a year ago probably a little bit more of an upside to 2016 and 2017 numbers",neg,train
And I think part of that was due to some deductions that you guys are losing,neg,train
"Could you just give us a little bit of color there, so we could understand the delta more between the two years?",neg,train
"But my last one is on your tax strategy, you have Glencoe business to lower your effective tax rate but now the U",neg,train
Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo,neg,train
Next let's turn to Page 7 of the earnings release to the corporate segment and then look at the clean energy line,neg,train
You'll see we had an excellent fourth quarter for clean energy,neg,train
"A bit of that was due to the cold snap we had in late December but have capped off another excellent year, a $133 million of after-tax earnings that's up 16% over 2016",neg,train
"We also had some better than expected results on the corporate line, mostly due to tax benefits from additional stock option exercises in the quarter",neg,train
The average size of the nine tuck-ins we completed in the quarter was $3 million of annual revenue,neg,train
"Our mergered acquisition pipeline remains robust with over $300 million of revenues associated with more than 40 term sheets either agreed upon, issued, or being prepared",neg,train
"In terms of why their earnings elevate is in general revenues will go up, there'll be a small impact on EBITDA that will go up",neg,train
I guess that would probably wash out in the margin to a certain extent but really we've been pretty conservative on when we recognize contingent commissions and also direct sales for carrier bills or installment bill policies,neg,train
But then you also have the stuff we initiated that we get pushed back but there is a net uplift in it,neg,train
Some of the comments made during the conference including answers given in response to questions may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws,neg,train
Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements,neg,train
"Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President, and CEO of Arthur J Gallagher & Company",neg,test
"So if we get to 4% there's margin expansion probably, someplace between 3% and 4% we will see how the year comes out",neg,train
"I would hope so but you just never now in this environment, being a low cost on that",neg,train
So it's not really that type of business that the popular press is talking about,neg,train
As for our clean energy estimates for 2018 also that we show on Page 3 a couple of comments,neg,train
"First, we're still working with our utility partners but at this time it looks like production levels in 2018 could be similar to what we experienced in 2017",neg,test
"And we also believe that production cost in 2018 would be similar to 2017, however those costs are now tax benefited at a federal rate of 21% versus 35%",neg,train
I will make a quick comment as I wrap up,neg,train
As we said a number of times 2017 was a fantastic year for Gallagher,neg,train
"I'd like to thank each and every one of our nearly 27,000 colleagues for their hard work",neg,train
"As we enter 2018 our focus remains on executing on each component of our value creation strategy growing organically, growing through tuck-in acquisitions, improving our quality and productivity, and maintaining our unique Gallagher culture",neg,train
Thank you for being with us this afternoon and have a great evening,neg,train
Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley,neg,train
Customer registrations for our user conference next week have increased by more than 20% compared to last year,neg,test
About 45% of the customer attendees will be attending our user conference for the first time,neg,train
The number of partner sponsors for the upcoming user conference events next has increased from 28 last year to 33 this year,neg,train

"Allen, product sales are tough, I mean that's the last couple of millions of our quarterly revenue every quarter, it's the toughest part of us trying to grow revenue",neg,train
"When you think about product sales, basically the way that typically works is we execute a contract with the customer and we deliver the product and then there is other times when customers will execute a contract and they don't want the product at that point of time and so it's delivered at some point in the future",neg,train
And most of our sales -- most of our contracts with customers include one product or another thinking about product revenue,neg,train
"We expect to leverage our improving operational efficiencies, rapidly increasing product development capacity, motivated and driven sales and services organizations and ever improving ability to address new verticals and growing contributions from recurring SaaS and maintenance revenues to improve overall performance, financial results and shareholder value",neg,train
"Moving down the income statement, cost of goods sold decreased 8",neg,train
"5 million in the third quarter versus the prior year period, mainly as a result of lower revenue",neg,train
"I would like to point out that cost of goods sold decreased for support, maintenance and subscription services inspite of its 6% revenue growth reflecting success with the cost structure initiatives we have been working on",neg,train
"This led to a total gross profit decrease of $600,000 or 3",neg,train
"4%, primarily as a result of lower product sales coupled with $300,000 of higher amortization of developed technology related to the previously announced general available of the latest version of rGuest Buy sales solution and the $6",neg,train
8 million of related software development cost that was placed into service in September of 2017,neg,train
During calendar 2017 we averaged more than one competitive replacement sales contract per week,neg,train
That competitive replacement sales contract count was multiple times higher during the last four months of calendar 2017 by the starting September compared to the first 8 months of the calendar year,neg,train
"We are now involved in significantly more discussions, demos and presales activities with customers compared to about six months ago",neg,train
It's only a matter of time before that increased business momentum starts translating into tangible and significant topline growth,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference",neg,train
This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Phil Bernard with Eilers & Krejcik,neg,train
2% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year but decreased by 13,neg,train
5% in comparing to Q4 of last fiscal year despite the 50% increase in our engineering development capacity,neg,train
4% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year but decreased by 15,neg,train
2% compared to fiscal Q3 of last year but about $1,neg,train
8 million of that increase is due to stock compensation and bonus expense which was a benefit to expense in Q3 of last year due to the forfeiture [ph] related to the departure of former executives,neg,train
Comparing G&A to Q4 of last year it has decreased by 1,neg,train
"And as we mentioned on the last call, we expect to end this fiscal year with a cash balance that is at/or slightly above $38",neg,train
3 million invested in the development of proprietary software and approximately $5,neg,train
3 million for the purchase of property and equipment and internal-use software development,neg,test
"And in terms of our NOLs, we currently carry approximately $200 million of NOL carry forwards with a full valuation allowance on our books, this will help us remain liable for only taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions along with minimal state taxes for the foreseeable future",neg,train
Our current NOLs expire between the fiscal years 2031 and 2038,neg,test
So I would like to return the call to Mr,neg,train
Our relationship with a couple of large international hotel chain has grown during the past few months creating another good growth opportunity,neg,train
"Along with InfoGenesis, our rGuest Buy platform providing self-service guest facing point of sale solutions is growing by leaps and bounds",neg,test

"As you are aware, Don DeMarinis joined us last week as our Senior Vice President of Sales, Americas",neg,train
Don joins us with extensive experience in hospitality technology sales,neg,test
"He was previously Vice President, Sports & Entertainment and Food Service Management at Oracle Micros and Vice President, Leisure & Entertainment at Micros prior to its acquisition by Oracle",neg,train
In the few days he has been with us we have already seen his ability to reenergize our sales teams and get going on our revenue growth initiatives,neg,train
We have enormous untapped potential for growth in the Asia and EMEA regions,neg,train
I plan on spending substantially increased time in both regions during this calendar year,neg,test
Thank you for joining the Agilysys fiscal 2018 third quarter conference call,neg,train
We will get started in just a minute with management's presentation and comments,neg,train
"But before doing so, let me read the Safe Harbor language",neg,train
"For example, rGuest Buy is now in the lab stage with one of those major hotel chains",neg,train
And the fact that the budget cycle has now changed to the start of the calendar year is also very helpful,neg,train
"So every passing week their productivity, their understanding of our products and what our customers' needs are is increasing every week",neg,train
"Looking at adjusted earnings from operations, I'm pleased with our performance given that even on $2",neg,train
"1 million of lower revenue our AOE would have improved compared to Q3 of fiscal 2017 had we not invested approximately $700,000 in TP&E for the expansion of our India Development Center",neg,test
This reflects the positive impact that our operational initiatives are having on the cost structure of our company,neg,train
We have increased our product development capacity by nearly 60% since the beginning of fiscal 2018 and expect to end the fiscal year in March with double the capacity we started the year with,neg,train
"We expect our employees to increase in their proficiency with our products and technology in general, exponentially overtime",neg,train
"(NASDAQ:AGYS) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  4:30 PM ET",neg,test
"I know you don't pay taxes today, I heard you say something about your NOLs that you can use the 100% of them; is there anything else in the new tax code that we should think about for -- that could have an impact on potential tax rate when you turn profitable?",neg,train
"Yes, Allen, we agree with you, Don is a very good hire and the management team really liked him a lot and our board liked him a lot and we are really excited about the hire",neg,test
"So he understands revenue growth well, he understands what it takes for a company to get better and grow",neg,train
As you've seen throughout the year our cost structure has changed a bit and especially as it relates to current cost that was compared to Q4 of last fiscal year our cost has come down and these amount and especially as a percentage of revenue,neg,train
"So we're looking into the quarter that we're about to enter or we're in right now, our fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, there is a component of revenue that obviously impacts that and then there is a continued decline in our cost structure that leads us to positive adjusted earnings from operations",neg,train
"One component that goes into that number, keep in mind is TP&E and development of software",neg,test
"I mean as we've transitioned our expensive external contract developers to internal resources, especially in India, that brings the amount of investment required to develop our software products down, that trend should continue",neg,train
"Thank you, Samra [ph], thank you for your help with the call",neg,train
"And as always, thank you all for joining us this afternoon and for the confidence you have placed in us",neg,train
We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our fiscal 2018 full year results,neg,train
"We do manage that very closely, internally though we don't discuss that number externally",neg,train
"Yes Allen, in our weekly sales schedule call we go through those numbers in a great degree of detail and to just -- and we don't discuss for the exact numbers outside but just to give you a qualitative idea of that compared to six months ago and even compared to say the September/October timeframe, the graph has definitely picked up, there is no question about that, there is just a lot more activity, our pipeline is really beginning to turn the corner and there is just a lot more activity for us to work on now than we had three to six months ago",neg,train
"We expect to finish this fiscal year at the lower end of our previous guidance of $130 million to $134 million, and expect to achieve the stated goal of Q4 FY18 being our first quarter of positive adjusted earnings from operations",neg,train
"Our India Development Center currently has about 200 employees on board, more than 90% of them in technical R&D related positions",neg,train
We expect to reach out new capacity of 330 employees before the end of June 2018,neg,train
"We expect greatly increased cost effective R&D to be a major growth driver for us during the short, medium and long-term",neg,train
The hospitality industry remains hungry for a world-class software technology vendor and we intend to be the one,neg,train
We continue to increase our technical software development capacity in the U,neg,train
And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Allen Klee with Sidoti,neg,test
Today's call and webcast will include non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Regulation G,neg,train
1 million of this decrease is due to services revenue recognized in Q3 of fiscal 2017 or services provided in quarters prior to that or contractual commitments precluded revenue recognition until that quarter,neg,train
"The remaining $200,000 decline is due to timing of customer installations and implementation projects",neg,train
"I mean well more than 90% of our revenue as you know, Allen, comes from the North American region, it comes mostly from the U",neg,train
Resulting gross margins for the fiscal 2018 third quarter of 49,neg,train
"6% in the prior year period, and keeps us in line with stated guidance for our annual gross margins to be in the low 50% range",neg,train
This improvement in gross margin is a positive trend for the company that should continue,neg,train
"Excluding the effect of software amortization from cost of goods sold, gross margin would have been 58",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allen Klee with Sidoti,neg,train
Today's conference contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U,neg,train
"Examples of forward-looking statements include among others, our guidance relating to revenue and adjusted earnings from operations, and statements we make regarding our ability to achieve revenue growth, profitability and improvements in financial results and shareholder value",neg,train
Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurance of future performance,neg,train
"Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions",neg,test
Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements,neg,train
"Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements",neg,train
"And then again, we have a bunch of smaller competitors who are struggling to scale and so there are issues associated with that when customers want to get more done and they are not able to scale they like to switch to us",neg,train
For now I would say they are mostly in the point of sales side and a little bit on the property management system side as well; but in future quarters I expect that to pick up on the PMS side as well,neg,test
We feel good about the state of our business as the fundamental we have been focusing on and discussing with you continue to improve,neg,test
"Our efforts to lower cost as a percentage of revenue streamline operations realign our overall cost structure and further leverage our resources, as well as maintaining a disciplined investment criteria across the business are beginning to take hold",neg,train
For your adjusted number that you guide to -- EBITDA minus CapEx and capitalized software; what do you anticipate changing by the end of the year compared to like where you are now that will turn that positive?,neg,train
"6 million in depreciation, amortization, legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges",neg,train
6 million tax benefit related primarily to the recent tax legislation compared to a net loss of $1,neg,train
08 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017,neg,train
1 million for the third quarter compared to a gain of $3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017,neg,train
"8% improvement through the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and importantly, a $2",neg,train
3 million improvement compared to Q4 of last year when adjusted EBITDA was negative,neg,train
Our customer service efforts have shown good improvement during the past couple of quarters,neg,train
"Simplifying the organization structure within professional services, enabling greater and more direct accountability for quality of implementations and customer satisfaction levels continues to yield good results",neg,train
We are now in a much better position to support larger clients into new markets and deliver quality solutions at a high velocity with less resources,neg,train
"Looking at operating expenses, excluding the charges for legal settlements in restructuring, severance and other charges, the third quarter saw a 13",neg,train
"However, operating expenses, last fiscal Q3 included reversals of stock compensation and bonus expense related to forfeiture [ph] due to the departure of former executives",neg,train
The important benchmark for us was fiscal Q4 of last year when we began executing on our operational plan and quarter-over-quarter comparisons will be more meaningful starting next quarter,neg,train
Operating expenses excluding the charges for legal settlements and restructuring severance and other charges decreased by 9,neg,train
"With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Tony Pritchett, to review our financial results and future outlook",neg,train
During calendar 2017 we added about 80 new customers to our portfolio and significantly expanded our business levels with about 200 customers,neg,train
"During Q3 FY18, that is the recent December quarter, we closed several important new deals, including a new customer, Camel Back Resort, who own a large full season lodge with a convention center and adventure park, a largely expanded business partnership with OCH Casinos involving a new property opening and purchase of new products, Holiday Inn Airport-Gulfport, who became one of our new InfoGenesis customers and is the first one to be implementing our new self-deployable InfoGenesis services model, and our current customer, Resorts World, installing rGuest Buy kiosks in their new upcoming casino opening in the classical area, New York",neg,train
"Do you provide any sense of like a pipeline of like deals you're working on or like -- or that -- any type of qualitative thing like that of a pipeline that gives you with sense of how you feel now, maybe versus how you felt a quarter ago or a year ago of the future outlook?",neg,train
"Allen, if I have to pick among all the factors that will drive higher sales and higher revenue from sales; if I list out all the factors and if I'm allowed to pick only one I would pick product delivery velocity because currently it is almost an internal challenge for us, the more we can get done in our products the more we can grow the company and in order to get that done we have to do it in a cost effective manner as well",neg,train
So the average experience level there with our products is about somewhere between three and four months,neg,train
"3 million, leading to a total gross margin of 76% on the back of the scalable nature of our infrastructure supporting and hosting customers and the positive impact of the changes mentioned earlier",neg,train
"8 million on the back of the lower professional services revenue, while gross profit margin decreased 20",neg,train
"However, we've begun to realize the benefits of restructuring our professional services workforce into teams responsible for named customer accounts as evidenced by our gross profit increase of $400,000 sequentially compared to Q2 of this fiscal year",neg,train
Thank you for joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2018 third quarter results and our path forward,neg,train
"Joining me on the call today is Tony Pritchett, our Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"The decline in topline largely reflects a decrease in product revenue and services revenue, however both grew sequentially compared to Q2 of this fiscal year",neg,train
Total revenue related to our rGuest platform comprised approximately 8% of total fiscal 2018 third quarter revenue,neg,test
"With regard to endpoints, we currently serviced about 255,000 rooms in around 44,000 terminal endpoints, compared to 244,000 rooms and 38,000 terminal endpoints in Q3 of last year",neg,train
"For example, just a couple of areas; number one, our current customers -- many -- I mean hundreds of customers use only one of our products, in order to sell more to them our product innovation velocity, our product innovation speed has to increase a bit more than what it is now",neg,train
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Agilysys Fiscal Year 2018 Third Quarter Conference Call",neg,train
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
"Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr",neg,train
My personal decision during November 2017 to double down on my February 2017 decision to buy a significant amount of Agilysys's shares was a well thought out financial decision,neg,train
I was not under any contractual obligation to do so,neg,train
You mentioned the market increase in competitive replacement to sales contracts this year roughly one every week,neg,train
Just curious if you could speak to any trends that you see either with respect to markets or our product verticals?,neg,train
"Looking at revenue in greater detail, product revenue decreased by $1",neg,train
2 million and represented 26% of total revenue during the quarter,neg,train
The decline in product revenue is mostly attributable to hardware,neg,train
"Support, maintenance and subscription services revenue are recurring revenue, increased $1 million or 6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, attributable mostly to SaaS revenue",neg,train
Total recurring revenue represented 55% of total net revenues compared to 48,neg,train
5% of total net revenues in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017,neg,train
The recurring revenue growth was driven by a 26% increase in SaaS revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017,neg,train
SaaS revenues comprised around 29% of total recurring revenues compared to around 24% of total recurring revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2017,neg,train
"And then with the large hotel customers, can you comment a little more on what's going on during -- what is anything else you need to do and how to think about how that could grow overtime?",neg,train
"You have a longer term growth target of revenue I think of around 10% to 20%, what has to happen, what factors have to change between where you are now to make you more comfortable that you think you will be at that level?",neg,train
"So when you think of it sequentially there are three aspects to that AOE; one is revenue, one is overall expenses and one is capital expenditure",neg,train
We obviously expect sequentially revenue to be higher in Q4 and we expected expenses to be down and also capital expenditures to be down,neg,train
We should benefit from that NOL for quite a while now,neg,test
"So the new tax legislation doesn't affect us all that much, there was a nuance [ph] in the tax law that caused us to recognize our tax benefit this quarter, specifically related to indefinite live intangibles but effectively we've got large DTA on the books, it's fully valued at this point so we'll continue in the current kind of situation we are today where we benefit from not paying much in taxes, especially in the U",neg,train
Now the big hotel chains that we are working with but the shift to the new calendar year is when their budgets open up,neg,test
So that is going to give us a drive for our revenue growth,neg,train
"So we are making progress towards that, the business momentum is there, our customer conversations are positive, we are not losing too many deals we are participating in, it is just that there are just a few more of these final steps in the product, in the services teams we'll have to get done and we feel good about how close we are now",neg,train
Revenue as compared to last fiscal year's third quarter decreased 6,neg,train
3 million leading to a GAAP net loss of $1,neg,train
This drop in revenue was primarily due to lower product sales which decreased 18,neg,train
"5%, as well as lower professional services revenue which decreased 17",neg,train
The increase in momentum we continue to see in our business everybody is yet to be manifested in our top line revenue numbers,neg,train
"In spite of that our adjusted earnings from operations metric for the quarter which is a measure of revenue minus all expenses, minus all capital expenditures improved over the comparable period last fiscal year",neg,train
"If we exclude the one-time capital expense of $700,000 incurred to double the capacity of our India Development Center which commenced operations during June 2017",neg,train
"The management team, a majority of whom have joined us during the past 9 months is leading together in one direction and driving a more cohesive teamwork oriented high work ethic culture",neg,train
"We are now more enthusiastic than ever before about our future, our near-term and long-term growth, our profitability potential and our increasing ability to address the needs and trends impacting the hospitality industry",neg,train
"With that, let's turn the call over to operator for your questions",neg,train
With products sales how do you visualize the trend in that going forward?,neg,train
Qualitatively there is no question about it and it is just a matter of time before revenue actually catches up with that,neg,train
we definitely have a much more -- much aider [ph] pipeline we are working with now than say six months ago,neg,train
"With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr",neg,train
"Product verticals I would say mostly in the InfoGenesis POS area, that's where most of our competitive replacement comes in",neg,train
"Here and there lower percentage, we do have BMS [ph] replacements where on visual one product replaces a competitor product as well",neg,train
So I would say a big majority of the replacements do come in the InfoGenesis POS area,neg,train
"And so just giving you a slightly broadened commentary on that, we are in a very unique space in this marketplace which is why we are so bullish on Agilysys in the not too big, not too small place, we are almost the only player, we have much bigger competitors than us who are in the $1 billion kind of annual revenue and there are customer services issues associated with those competitors because of which customers want to switch to us",neg,train
It is important to note that the tax law in place stipulates that all pre-existing NOLs prior to our fiscal 2019 can be utilized at 100% and are not subject to the 80% limit that any future created NOLs will be subject to,neg,train
"As it relates to our free cash flow, we expect free cash flow and adjusted earnings from operations to closely mere each other on an annual basis with the exception of any onetime cash payments like restructuring",neg,train
"As a reminder, free cash flow tends to the lagging of earnings from operations during the first half of most fiscal years and then getting ahead of it during the second half reflecting the timing of our annual recurring revenue billing and collection cycles",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"For the Indian Development Center, can you comment a little what you're seeing out of it so far and how that potentially translate into higher sales?",neg,train
"Regarding Don, your new head of America sales, he looks like a very good hire",neg,train
Any thoughts about just what this change in approach could be for sales?,neg,train
Any forward-looking statement made by us in today's conference call is based solely on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made,neg,train
"We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time-to-time whether as a result of a new information, future developments or otherwise",neg,train
"Thank you, Joe, and yes I’ll make a few comments and then I’ll turn it over to Ross, our CFO and then Don, our President and COO for total color on the quarter",neg,train
And the headline numbers for the quarter were actually at record levels and back to double-digit topline growth as we predicted in our last call,neg,train
I said the trend would change in Q3 and Q4 and the debt,neg,test
Animal reference ranges are also problematical in this new Alinity analyzer and improvements over the previous i-STAT,neg,train
"Most importantly, this instrument can connect them to the fuse platform, and we expect that to be completely completed sometime in June 2018 quarter",neg,train
"While forecasting can be challenging, we fully expect very healthy sales from the CRO sales activity in fiscal year 2019",neg,train
"So, can you give a little bit more color in terms of distributor margin",neg,train
"You talked about – share some of the distributors stocking up anticipation – in anticipation over the -- the change in margin, but on a go forward basis, if you are dropping the contribution down from let’s say 20% to 15%, would that be reflected in revenue and should we look at maybe the next 12 months as getting a revenue bump up from that?",neg,train
"On a global basis, Abaxis sold 228 Piccolos in Q3 compared to 212 in Q3 last year",neg,train
The increase in Piccolo instrument sales was driven by North America,neg,train
Into medical will now be our exclusive distribution partner in the Canadian point-of-care market and HealthTab [ph] will be our exclusive partner in the Canadian pharmacy space,neg,train
My first would be tended on new product contribution versus what call it kind of same customer contribution,neg,train
So you have launched a bunch of stuff over the last six to nine months,neg,train
How much would you quantify that wasn't in last year's revenue versus this year on kind of new products versus the base?,neg,train
"The performance of this test is outstanding, and we will be releasing performance studies in the next few weeks",neg,train
"Our sales team as well as our distributor partners are excited about this FLEX4 launch and in the process of being trained on the product performance, its’ advantages and our sales programs prior to the official launch of February 3",neg,train
We have high expectations for this product as there is currently a monopoly in this segment of the Rapids market,neg,train
"Maybe just two or three, first one on FLEX4, it certainly sounds like an interesting product",neg,test
You mentioned a 100 million market opportunity and you expect share gains,neg,train
"I know you had success in feline, is there a good way to think about what sort of share you captured in that feline opportunity",neg,train
I know that’s plus $100 million market but what share were you able to capture Clint over a couple of years and is a good data point when we think of where you might be able to go with FLEX4?,neg,train
"In the current quarter, your March quarter about 33% for fiscal year 2019 and beyond, they’re roughly 25% I mentioned in my remarks, range to 24 to 26 and pick the midpoint, that’s 25",neg,train
"This concludes my remarks, and I’ll now turn the call over to Don",neg,train
"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis",neg,train
Is it safe for us to assume that your relationship with Abbott has rolled over under similar terms as we saw in the prior 12 months?,neg,test
Our next question comes from Jim Sidoti of Sidoti & Company,neg,train
"Asking another way even we are selling through the distributor, I mean, is the right way to look at it before you were maybe selling the rotor to your distributor at 15 and now you’re selling the rotor to on them 18, I’m just throwing out arbitrary numbers here, but as a way to think about what the impact will had be on revenue here?",neg,train
The only instrument that fixing in those models is the VetScan that can go in that van and go from clinic to clinic,neg,test
So we’re working hard to keep building from that perspective,neg,train
And then quick follow-up on some of that you highlighted on a new product you’re launching at VMX,neg,train
One thing I was interested to not hear you discuss with the Amino acid platform,neg,train
Are there any updates on that? And how does that really – is there any impact there from the R&D spend? There’s a pretty stark decrease in spend this year I don't think you'll going to well below the original target,neg,train
Can you talk about additional product to be on the three you discuss there?,neg,train
"Looking at our smaller instrument product lines, on a global basis, Abaxis sold a total of 248 i-STAT and coagulation instruments in aggregate in Q3 compared to 146 last year",neg,train
"Importantly, Abaxis launched its new urine chemistry analyzer near the end of September and this quarter we sold 1,326 units of this device which far exceeded our expectations",neg,train
"I’ll comment real quickly and then Craig knows more about this than I do, but here’s the interesting thing",neg,train
"So we have a product offering where we give the veterinarian a choice, okay, because there are parts of the country for instances where there's no Lyme disease",neg,train
So does it make a lot of sense to run a FLEX4 or 4DX with there's no Lyme disease you’re running a lyme test,neg,train
"I mean I don't know, but the veterinary now has an option of either doing three single tests or one FLEX4 or two single tests or whatever they want to do",neg,train
"And those remind me where you are impacted earlier question on feline, when we launch the feline test several years ago within the first six months we did actually have material sales of that product and material gains in market share",neg,train
I think I call that out in several quarters recently including this one,neg,test
So to kind of circling back to the FLEX4 I think we do expect that to have a very good ramp for us in the first quarter or two have launched,neg,train
Our other recent product releases such as the canine specific lipase test and [Indiscernible] continues to be utilized in ever growing customer sites,neg,test
"Finally, we expect the release of our greatly enhanced thyroid rotor in June 2018 quarter",neg,train
"This enhanced rotor will allow for accurate thyroid testing up to 20 micro grams per decilitre, while our current test only provides results to 8 micro grams per decilitre",neg,train
"In terms of your modeling cannibalization, David, I really wouldn't give that much of any thoughts",neg,train
"So with that, I wish everybody a good afternoon and thank you very much for tuning in",neg,train
"Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch",neg,train
I will review our financial results and other important fundamentals for our third quarter which ended on December 31st,neg,train
Changes in foreign currency added approximately 1% to revenues this quarter,neg,train
"The agreement is rolled over for another year and we’re still in the process of negotiating a more permanent long-term agreement and yes everybody has been busy doing other things and I think everybody is pretty happy with the agreement as it stands, but clearly we’ll be talking about some fine points that people like to see improved in the agreement and that’s ongoing those discussions",neg,train
The urine chemistry strips have a very high gross margin for us,neg,train
"That is really big product but clearly that helps, and the FLEX4 will have meaningful gross margins as well",neg,train
"3 million last year due to higher sales of haematology, Piccolo, i-STAT and coagulation instruments, as well as contribution from our new urine chemistry instrument that launched in late September",neg,train
We expect the contribution in this quarter and yes from this point on going out through fiscal year 2019,neg,test
Our cost of goods for each rotor unit was $3,neg,train
I think the alignment that we’re doing where we’re focusing distribution and what they do really well,neg,train
And that’s rapid test and clearly the year end chemistry machine they do a very nice job with that,neg,train
"We’re maintaining the gross margins on those products, because they add a lot of value there",neg,train
And I think the fact that we now have all this distribution out there that is very good at selling rapid test in these is little urinalysis machines gives us a huge competitive advantage in these two market segments,neg,train
"And the fact that we do better selling our rotors and our instruments kind of by ourselves as far as closing the sale, but distribution does a better job of providing the logistics that we could",neg,train
But now they get to do it on a different level,neg,test
"They probably thought about an extra 40,000 rotors, roughly go ahead with the price increases that they are going to experience",neg,train
"I think in terms of looking at the March quarter, our expectation is we’re going to add more people out there selling or whether there’s going to be an impact or not",neg,train
We think we should be able to start boosting demand,neg,train
We have -- we don't have a large enough number of customers running all four of those tests to feel like we’re cannibalizing much of anything,neg,train
The single hardware market is a completely different market than the four plus market,neg,train
"That’s we want to run heartworm only, we’ll continue around heartworm only and we’re not going to be – that’s our largest by far test of those individuals",neg,train
50% of the hematology placements this quarter were into new accounts,neg,train
Our regional account managers -- where about to where we want to be there,neg,train
"We’ve got a class coming in this month and a class coming up next month, so we are shooting for about 70 of those territories",neg,train
The other team is -- one of the requirements to be on that team is that you are a – registered veterinary technician or a have been a veterinary assistant,neg,train
"And so they are technically strong, they understand the medicine, they speak the language and they know how to communicate very well with people in the clinic, and that’s the group we are looking for",neg,train
We continue to have success in the national and strategic account segments of the market,neg,train
One group expects to operate about 100 locations within the next two years and continued openings after that,neg,train
"I think that the rapid line in particular, our distributors are doing a really good job selling that and just kind of reorganized everything",neg,train
And so those numbers are new customers as well as increase user in our customer base,neg,train
"As Ross said, our rotor businesses is the low single digits, but those rapid lines are actually growing and there, let’s say, a little bit of contribution from this CPL test this year for last year",neg,train
"But since the whole rotor – the whole rapid like grew so well, it really didn't add as much you would think because of the performance of the rest of it",neg,train
"And -- but the customer base is stabilizing now and we’re seeing a good results from the new sales model, that should continue",neg,train
Our medical sales were up 18% year-over-year and worldwide vet sales were up 12%,neg,train
We continue to add more folks in the field as we expand our market coverage worldwide and in the R&D lab we continue to improve productivity with the development and the clearance of our FLEX4 rapid test and the schedule for introducing our urine sediment analyzer in Q4 is on track as well as continued progress with our high sensitivity immune assay system,neg,train
"The impact will be whatever the reduction in the distributor margin will add to our revenue, yes",neg,train
"I’ll just add, Clint covered all those comments points very well",neg,train
"I think part of the issue is the numbers we've been reporting on a GAAP basis or maybe a little bit depressed the last couple quarters because there were fluctuations in distributor inventories, look at end customer demand has been trending up about 3%, 4% the last several quarters, similar to my comment about how we give end customer here in the December quarter",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Block of Stifel,neg,train
"Craig Tockman - Vice President-Animal Health Sales and Marketing, North America",neg,train
Some of the instrument issues I think are kind of temporary obviously the i-STAT pricing like I mentioned there was a hematology promotion in one of our Asian market that we had an impact and a couple of just one off things,neg,train
"And then last question, year ago quarter was kind of choppy because of some inventory adjustments and issues with the distributors",neg,train
Where would you say the end user sales were this quarter compared to last year,neg,train
"Outside of North America, our sales of veterinary rotor units increased 12%",neg,train
"Rotor unit sales increased to low-teens pace in Europe, Asia Pacific increased at a mid single digit rate and Latin America increased at a double-digit rate",neg,train
I’ll try at the margin question first and then turn it over to Craig I think,neg,train
But Craig is being pretty aggressive with his hiring plans,neg,train
"We maybe give up little bit of income there, but obviously we are hiring these folks because we expect them in the company to be able to sell a lot more products",neg,train
"So yes by themselves, it’s probably – hurt us little bit on the operating income line, but certainly we expect a lot more productivity in increase revenues",neg,train
In the December quarter our Asia-Pacific business was driven by a strong haematology and i-STAT instrument sales,neg,train
The North American medical business is well-positioned for healthy revenue growing in fiscal year 2019 and beyond,neg,train
One more from me and it sounds like you are a little over a 100 or so people of the field we need to get to 150,neg,test
"Craig, can you maybe give us a better sense maybe a little more specific sense on how many, how many you need to add from here because it’s not clear that as presumably you added 10 or 20 this quarter, but can you often walk us through where you are looking to hire these people in that first class that’s in",neg,train
"Do these folks have that experience, do they have human experience, just give us a little bit of a flavor of how you are going about expanding such a significant piece of your business?",neg,train
"And then my second question will be on OpEx, with the changes with the salesforce additions I assume more product development, any way to frame kind of the run rate OpEx for the fourth quarter or fiscal 2019 maybe still too early for that, but how do we think about the 24 million or say this quarter kind of going forward?",neg,test
"With all of the new product releases from our pipeline ongoing R&D and our expanding sales team, we expect strong growth over the next several years",neg,test
These strategic adjustments have positioned Abaxis for much more success going forward,neg,train
You know your vet rotors historically or at least over the last several quarters have hovered in the negative one to flat to plus one or so,neg,train
"And then you put up a plus nine, you called out four points of growth in new margin related to the distributor impact",neg,train
"But it seems -- to go from minus one or flat to plus five normalize if you think that that is in fact the normalize growth trajectory, is pretty -- is a significant difference",neg,train
So if you could maybe call out one; do you think that plus five is a reasonable level with which you think you can execute on vet discs,neg,train
"And two, can you just kind of remind us what the key drivers are as we think about our models going forward?",neg,train
"Based on our prior experience with our feline combination test launched three years ago and our competitive properties of our new FLEX4 test, we are very confident that we will gain substantial market share in the $100 million market",neg,train
Moreover we believe our high expectations are well justified based on our distributor partners excitements to get out there and sell these tests,neg,train
"On a global basis during Q3, medical rotor unit sales increased 18% to 1",neg,train
The increase in medical rotor unit sales was driven by 19% growth in both North America and Europe,neg,train
"(NASDAQ:ABAX) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  2:45 PM ET",neg,train
Distributor margins have been reblended to enhance their work on where they can help us each day,neg,train
"Don, you mentioned three new products that you’re going to introduce at the show in Orlando",neg,test
Does that you’re going to start taking orders at that time,neg,train
And when do we expect those actually start to contribute to the top line?,neg,train
8 million last year as the increase in our gross profit was more than offset by the increase in operating expenses,neg,train
Rapid assay was the primary driver of growth for our other veterinary consumables,neg,train
Our feline test and our test for canine specific lipase were important drivers of our rapid assay business this quarter,neg,test
"I just thinking its not going to priced at four times a single, just kind of a way to think about it in terms of –basically what I’m trying to get out is your anticipated cannibalization of your own test and if there will be any on that?",neg,train
"Turning to our medical business, revenues for our North American medical division were up 25% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter to $7 million in the December quarter",neg,train
Rotor revenue growth was the driving factor up 16% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter to $5,neg,train
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr,neg,train
1 million were up 92% year-on-year but down 13% quarter over quarter although the growth was negative on the quarter after continues to place units and high-volume accounts and is our rotor growth as demonstrated in these results that truly drive our business,neg,train
"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Abaxis Reports Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Please also note that today’s event is being recorded,neg,test
"While the official launch of the new sediment analyzer will be a VMX, we began taking pre-orders on this analyzer earlier this quarter",neg,train
The sediment analyzer will connect with the VetScan UA urine chemistry analyzer to provide a true full urinalysis report to the veterinarian,neg,train
We consider our assay urine sediment analyzer our best-in-class instrument as we are using flow cell technology that does not have any of the issues that’s inherent in cartridge space technology or centrifuge samples,neg,train
"Comparison on the vet side maybe a little bit easier on the rotor side, but I think we kind of use end customer demand for our rotors growing in the 3% probably 4% range rate right now",neg,train
And obviously we expect that pickup as we get more people in the field,neg,train
On a GAAP basis we reported diluted EPS of $0,neg,train
This amount includes a one-time non-cash tax charge of $2,neg,train
9 million as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in December,neg,train
I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr,neg,train
"Erin, I’d like to thank some of what occur this quarter is kind of one time and maybe just volatility we have in our business from time to time",neg,train
"You'll probably notice I'm sure you track our rotor cost per unit, but they really kind of trended up by about $0",neg,train
I think we’re now in a position where the worst case our rotor costs are to be flat going forward,neg,train
So that’s the one material driver given that is a fairly big product line for us where we’d expect things to be better going forward certainly not a negative comparison in any way,neg,train
"Abaxis will be formally launching an unprecedented three new products at the upcoming VMX Conference beginning February 3 in Orlando, Florida",neg,train
"First, as announced on Monday morning by press release, we received USDA approval to begin marketing our new FLEX4 Rapid Test",neg,train
"The FLEX4 simultaneous test for heartworm antigen as well as antibodies to Ehrlichia, Anaplasma and Lyme disease on one cartridge with two drops of whole blood",neg,train
"This new test has a 12 month shelf life at room temperature, which differentiates us from our competition",neg,train
"Now turning to the international business, our international revenues increased 18% in December quarter compared to last year driven by 14% growth in Asia-Pacific, 13% in the U",neg,train
Overall revenues in Europe and Asia increased 18% and with constant currency 12%,neg,train
"I should note a reduction in distributor inventories of VetScans and haematology instruments in North America reduced revenues by approximately $700,000 in the quarter",neg,train
The gross margin was impacted by multiple factors this quarter,neg,train
"Some of these factors include slightly highly rotor cost, lower haematology reagent margin due to mix, slightly higher instrument manufacturing cost, lower [Indiscernible] for haematology instruments and low introductory pricing on our new urine instrument and discounted pricing on North America i-STAT unit in advance of the launch of a next generation i-STAT about two weeks from now",neg,train
"In addition, our close cell technology allows us to provide an actual count of components per volume",neg,train
It also produces exceptional images in our software allows the doctor to truly evaluate the results,neg,train
"When combined with the urine chemistry instrument results, it’s easy to use, simple dilutions and even with a very small sample will be attracted to the veterinarians",neg,train
"Turning to our animal health business, global veterinary revenues were $48",neg,train
"And if we are successful, okay at getting these products out the door, they have a very good shot at a 15% to 20% growth in our Q4",neg,train
And we do that with three prongs; one is the FUSE for the connectivity,neg,train
"And then, of course the third one is the new products, the FLEX4 and kicking these guys out of our accounts probably",neg,train
"The second product scheduled to launch at VMX is our new VetScan assay urine sediment analyzer, a new addition to our urine product family",neg,train
"Our first product entering the urine market, the UA urinary chemistry analyzer was launched at very last week of July 2017, and celebrated by our customers",neg,train
We replaced more than 1100 units since launch in North America,neg,train
This is one of our most successful product launches ever,neg,train
"We did have a relatively easy comparison in North America compared to last years quarter, but even after adjusting for this medical rotor sales in North America were very strong",neg,train
"Yes Jon, I’m not sure we want to give specific numbers, but I think the way we look at it as we with our feline test have gained material market share I think as we look at how that market changed with new entrants coming in several years ago, we think the new incumbent it was a sizeable piece of market share and we think that’s a good model as to how we could perform with the FLEX4 and we think we have roughly 30% of the chemistry market, I’m not saying that’s necessarily our target with FLEX4 but we think there is a big opportunity for us to get a big chunk of that market",neg,train
So I think we have a very big opportunity with that product and it also had an attractive gross margin for us,neg,train
"Revenues from other veterinary consumables, which we define to include hematology reagents, i-STAT cartridges, coagulation cartridges, urine analysis strips and rapid assays increased 12% to $13",neg,train
We expect to return on our investment with these new field people,neg,train
And so while short-term maybe a quarter or two you might see here,neg,train
As they become productive it ought to help mostly our consumable growth with these folks out there,neg,train
Our goal is to have about 150 field personnel in place by March 31,neg,train
These field personnel are well trained and actively working with our distribution partners and our customers,neg,train
"Our diagnostic specialists, our experienced veterinary technicians and assistants, they are already adept at having medical base utilization conversations to better assist doctors and staff",neg,train
So the answer to the first one is yes and the key drivers are the FUSE and our ability to get our customers back,neg,train
Also as I mentioned before with the launching of the FLEX4 and those accounts that love running four rapid tests at the same time we’ll be able to kick our competition out of our accounts,neg,train
So the objective is to continue to add new customers and keep your customer retention and a very very high rate,neg,train
"John, I don’t think we’re looking at disruptive event here",neg,train
"The existing salesforce, our regional account managers that are been responsible for doing everything",neg,test
"And I would say that the numbers themselves, of people is not really the issue, its making sure that we’re coordinating three teams now, the regional account managers, the diagnostic specialists and the distribution outside sales folks",neg,train
Consistent with the information we provided in our January 9th press release we estimate our income tax rate will be approximately 33% in the March 2018 quarter to be in a range of 24% to 26% in our fiscal year 2019,neg,train
"And so, I think that -- having that option for the customer is very helpful",neg,train
"Also we do have VetScan customers, okay, that for whatever reason they love doing four at a time",neg,train
"And so we have our competitor stuck in those accounts, okay, that are really our account, but in the past we didn’t have the FLEX4 and so IDEX was in there doing business with our customers",neg,train
Now we kick them on all together and we don’t have deal with that anymore,neg,train
"And so, as far as the pricing is concerned, I think, if you run four together it’s a little bit more attractive",neg,train
"At the conclusion of today's prepared remarks, we will open the call for a question-and-answer session",neg,train
"If anyone participating on today's call does not have a full text copy of the press release, you can retrieve it from the company's website at abaxis",neg,train
"This activity will be trained to utilization and working closely with our distributor partners, it can provide excellent care to your customers, enhance customer retention and improve growth in our sales",neg,train
"And Ross, if you break out the one-time tax charge, the tax rate was about 25%",neg,train
This will also provide our sales team and distributor partners another Abaxis product to discuss with the doctor and staff helping with our overall organic growth,neg,train
"So, we are now in the process of building the new instrument, okay, so we’ve done the chemistry now for the TSH, both the dog TSH and a people TSH and now we’re in the process of building the instrument, because we need two separate ways of reading, the chemistries are spectrophotometric and the high-sensitivity immunoassay are a switch in the wavelength, wavelength to move, and so we’re in the process now of completing the designs of the instrument",neg,train
Focusing on North American animal health we are pleased with the improvements in top line growth in Q3,neg,train
We have implemented some significant changes by altering our sales strategies and expanding our product portfolio,neg,train
The exchanges have already generated success in Q3 and we are planning for more changes coming in Q4,neg,train
"Jim, with the FLEX4, when you get the approval from the OCA that also gives you approval to begin manufacturing",neg,train
They give you the approval to now use all the procedures and think that they’ve blessed and we began with the notification that we got just this week,neg,test
So that's now rolling and we’re building up stockpiles of inventory for this point on,neg,train
And I’m just going to ask one real -- hopefully one quick one,neg,train
"Just in terms of that retail channel, I’m picking up that a lot of brick and mortar retailers are trying to do whatever they can to get customers off the online channel and into their stores",neg,train
What does it look like in terms of pipeline of potential retailers that could be looking at a veterinary – opening up of a veterinary clinic?,neg,train
"Matthew Rap - Senior Director of Medical Sales and Marketing, North America",neg,train
The FUSE connectivity system is now being shipped with most VetScan orders and we have additional pickups scheduled for this quarter,neg,train
"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review the financial results of Abaxis for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 which ended on December 31, 2017",neg,train
"As Andrea indicated, my name is Joe Dorame of Lytham Partners and we are the Investor Relations consulting firm for Abaxis",neg,train
"People aren’t going to leave the best chemistry instrument, when we have everything else equalized",neg,train
That’s what we’ve been trying to do for year and a half and we’re just starting on that path today,neg,test
"And so yes, I think that growth you saw was real and it’s because we’ve starting turning that shift and that shift continue",neg,train
Total revenues for our North American animal health business were $37,neg,test
"Within North American animal health, we placed 336 VetScans with end customers in Q3 compared to 493 last year",neg,test
"Of the VetScan placements this quarter, 53% were with new customers",neg,train
And obviously the idea is to ramp that up with all the initiatives the Clint just highlighted and those things we’ve been talking about for while now,neg,train
"And is that still accurate that the veterinary products would be the first and like you said, another 12 months than human would be another 12, 19 months behind that or?",neg,test
"The other three, there are much smaller piece of our business",neg,train
"We might see a little erosion in those three, but again like Clint said, some vets are using two of the test, three of the tests, that’s not going to change because that still less expensive than the 4 FLEX and those are the disease they want to test for",neg,train
"So we don't see a significant change in those numbers at all, because of all the facts",neg,train
So we are taking orders on the sediment analyzer already,neg,train
"So distribution, we’ll be taking those orders and we’re looking at shipping that product in March",neg,train
We expect the sediment analyzer to be ready for shipping in March with the eventual full connectivity into fuse platform shortly thereafter,neg,train
Our final product launch at VMX will be new Alinity analyzer from Abbott,neg,test
"Some significant improvements in the Alinity includes a large high -- resolution color touch screen, graphics driven on-screen help, results notification with sound, light and color and rechargeable battery allowing portable near patient testing",neg,train
This new analyzer is also equipped for multiple methods of software updates directly to the device,neg,train
"Within our consumable product lines, total rotor revenue increased 13% to $31",neg,train
57 million rotor units on a global basis in Q3 up 13% from 2,neg,train
"I think you can see the trend over the last several quarters; we’re doing with the hiring, Craig planning to get another 40 or 50 people on staff this quarter",neg,train
"These are less expensive than our traditional reps, but I don’t want to get too much guidance for where the expenses are going this quarter",neg,train
R&D will be a little bit higher than what you saw here in the December quarter,neg,train

Both expansions not only started in Q3 but showed immediate success,neg,train
"At the end of Q3, we had more than 100 active field personnel including regional account managers, area sales managers, diagnostic specialists, diagnostic specialist managers and professional service veterinarians selling analyzers and consumables",neg,train
So we should assume a small contribution in the fourth quarter and then having that accelerate into fiscal 2019?,neg,train
"The second group is a bit slower rollout plan, but also expects to get to more than 100 sites, so in the end we expect hundreds of new facilities running our chemistry, hematology and urine analyzers in the next several years with these contracts",neg,train
Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse,neg,train
We had some notable upsides in Q3 where we had really good performance with products and our distribution as it especially did itself,neg,train
"Our rapid tests were up, were 25% year-over-year and we sold over 1,300 urine chemistry machines in the quarter",neg,train
Our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen of Raymond James,neg,train
"With us today representing the company are Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Don Wood, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ross Taylor, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr",neg,train
"Craig Tockman, Vice President of Animal Health Sales and Marketing, North America and Matt Rap, Senior Director of Medical Sales and Marketing, North America",neg,train
"So, we really started placing FUSE with every VetScan as Don stated and current customers are now asking for it",neg,train
So we know that the connectivity issue has been one of the primary drivers of customers looking at other companies,neg,train
That’s why we’re investing so much time and money in them,neg,train

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Massaro of Cannacord Genuity,neg,train
"Within our veterinary business on a global basis during Q3, Abaxis sold 523 VetScan chemistry instruments compared to 665 VetScans last year",neg,train
"In addition, we sold 511 hematology instruments worldwide in Q3 compared to 362 in Q3 last year",neg,train
A diagnostic algorithm for i-STAT will also be available for doctors to analyze blood gas and acid-base values so they can better treat their patient’s,neg,train
"So whether in that office practice or rural setting, this next-generation product allows doctors to make timely informed treatment decisions at any point of care",neg,train
"A lot of have been asked already, but in prepared remarks you mentioned something about distributor purchases and North America Veterinary rotors added 4% points to growth rate",neg,train
Can you talk a little bit about what drove that? Was that an anticipation of the changes you discuss to yourselves for the new production or what and what you expect being more than normalizing 4Q or what’s going on there?,neg,train
Look this part of this how I feel and part of this I think is reality,neg,train
We have the best chemistry analyzer and we’ve been flat and because we’ve been – we’ve lost customers to connectivity,neg,train
We’ve lost customers to find the work with our distributor partners in the wrong way and we lost customers because we haven't had the bandwidth to not only keep them but to grow what they do,neg,train
"And so when push comes to shove now that we have the connectivity, we have the right relationships, we have a better understanding of our work together on both sides of that equation with our distributors",neg,train
"Since you're already taking preorders on the year in sediment analyzer, can we expect to see a prototype in your booth next month, and do you think this is the final size of the box?",neg,train
"Going down at different roads, some changes obviously going on with your approach to distribution",neg,train
"First question want to sure should we think of this as somewhat of a wash where you are obviously bringing on reps, but you are also cutting back in the margin, you are paying to the distributors",neg,train
So does that largely net out or how do we work that through a models,neg,train
"And in general in the veterinary industry those folks are not very well paid, our package is extremely attractive to them, we are not having any trouble getting recruiting for these positions",neg,train
"51 million units in the third quarter, up 9% from 1",neg,train
Sales of veterinary rotor units in North America were up 8% in Q3,neg,train
We estimate distributor purchases in advance of our changes in their margins added approximately 4 percentage points to this growth rate,neg,train
"And so, I think this is – all part of this whole process of understanding where distribution works really well and where we work better together with them, okay, but not just delegating it all up to them but just delegating part of it up to them",neg,train
And I think we’ve got this stuff figured out now,neg,train
And I think you'll see – I think you’ll see results of that going forward,neg,train
"So, I think we got aligned really well right now",neg,test
We think underlying end customer demand for the Piccolo rotor remains very good in North America and on a global basis,neg,train
"And thinking about FUSE and how that’s helping you or should help you in terms of retentions, I guess what is that been kind of this point? Or can you remind us where you are in terms implementation? Thanks",neg,test
"Yeah, it’s on the prospect to put them all together",neg,train
"So I don’t what’s your, David, where you looking for as far as?",neg,train
G&A increased significantly from last year primarily due to a very low bonus payout in December quarter last year and higher stock compensation expense compared to last year,neg,train
"And then, can you talk about on the 4 FLEX, what the pricing strategy might be relative to the existing one-off? How should I think about in that in terms of a ratio and how you’re going to price?",neg,train
"So overall in summary, with all of our new and significant products, our field sales and marketing team expansion and our strategic improvements in our distribution responsibilities, we expect strong double-digit growth in [Indiscernible] fiscal year 2018 and in fiscal year 2019",neg,train
During Q3 revenues for our global medical business were $10,neg,train
"That’s a little bit hard to quantify, Nick, just off hand right now, but I think our chemistry customer base and we’ve talked for a while is then flattish for a good 18 to 24 months now",neg,train
"Some of the other product lines, your rapid assay, you hematology, we are getting, increased customer penetration with each one of those obviously international markets were – most of the growth is coming from increases in customers, some same-store use",neg,test
I don’t know if Craig has anything to add to,neg,train
"And then of course once you get the first one done, the rest are more lot easier because it just a change in antibodies and those kind of things to add new high-sensitivity immunoassay",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
"And with that our strategic accounts team that travels with all these folks, so we are almost there",neg,train
I don’t see any problem being there by end of April,neg,train
"Well, keep in mind the tax actually going in effect for part of our fiscal year",neg,train
"What occurred in the December quarter is a true-up, bringing the rate down to that level",neg,train
So for entire fiscal year 2018 we expect the rate to be about 33% and that’s for the Q4 -- our March quarter numbers is going to be,neg,train
In addition over 30% of our customers have already reordered strips with the majority of those being the premium UA 14 test strip which offers a doctor a protein/creatinine ratio and micro albumin levels at a very attractive price in comparison to competitive products,neg,train
Don will discuss this next-generation i-STAT called the Alinity in a few minutes,neg,train
"Today, I’ll focus my comments on the most important highlights for this key area",neg,test
"So it’s more of a coordination effort, but Clint said, we expect production out of this new team",neg,train
We’ve already seen benefit as Don mentioned in his prepared comments,neg,train
"I can give you multiple samples of these new folks walking into our customer base and looking at older instruments that might need warranty work to repair that already turned into upgraded sales and uses of new rotors that doctors won’t even aware that we have, because we just haven't had enough people to sell rotors every day",neg,train
"Maybe that 12 to 18 months, you have the regulatory process on the medical size",neg,train
"Before we begin with the prepared remarks, we submit for the record the following statements",neg,train
This conference call may include statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,neg,train
"Specific forward-looking statements contained in this conference call may be affected by risks and uncertainties, some of which are detailed under Risk Factors and documents filed by Abaxis with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017",neg,train
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made,neg,train
"Abaxis does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise",neg,train
"I think the comparison issue for last year was mostly with our North American Piccolo business where we did, have down rotor sales last year",neg,train
"Our sales this year with the Piccolo rotors were just terrific, so I think even if we adjust for that easy comparison with Piccolo business we had very healthy demand for the Piccolo rotor both in Europe as well as North America and from Abbott",neg,train
5% at the end of the year at a total risk-based capital of 19,neg,train
They did reference the press -- other press release that went out this morning,neg,train
"On the liabilities, we did see an increase in deposits from year-over-year, increased from $544",neg,train
Nearly all of that increase was in the noninterest bearing deposits,neg,train
They increased from $201 million up to about $216 million at the end of 2017,neg,train

"With the leadership change in the fourth quarter, I became the CEO and started my role in November 6, 2017",neg,train
"Yes, I think it's -- what we can do is we’re going to report hires",neg,train
"Like Dave said, we hired a relationship manager, started this week",neg,train
"Still getting our arms around all of the impact of the tax reform, but right now we're -- we think the 2018 effective tax rate is going to be somewhere in the 24% to 28% range",neg,train
Thank you and let me turn it back over to Dave for some additional comments,neg,train
We have successfully hired one new relationship manager who started this week with hopes to hire additional relationship managers in the next few months,neg,train
We certainly appreciate him for his hard work and dedication and wish them the best,neg,test
We got some good sales people right now as well,neg,train
"But we are just a more of them and I think the results will show on -- when you hear me talk about the numbers,",neg,train
"For the year, we added just $130 million compared to $89 million in new loans from 2016",neg,train
The average rate of new loans during the fourth quarter of this year was 5,neg,train
19% and the average rate on the renewed loans was 4,neg,train
I wouldn’t rely too much on those as a - forward-looking numbers,neg,train
Deposit costs on checking and savings in money market accounts that actually decreased slightly from 6,neg,train
The increase in the CDs and FHLB borrowings really that's the result of the renewals rolling over slightly higher market rates,neg,train
"Overall cost deposits for 2017 was 16 basis points, up from 14 basis points in 2016",neg,train
"Again, that’s due to the higher cost of the CDs",neg,train
"Yes, I think that if you might think this way, if you get the right people, it's probably not half a dozen but it's probably between 4 and 5 and strategically placed, I think we'd be in a good position",neg,train
"On the income statement, not much swing other than the things that I previously mentioned, but I will quickly go through this",neg,train
The business relationship officer you picked up where are they based -- situated in Sacramento area?,neg,train
And so I think the very tax situation can really help the C&I side for banks in general,neg,train
"To assist with this growth strategy, in December we successfully hired a Chief Lending Officer",neg,train
We will now be upgrading our team of relationship managers and are presently evaluating resumes,neg,train
9 years and price change and rates up 300 is still under 10%,neg,test
"Noninterest balances, those make up 39% of our total deposits",neg,train
The average cost of funds did increase 4% from 26 basis points in 2016 to 30 basis points in 2017,neg,train
And reason for this increase is higher rates paid on our FHLB borrowings and our CD costs -- some of the CDs that rolled during 2017,neg,train
The increase in our -- in the short-term market rates does not have much of an impact on our core deposits though as rates remain stable,neg,train
And I will now turn the call over to David Ritchie,neg,train
"As I did mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2017 did include the cost associated with leadership change",neg,train
"About 597,000 of that change was in the salaries and benefit line, and then $79,000 was in other expense primarily in professional expenses",neg,train
"We did benefit from $177,000 in recoveries, but we also charged-off $4,000 on one relationship",neg,test
"For 2016, we’ve $515,000 in net recoveries in the fourth quarter and $1",neg,train
"Now Mitch Derenzo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide an in-depth discussion of our year-end financial results",neg,train
"I’m guessing that the -- well the priority is right now is the Santa Rosa market, followed by the Sacramento market",neg,train
I think it's really important that we find a senior-level person for that market,neg,train
Both were negative for the quarter at 24 basis points and 1,neg,train
We did report the core non-GAAP adjusted net income of $1,neg,train
"19 per share figures for the fourth quarter in the press release as well as a reconciliation of the quarter to actual, so we referred you that session",neg,train
The press release if you want to see that details of the reconciliation,neg,train
We are receiving on the -- back of the nonaccruals,neg,train
We are receiving payments on two of the nonaccrual loans and the one that isn't paying is the one that’s in the contract to sale,neg,test
So my guess is they’re not making the payments until the -- because they’ve sold the business,neg,train
"No, we talked briefly on this last quarter and really we haven't seen much change since then",neg,train
"Unfortunately, we’ve some of our clients lose their homes, but they’re not on -- we don’t do residential lending",neg,train
"It's going to be some -- a long, long time rebuilding",neg,test
"Hopefully there's something we can do to help out the community there as far as lending and whatnot, but no significant impact on the company -- on our company from the fires",neg,train
We've also expanded our marketing budget to help us be a more visible bank and the communities we serve,neg,train
Also we did include some economic data in our press release,neg,train
And our next question comes from Don Worthington from Raymond James,neg,test
"Noninterest income was up about $449,000 -- sorry, it was down $449,000 primary that’s OREO income",neg,test
"We no longer have the income producing property and then investment sales, investment sales were down",neg,train
"If you talk, if you think about relationship managers, usually the hiring in that business right at the end or the middle of the first quarter because a lot of incentives, a lot of other banks were paid at that time and it takes a little time for somebody to get in here, to the extent they call and talk to some of their old clients about the new banking experience",neg,train
"Most clients will say, well, do you like it there, how long you’ve been there? So my guess is that -- this will be somewhat back loaded in terms of pipeline, in terms of production and just because we're starting at a very low level today",neg,train
But I think after that it will ramp-up for really good kickoff for 19?,neg,train
"Well, one of the things Dave came in -- those are questions he's asked",neg,train
And we’ve -- we’re going through all of our deposit account agreement and making sure we’re getting paid for what we do,neg,train
We tend to have a lot of high balance accounts,neg,train
"But it is something -- we try to do, but it's never going to be our bread and butter",neg,train
We are going to be a block-and-tackle and net interest income company,neg,test
Our classified equity ratio at the end of the year was just 4,neg,train
"9 in nonaccrual and $961,000 in OREO, a combined total of just $2,853,000",neg,train
"Great and stepping back and looking at what you like to accomplish how much room, how many officers, bankers do you -- would you like to -- if you’re successful, bring a board say this year",neg,train
How many would you like to add? Like a dozen? Is it -- can you …,neg,train
"Hopefully I asked all of Worthington's questions for him already, but I will step back now",neg,train
That adjustment also distorted the effective tax rates for 2017,neg,train
"For the fourth quarter 2017, the effective tax rate was 134",neg,train
"For the full-year, the effective tax rate for '17 was 54",neg,train
"And then just kind of looking out into the future, any, I guess, initiatives to increase fee revenue?",neg,train
"Mitchell Derenzo - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & Executive VP",neg,train
What do you guys -- how it's going to translate and maybe the numbers will start to show up by then,neg,train
"And I appreciate the guidance you gave on or the clarification on kind of what a range of tax rate might be, a lot of banks were doing that now and that's really helpful and appreciated, very helpful",neg,train
"But based on the accounting rules, always future payments must be expensed when the liability is created",neg,train
"At the end of 2016, the unrealized gain added about $0",neg,test
08 to the tangible book value per share whereas at the end of 2017 we had reduced by about $0,neg,train
6 million and the borrower does continue to make payments,neg,train
"9 million at the end of 2017, down from $2",neg,test
"3 million at the end of September this year with the decrease being the $4,000 charge-off",neg,train
Still have the same -- three nonaccrual loans that were in the books of September 30,neg,train
On the commercial property we expect a full recovery from the sale proceeds assuming that the sale does close at the current sales price,neg,train
"We’ve two loans past due over 30 days, by excluding the nonaccrual loans, of course",neg,test
"But I guess last question qualitatively, is there -- are there -- do you have -- can you share thoughts on how you might get back to and obviously there are sector driven considerations here as far as C&I is concerned and C&I growth a lot of banks are facing",neg,train
"A lack of interest in utilization of lines, so it's not unique to you, but you guys have seen a good C&I book of business that at peak was, I don’t know multiple times larger than what it is today",neg,train
Do you have thoughts on how you can find success in growing that book of business here going forward that might be a little bit different than what you’ve been doing last year?,neg,train
"Both of -- actually, our Chief Lending Officer as well as the first hires in Sacramento",neg,train
Allotment in the fourth quarter was driven by the income tax expense adjustment to our differed tax asset,neg,train
"Most of you been aware than the Tax Act required us to revalue the company's deferred tax asset, using the new lower corporate federal tax rate of 21%",neg,train
That’s a reduction from the company's 2017 rate of 34%,neg,train
"As with past conference calls, I'm going to highlight some of the key areas of the press release that we issued this morning",neg,train
"try to provide some additional details and analysis, and then we will turn it back over to Dave for some additional comments, then we'll open up for to answer questions",neg,train
"My name is Victoria, and I'll be your operator for today's call",neg,train
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session",neg,train

06 per share in the fourth quarter of '17 compared to a positive $0,neg,train
"So call it a decrease from -- $400,000 from the $13",neg,train
"Those decreases occurred in OREO, again lower number of properties, less expense, OREO expense was down little over $200,000 and then occupancy that was down about $125,000",neg,train
"The lower occupancy, really that's based on -- we’re doing better job of managing the size of our facilities",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"And then, do you feel Dave like -- there is a point in time here this year maybe where you are going to want to provide or intent to provide color on, a production pipeline or build out or something along those lines are how should we -- how should we and investors track success and progress in your efforts",neg,train
"Now the $400,000 charge-off I just mentioned that happened during the fourth quarter this year but at the same shared national credit loan that I discussed during my analysis last quarter",neg,train
And where are you looking for new relationship officer is currently? What’s the priority which you are focused?,neg,train
"In 2017, portfolio moved from a net unrealized gain position to a net unrealized loss position",neg,train
"At the end of 2017, the unrealized loss was $456,000 compared to an unrealized gain of $916,000 at the end of 2016",neg,train
Of course that also impacts the tangible book value per share,neg,train
"For the fourth quarter of this year 2017, we did repurchased 241,662 shares of our common stock",neg,train
"And then for the full-year of 2017, the company repurchased 574,748 shares that also was an average price of $14",neg,train

"The loan paydowns during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted in $111,000 of annual penalties that compares to $54,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
"Year-to-date prepayment penalties were $213,017 compared to $220,000 for 2016",neg,train
"5 million from September 30, 2017 and for the full-year 2017 loans decreased $15",neg,train
New loans added during the fourth quarter tailed off to just $4,neg,train
1 million that compares to $23 million in new loans or in fourth quarter 2016,neg,train
So in terms of -- have you noticed any issues with the Northern California fires that have impacted businesses or any of your customers?,neg,test
"Just prior to joining American River Bank, I worked at US Bank in Los Angeles",neg,train

My career has been all in middle-market lending including real estate and C&I,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question comes from Tim O'Brien from Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
Still well structured cash flowing mortgage products and some high quality -- high credit quality municipal bonds,neg,train
"On the year-to-date basis, net income in 2017 was $3",neg,train
"The biggest change is year-over-year, obviously the two unusual items that we discussed as well as change in the provision for loan and lease losses",neg,train
"And then, give us a lot of color on your expectations for next year and I guess maybe I look at all of the guidance you provided for one wildcard would be kind of the credit costs you guys note obviously it's kind of going to have to adjust relative to the environment",neg,train
"I mean is there anything on the horizon that you see coming that that could meaningfully change your kind of credit costs and how are you thinking about the provision, if the environment holds as it is today, how do you think about the provision trending through the year?",neg,train
"As outlined on Slide 2, during the course of discussion today, management may make statements that constitute projections, expectations, beliefs or similar forward-looking statements",neg,train

"At year end, our loan to deposit ratio was 91% compared to 92% from the year ago quarter and 94% in the third quarter",neg,train
"And then, Chris just sort of a geography question on the unusual items",neg,train
The REIT and power and utility books are generally investment grade and have spreads that are sometimes 50 to 100 basis points lower than the general commercial credit portfolio,neg,train
The average yield on residential mortgage loans also decreased during the quarter driven by a higher level of repayments than anticipated,neg,train
Deposit betas is generally for our core retail books have been benign and we don't necessarily see that shifting although we do see a competitive build up,neg,train
So built into our outlook is an expectation that there will be a little more responsiveness in retail in 2018,neg,train
"We haven't necessarily seen that yet, but that's certainly an expectation going into 2018",neg,train
We would also like to talk for a moment about margin noting that we leave 2017 with a fourth quarter margin of 2,neg,train
We expect to benefit from 3 Fed rate increases and Bank Mutual's slightly higher loan yields,neg,train
"Together, we could expect to add 6 to 9 basis points as we move through 2018",neg,train
As such we expect to see 3 to 6 basis points of net NIM expansion in our 2018 period,neg,train
"And then, maybe one more on credit the drop in the potential problem loans, I might have missed in your prepared remarks, is that just oil and gas bookers or anything else that shouldn't permit? Thanks",neg,train
Lastly the credit environment remains strong contributing to our solid growth in year-over-year earnings and dividends,neg,train
Anything to do with the acquired investment portfolio from -- that's coming over or should we think in just -- add your 6,neg,train
"5 billion, and you got to settle out around a $7 billion",neg,train
"We have continued to be active oil and gas cylinders throughout the downturn, I think we've talked before that",neg,train
In these kind of businesses you don't try to jump in and out of the market,neg,test
"So out of the 56 credits that make up our loan portfolio, 22 of those are new since prices declined about half of our commitments and almost half of our outstandings are new since prices reset",neg,train
We expect the 2018 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22%,neg,train
We continue to target at CET-1 ratio within a range of 8% to 9,neg,train
Mortgage baking income decreased $19 million from the prior year due to the company's on balance sheet mortgage retention strategy and lower market volumes,neg,train
"For 2018, we expect total non-interest income including Bank Mutual to be between $360 million and $370 million with increasing year-over-year fee-based revenue",neg,train

"As a reminder, the transaction is an all stock deal for the fixed exchange ratio of 0",neg,train
422 shares of Associated common stock for each outstanding share Bank Mutual common stock,neg,train
6 million shares Associated common in connection with this transaction,neg,train
Non-accruals decreased $67 million from 2016 primarily due to improvements in the oil and gas book,neg,train
"Outside of oil and gas, total non-accrual loans increased just $4 million from 2016",neg,train
"In total, non-accruals represent 1% of total loans at year-end",neg,train
Total non-interest income decreased as expected on lower mortgage banking income,neg,train
We kept expense growth under 1% and we're able to improve our efficiency ratio by nearly 100 basis points from the prior year,neg,train
We've now improved our efficiency ratio for six consecutive years,neg,train
Commercial and business lending was down 2% from the prior quarter reflecting seasonality in both our general commercial and mortgage warehouse businesses and modest pay downs in the power and utilities portfolio,neg,train
Commercial and business line utilization dropped to 50% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and remained at approximately 50% utilization throughout 2017 down from the low to mid 50% range in the prior two years,neg,train
We would expect proportionately that both CRE and C&I would provide more growth than they did this past year,neg,train
The pipeline for commercial real estate is pretty attractive at the moment,neg,train
"Commercial, we really do expect the impact of the Tax Act to start to generate more activity amongst our commercial borrowers",neg,train
There's growing optimism out there and we would expect particularly as we get further into this year to see more activity there,neg,train
"For 2018, we expect an improving loan yield trend to be partially offset by impacts of the Tax Act on our investment portfolio leading to a modestly improving year-over-year net interest margin trend",neg,train
"We will have a significant number of $100 million plus footings branches, which is great for driving our efficiency",neg,train
"Excluding the expenses related to the Tax Act, we reported earnings of $1",neg,train
"52 per common share, 2017 benefited from higher net interest income, improved efficiency, well-managed expenses and higher returns on capital",neg,train
So it's a long way of saying I'm not going to put a number on it because we never really can do that,neg,train
But the outlook is awfully positive for credit quality as we sit today,neg,train
Thanks for all the color on the outlook for 2018 very helpful and what can be a little bit confusing here,neg,train
"But, do you expect to return to kind of CRE growth next year or any other categories within the kind of the C&I buckets that you expect to be relatively stronger year-over-year?",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 9, full year net interest income was $741 million up 5% or $34 million from 2016",neg,train
The growth in interest income was driven by $89 million of loan interest income principally offset by $61 million of funding costs reflecting the bank's overall asset sensitivity,neg,train
"Our next question comes from Jared Shaw, Wells Fargo Securities",neg,train
"And then on the expenses, just to make sure I understand the guide, the 780 is that on an operating basis, the full year or is that suggesting just take the 195 for the fourth quarter and annualize it? I'm just trying to get",neg,train
"At the same time, as you're aware, we've been reducing our use of network deposits as core deposit growth has continued to be sort of available on a marketplace at a reasonable cost",neg,train
So just to correct something you said we expect conversion actually in early summer not fall,neg,train
So we've -- that timeline has moved a little bit from when we first announced the transaction,neg,train
As far as M&A there's I think a favorable regulatory environment in place right now,neg,train
"For 2018, we expect to maintain a loan deposit ratio under 100% with a seasonal high at the end of Q2",neg,train
"In summary, on Slide 17, we'd like to summarize our 2018 outlook",neg,train
The outlook reflects a stable to improving economy and the impact of corporate tax reform,neg,train
The outlook assumes the closing of the Bank Mutual transaction on February 1,neg,train
We expect pro forma mid-single digit annual average loan growth on the combined portfolio and we expect to maintain the loan to deposit ratio under 100%,neg,train
Commercial real estate lending increased 5% from the prior year driven by growth in our construction-related portfolios,neg,train
"CRE continues to account for nearly a quarter of our average total loans and is well-diversified by geography, property type and borrower",neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train
IN NO WAY DOES SEEKING ALPHA ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY TRANSCRIPT,neg,test
USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
"Looking forward, we believe the Tax Act lays the foundation for a lower effective tax rate",neg,train
"Our outlook assumes a lower statutory tax rate of 21% smaller net benefits from tax exempt securities, BOLI and tax credit investments and the expectation of a number of new disallowances particularly FDIC insurance which will result in our corporate effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22%",neg,train
"On Slide 4, at the end of the year, the Tax Act was signed resulting in a number of immediate 2017 impacts and an improved tax outlook",neg,train
"For 2017, the company recorded $15 million of Tax Act related expenses primarily driven by a partial write-down of the company's deferred tax assets",neg,train
These expenses reduced reported GAAP earnings per share by $0,neg,train
"So, we are doing both, so the 780 is the full year number on an operating basis, the 820 is the full year number for GAAP",neg,train
It's also going to be about 190 to 195 in Q4 of 2018,neg,train
So you'll be able to look at Q4 2018 and you'll be able to tell us we are on the right path,neg,train
2017 loan details are highlighted on Slide five; average loans grew about 5% or $942 million from the prior year,neg,train
Residential mortgage has represented approximately 35% of our average total loan book at year end and over 70% of our on balance sheet mortgages or ARMs which generally repriced within three to seven years,neg,train
We know our customers are going to benefit; shareholders are going to benefit from increased net income,neg,test
"I guess on the deposit side as we go through and see the next round of rate hikes, what are your expectations for deposit beta there? And in terms of the mix shift, do you feel that we've sort of stabilized here or should we still expect to see I guess a continued trend towards time?",neg,train
"Finally, the loan loss provision is expected to adjust with changes in risk grades other indications of credit quality and loan volumes",neg,train
"Overall, our deposit sources are balanced with our checking and savings accounts representing 50% of total deposits",neg,train
So you just us provide zero in the fourth quarter,neg,train
I would not recommend that you use that as a baseline,neg,test
"But not to be facetious, I think the oil and gas portfolio has significantly improved at this point",neg,train
There is still a couple of transactions that could generate some losses,neg,train
So we think the oil and gas issues that we've lived with the last few years is essentially behind us,neg,train
There is no other stress of any systemic or meaningful amount sitting in the portfolio today,neg,train
That doesn't mean there aren't always a few bad credits or losses to take but there are no indications that credit quality is slipping anywhere,neg,train
"The up tick in the fourth quarter in the brokerage line, was there any one-time payments or seasonality within that business",neg,train
And could you just talk about the outlook for 2018 specific to that line,neg,train
"In 2017, we saw a modest remixing in our deposit composition driven by higher interest rates",neg,train
Savings and time deposits increased by $526 million or 18% from 2016,neg,train
"During the back half of 2017, we shifted our funding mix away from network transaction deposits and toward time deposits",neg,test
Interest bearing demand deposit accounts grew $544 million from prior year as customers start to participate in the rising rate environment,neg,train
But 13 of the 15 are on the tax line and one is in the personal line,neg,test
"We would note down the asset management fees that was driven by the Whitnell acquisition, which is also benefiting from the market environment as well",neg,train
Loan details for the fourth quarter are highlighted on Slide 6,neg,train
"Average loans increased 4% from the year ago quarter, but outstandings modestly decreased from the end of the third quarter",neg,train
Residential mortgages increased 3% from the prior quarter and that increase was primarily driven by ARM production activity,neg,train
"And then, I guess maybe hitting on the inorganic side, with the Bank Mutual deal closing February 1 and conversion maybe by kind of fall of this year",neg,train
"Let's see, Phil or Chris, was just something you could expand upon your comments and I think probably Slide 10 is the best place to start just on the sequential decline in loan yields specifically in the commercial and resi mortgage",neg,train
It sounds like that's nothing more than kind of the cumulative effect of mix shift,neg,train
"But I just want to make sure there's nothing else going on in there, number one",neg,train
"Outside of technology expense, all other expenses collectively increased only $1 million from 2016",neg,train
"In connection with the enactment of the Tax Act, the company recorded approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for a one-time bonus payments to our hourly non-commissioned employees",neg,train
I mean we will be seeing the benefit as we get into February,neg,train
"So yes, I don't think that there's a systemic issue there",neg,train
So 13 of the 15 are in the tax line,neg,train
The compensation items are in the compensation items and the other one is the combination of other things,neg,train
"On Slide 13, we summarized the annual credit quality transfer for the loan book",neg,train
"Potential problem loans, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs all decreased from 2016",neg,test
"In addition, our consumer deposits have also seen healthy growth and are driven by our affinity programs which are proven to be an effective means of capturing low cost deposit balances",neg,train
"At year end, our affinity and related accounts represented over 40% of active personal checking accounts",neg,train
We remain committed to enhancing our multi-channel banking approach in 2018,neg,test
"We expect to deploy new online and mobile solutions early this year, which provide customers with enhanced features and capabilities",neg,test
"And then, with the recovery here in oil prices what's your appetite for growing that portfolio with your improvement in asset quality as well?",neg,train
"Total net charge-offs for the year were $39 million down $26 million from 2016, full year net charge-offs to average loans decreased to 19 basis points from 33 in 2016 and our provision declined by $44 million from 2016",neg,train
Let me take a minute to walk you through our expense outlook,neg,train
"On Slide 15, we provided a build up from our 2017 actual expenses to 2018 baseline",neg,train
This combines ours and Bank Mutual's run rate expenses and adjusts for Whitnell and one-time items recorded in 2017,neg,train
"We would lay on top of that normal expense growth of approximately 1% percent, the impact of moving our colleagues minimum wage to $15",neg,train
"And then, take away from that some thing mutual savings in Q3 and a full quarter of realized cost savings in Q4 at the 45% announced savings level",neg,train
This will get you to roughly $780 annual expense or $195 million per quarter as we exit 2018,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session",neg,train
I would like to turn the call back to Philip Flynn for closing remarks,neg,test
"We are in the process of going through the market and start within the credit mark as they would like to be a modestly negative interest rate mark and it's in our math we sort of take that in consideration, but that is not an explicit accretion expectation going into this",neg,train
"So there was no material one-time items, it was just a positive and equity market background and an opportunity for folks to do a lot of year-end thinking given on different things that drove probably some of the activity and contributed",neg,train
Non-interest income is expected to be between $360 million and $370 million with improving year-over-year fee-based revenue,neg,train
Non-interest expense is expected to be approximately $820 million including $40 million of one-time restructuring costs in connection with the Bank Mutual transaction,neg,train
"In terms of looking at that as a percentage of the loan portfolio though so keeping pace with growth, the overall portfolio or could we see that picking up as a contributor?",neg,train
We expect system conversion to occur in late June to early July followed by branch and system decommissioning to be completed during Q3,neg,train
"In total, we expect to consolidate 36 branches all of which are in Wisconsin",neg,train
Our overall commercial and business lending portfolio had mixed results in 2017,neg,train
We saw a strong growth in our power and utilities and REIT businesses with both portfolios capturing market share growing customer accounts and increasing commitments year-over-year,neg,train
"However, net pay downs on the legacy oil and gas book and a contraction in mortgage warehouse lending which was impacted by increased interest rates tempered this year's activity",neg,train
Interest bearing deposit costs were up 24 basis points and we continue to see modest competitive pressure in deposit pricing within our markets,neg,train
"Taken together total loan yields increased 28 basis points, deposit costs increased 24 basis points contributing to a 2 basis point expansion in net interest margin",neg,train
Any purchase accounting accretion on Slide 16 built into any of those expectations on the margin or NII?,neg,train
"On Slide 7, average deposits grew 4% or $918 million from a year ago",neg,train
"At year-end, the percentage of network transaction deposits to total deposits decreased to 11% the lowest percentage of total deposits in five years",neg,train
"As a reminder, our margin is negatively impacted in the month Fed rate increase occurs as such the December rate increase caused our network deposits to reprice against us during Q4, while the benefit to our LIBORs based loans won't be realized until this quarter",neg,train
So it is an overall percentage of the portfolio by the time we get to year-end,neg,test
It's probably where it is today or a little lower just because of the Bank Mutual acquisition,neg,train
"On top of that, we have a number of significant projects and investments that we're undertaking this year",neg,train
"We would have done these anyway, but the effect of the Tax Act makes these things even more attractive for us",neg,train
We're going to be converting the commercial deposit platform toward the latter part of the year and in between we'll have the conversion of Bank Mutual,neg,train
So we've got a lot on our plates this year and the additional income that will come to the bottom line helps all of that,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
We're pleased with the consistent growth in our corporate and commercial specialty deposits,neg,train
Technology has allowed us to successfully service our commercial deposit customers in the way that's most convenient for them,neg,train
"For the year, over 90% of our corporate banking customers deposit activity was executed via a lock box or remote deposit",neg,train
"Later in 2018, we expect to roll out an enhanced commercial deposit platform which will support further commercial deposit growth",neg,train
So the legacy Associated bank branch network has been pretty stable now for good couple of three years,neg,train
So we did most of the heavy lifting in the past,neg,train
"With Bank Mutual of course, we are taking their 50-odd branches down by almost 2/3rds 60% and that will put us in good stead I think",neg,train
It's been a watershed year for regulatory and tax reform,neg,train
"We are pleased to receive regulatory approval for the Bank Mutual transaction this week and we're optimistic about the benefit of tax reform to our customers, our shareholders and our colleagues",neg,train
"At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Philip Flynn, President and CEO for opening remarks",neg,train
"Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Associated Banc-Corp's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
My name is Omar and I will be your operator today,neg,train
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
We will be conducting a question-and-answer session at the end of this conference,neg,train
Copies of the slides that will be referenced during today’s call are available on the company's Web site at investor,neg,train
So the resi mortgage drop was really driven by prepayments that was most of it,neg,train
"Commercial we had some interest recoveries in the third quarter, so that that drove some of that decline",neg,test
We don't think there's anything as we sit today systemic which will drive any of those yields down in fact that we should be benefiting as usual starting this quarter particularly on the commercial lines and the commercial real estate lines from the Fed increase we saw in February,neg,train
"As previously announced, we anticipate $40 million in total restructuring costs",neg,train
We expect to incur between $25 million and $30 million of those charges in the first quarter with the remainder spread over the second and third quarters,neg,train
"In Q4, we expect to achieve our target cost savings of 45% and will be operating with a new combined non-interest expense run rate of between $190 million and $195 million",neg,train
Thank you and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call,neg,test
"Joining me today are Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Hankerd, our Chief Credit Officer",neg,test
"In 2017, total non-interest income of $333 million was down $20 million as we expected reflecting lower mortgage banking activity",neg,test
Fee-based revenue grew by $8 million from the prior year; growth was largely driven by higher brokerage and asset management fees reflecting the strength of the equity markets and the acquisition of Whitnell which increased assets under management and related run rate revenue,neg,train
Just in terms of tax reform should drive better profitability for you guys,neg,train
I mean does it change your strategic thinking at all in terms of either potential investments as we go through this year,neg,train
And also just in terms of capital strategy whether maybe we see some more capital fall to those kind of those bottom buckets on your preferred uses of capital?,neg,test
"At this time, we would be conducting a question-and-answer session",neg,test
"[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Young, SunTrust Robin Humphrey",neg,test
"In 2018, we anticipate to grow our loan portfolio on average in the mid-single digits and bond over $1 billion of net new loans",neg,train
We highlight fourth quarter net interest income and margin trends on Slide 10,neg,train
The average yield on total commercial loans decreased 4 basis points to 3,neg,train
This decline was driven by lower interest recoveries and mixed effects versus Q3,neg,train
"With respect to mix, we note that shrinkage in our higher yielding general commercial loans was partially offset by growth in our REIT and power and utilities portfolios",neg,test
Total expenses for the year would also include estimated restructuring costs of $40 million which leads us to an expected total GAAP expense of approximately $820 million for 2018,neg,train
Total non-interest expense of $709 million increased less than 1% from 2016,neg,train
"And as I said, the efficiency ratio improved for the sixth consecutive year",neg,train
Technology and equipment expenses currently represent about 12% of our annual expenditures,neg,train
I hope that we provided you enough detail in the slides to be able to answer some of your questions,neg,train
"But, it's always -- please give us a call, if you have any additional questions",neg,train
"So maybe imagine that you've got a single reservation in place, is the international partners are on the platform, the Airbus aircraft are reconfigured, you didn't have the cost inefficiencies, what might this have meant? What would this potentially mean like for the first quarter here, just for perhaps some perspective?",neg,train
"When you look back at kind of the experience thus far with acquiring Virgin, I think maybe you paid a little bit more than you would've wanted to",neg,train
"The integration seems to be largely on track, maybe a little bit better",neg,train
"Can you just talk about your appetite for M&A in the future, and whether your experience with Virgin makes you more or less comfortable looking at acquiring other airlines in the future?",neg,train
"So everything now is operating within the same framework, the same mentality of how we operated Alaska in the past",neg,train
"So our goal, just to be really honest is to lead the industry in operational excellence",neg,test
But I think there's some lingering fears that the Virgin integration maybe isn't going quite to plan,neg,train
We have also included certain unaudited supplementary data labeled Combined Comparative Statistics on Page 9 of our earnings release to help investors make meaningful comparisons to the combined results of both airlines from last year's fourth quarter and full year,neg,train
"In terms of connectivity, I think we're thinking more Portland than anywhere else, Andrew, but maybe you can elaborate on that",neg,test
"We do think our low cost, our operational capability are real",neg,train
But the opportunities aren't the same as they were three or four years ago,neg,train
"And so, one of - so if you are a good steward of capital, you've got to make the right decision at the right time",neg,train
Your next question comes from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital,neg,train
"Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $367 million",neg,test
"Excluding merger related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, and a special $274 million tax benefit associated with recent tax reform legislation, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $103 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0",neg,train
"Andrew last quarter, I think articulated a desire to grow 5% to 6% in 2019",neg,train
"And so, really that change has happened in the last 90 days",neg,train
"And the genesis of the changes are the things that Brad talked about, which is the rising fuel price environment, the additional capacity that we're seeing",neg,train
"Second, we've budgeted productivity improvements in nearly every operationally every operational division",neg,train
Horizon is a great example with pilot and flight attendant productivity budgeted to be up 3 and 9 points respectively,neg,test
"For 2017, we reported adjusted net income of $823 million or $6",neg,train
"Of the growth plan for 2018, approximately 70% is flying today and Paine Field represents the bulk of the rest",neg,train
"Hunter, I don't have a crystal ball, but I - that's what we see and that's what we believe",neg,train
"And on the rest, we'll respond to what we get in the way that's best for our shareholders",neg,train
"Q4 cost came in slightly better than our final guidance, that's positive",neg,train
But we also know that our cost management practices both in the operation and in the back office can be improved,neg,train
So with the integration on track 2018 marks are returned to the basics,neg,train
And one of those is a finally tuned cost management,neg,train
"Instead, it's about productivity, a mindset of frugality, leaders knowing their cost drivers and making smart trade-offs",neg,train
"Looking forward, TRASM guidance for the first quarter is down 3",neg,test
"5%, on capacity growth of 8% and weighted competitive capacity growth of 6%",neg,train
More than 5 points in this growth comes from annualizing the new flying we launched last year,neg,train
"As Brad mentioned earlier, our network expansion is now largely complete, and our focus in 2018 is to optimize what we built in 2017",neg,train
"This will build Q2, Q4 with full cross-fleeting in effect by the beginning of 2016",neg,train
"And RASM needs to do what it needs to do, costs need to do what they need to do to get to do to get higher returns to our shareholders",neg,train
"Just wanted to touch-base on the employee side, I'm just wondering what you're doing to smooth out and just make sure that the two cultures are blending together?",neg,train
"But in terms of us talking about other M&A activity, I don't think we're going to bite on that",neg,train
"In 2018, we'll take delivery of 12 new mainline jets bringing the mainline fleet to just over 230 aircraft",neg,train
Our mainline fuel efficiency will continue to be among the best in the industry at about 80 ASMs per gallon,neg,train
"An efficient fleet is the best hedge against rising fuel prices, but it's worth noting that we also have fuel hedges with strike prices at about $62 level in place for 50% of our expected consumption in the first six months of the year",neg,train
Just a housekeeping question on this 4% growth figure for 2019 and 2020,neg,train
"I'm just trying to understand how new this actually is? I mean, you had already indicated at Investor Day that you were going to be slowing pretty significantly after 2018",neg,train
So could - whether that's the original figure? Could you give us sort of a genesis of maybe when as opposed to how your reached the new figure?,neg,train
"As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results",neg,train
Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings,neg,train
We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel,neg,train
We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release,neg,train
"And when we think about the 4% capacity growth in 2019, and we'll just focus on 2019, you originally said you were going to be up 6% to 7%",neg,train
"What did you scale back? Was it some new market growth? Was it just a function of a little bit of stage length and some gauge moving around? Did you kill off certain underperforming routes? Or are you just not going to start certain routes you maybe planned on doing? Can you talk us through to the amount - to the extent you can, what changed in the plans specifically?",neg,train
Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
I think you guys called out some pretty significant revenue underperformance at Virgin,neg,train
"And Andrew, I think you talked about the transcon markets to an earlier question, but can you guys just comment further, how's the revenue dynamic playing out core of Alaska versus core of Virgin? And do you feel you've got the right strategy in place to fix some of those deficiencies?",neg,train
"Including leases, our year end adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 51%, and 8 point improvement in the last year",neg,train
We should have on balance sheet debt down under $2,neg,train
"5 billion by the end of 2018 and we expect debt-to-cap to improve to 50%, even with a couple of points of headwind that will face with the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules and the related hit to equity",neg,train
"We started the year with, I don't know, $750 million of NOLs or something on a gross basis",neg,train
"We think we'll be through that by the end of 2019, so the 2019 tax year",neg,train
"In summary, we laid a solid foundation for our future last year and the integration will be largely complete by early this spring",neg,train
"By the end of April, will be poised to focus on full attention on the things that matter most, being close to our people, running a great operation and for serving and enhancing both our great service and our low costs and low fares",neg,train
We operate one of the best route networks in the country based in some of the best performing regional economies of the country,neg,train
I would think they are worse and do you think they can ever get back to where Alaska was pre-merger?,neg,train
The second thing we're doing is we're getting leaders out in the operation,neg,test
"And finally, we've long run this company in a balanced way to bring superior value to everyone who depends on us, including you our owners",neg,train
We have a very talented team is working hard to ensure this continues,neg,train
"And once again, I want to thank our employees for their incredible commitment to Alaska",neg,test
"And second, we got a random guide from you for the quarter",neg,train
"But the industry is starting to pull ahead again, we're starting to see actual earnings guides from airlines",neg,train
"Who knows? But just like buybacks and dividends have the additional benefit of acting somewhat as a governor on growth, you could argue that having management beholden to actual earnings guides could also limit maybe some of the riskier competitive behavior that we occasionally see out there",neg,train
And then just a follow up just on the overall merger,neg,train
"You had spoken before about just some an extra cost related to like res agents, et cetera, just explaining things that you didn't expect are those cost starting to abate now that you're getting more well known in your market?",neg,train
"But at the end of the day, we've had two years now of cost increases",neg,train
And I think we need to get back to flat to down CASM,neg,train
"The CapEx figures above should allow for growth in the 4% range of 2019 and 2020, which is still be above GDP growth",neg,train
"Free cash flow provides a convenient place to talk about the new tax loss, and the anticipated impact on cash flows",neg,train

I was just wondering if I could follow up on the operational improvement in fourth quarter and it seems like you're still kind of behind historical levels,neg,train
Just wondering what the expectation is for the improvement as you go through the year,neg,test
And maybe kind of separate that out by the issues that you've had in kind of the Northwest versus California,neg,train
"That's why Ben and I are confident that as we move into 2018 where we had time to restructure the network, get the block times right, understand how we're going to fly and going into 2019, we think this machine is really going to start to hum",neg,train
We believe we're getting through our merger at a pace that is equal to or faster than the most rapid mergers in the industry,neg,train
Some specific merger related accomplishments from the last few months are as follows,neg,train
We have co-located Alaska and Virgin America operations at 22 of 31 airports,neg,train
"Well, just to start, our people and culture are something we cherish a lot at Alaska",neg,train
And Virgin had a great - has a great culture,neg,train
"And if you remember, what we said last time, and one of the things we did first was align on the purpose of our airline, which is creating an airline people love, and then we reestablished the values of the airlines",neg,train
"In light of so many important achievements last year, I want to pause and personally thank our entire team of more than 23,000 people for their contributions in 2017, a year that I believe we'll look back on as having laid the foundation for our future growth and prosperity",neg,train
"As we look at the future, we're going to grow",neg,train
We just don't think this as an environment that argues for 7% or 8% growth,neg,train
"It argues for a lower growth number, and that's what we're going to do",neg,train
"The merger closed on December 14, 2016 or just 13 months ago",neg,train
"Today, as we expected, we have substantially all of the cost of the combined company in our results with very little of the revenue",neg,train
"And whatever approach we take, we are committed to tapping into the opportunity before us to increase up sell and ancillary revenues",neg,train
This particular opportunity would represent incremental revenue above our stated synergy targets for the merger,neg,train
We're just beginning to evaluate the full potential of up sell and will share more with you on our future calls,neg,train
While the full carriers that represent about 85% of U,neg,train
"domestic revenues have taken to adding significant capacity in our core network while we integrate, the switch to a single reservation system for all the reasons above will increase our ability to weather these challenges",neg,train
One open item that could impact our 2018 cost is a possible deal with our flight attendants,neg,train
"We're working with them now, and hope to get a deal done soon",neg,train
"If and when we reach an agreement, we'll revise our cost guidance accordingly",neg,train
"If we can get this done, we'll have 63% of our unionized workforce and 80% of the payroll that they represent under contract through the end of 2019, giving us great cost visibility",neg,train
"This was a record for us, surpassing 2016's mark by more than $175 million and represents our fourth consecutive year of operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion",neg,train
"CapEx for the year was $1 billion, resulting in $670 million of free cash flow again ex integration cost",neg,train
"(NYSE:ALK) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 11:30 AM ET",neg,train
"One of the things that Alaska has prided itself, being good stewards of capital",neg,train
"And as part of that, I think we've been a pretty contrarian management team",neg,train
There have been times when the industry has been down where we've chosen to grow aggressively,neg,train
"And then in other environments, you've got to make the right decision",neg,train
We made all aircraft delivery and interior decisions and our first Airbus airplane came out of the paint shop yesterday with new Alaska colors,neg,test
And thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call,neg,train
"On the call today are CEO, Brad Tilden, who will provide an overview of the business; our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, who will discuss our cost performance and cash flow; and Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook",neg,test
Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions,neg,train
"When do you start getting to a level of stability on RASM trends? I'm guessing it's not the second quarter, or maybe it is?",neg,train
Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"On the revenue side, we have - as Andrew described, the opportunity to unleash a whole bunch of new revenue once we get PSS behind us, starting in late April",neg,train
And we've talked about it in the context of our revenue synergy opportunity,neg,train
"So there's - you can do some math and kind of figure out what we would've had, had we pulled it forward to, say, January 1",neg,train
"But it's hard to quantify really, but it is real",neg,train
"Brandon, just on the CapEx outlook, it seems like that's changed quite a bit relative to how you guys were thinking about it before and you're going to forego some options that you're maybe thinking about taking earlier",neg,test
"So can you just talk through, I guess, what changed and what the uses of cash are going forward?",neg,train
So we got a team focused on ATC mitigation on a daily basis with our management team and with our dispatchers,neg,train
"It also has schedule implications, how we structure the schedule, when we depart, type of airplanes we put at different times of the day",neg,train
"So our goal really is to really mitigate it to the largest extent possible and to - on a network basis, get the highest operational performance",neg,train
"As we look at our business in 2018, we have work in front of us",neg,test
We plan to attack the revenue pressure by reconfiguring our Airbus fleet for greater revenue,neg,train
"By undertaking significant cross-fleeting in high volume markets, by driving continued loyalty growth, and most importantly, by tapping into segmentation and up-sell opportunities post-PSS",neg,train
The brand health and guests loyalty data associated with our growth initiatives are showing strong year-over-year trends,neg,train
"And importantly, Alaska's unaided brand awareness now exceeds Virgin America in California by 9 points",neg,train
We fully expect strong performance in these metrics will lead to greater market share and profitability,neg,train
"In addition, the volume and quality of the growth we are seeing our Mileage Plan and credit card programs system wide fuels our optimism that our efforts in 2017 laid the groundwork for strong future revenue performance",neg,train
"And then, Andrew, with respect to your remarks on the embrace of basic economy or something similar, can you elaborate a little bit further on what it's costing you today by not having it? And what could be the timing for any rollout as you move in that direction?",neg,train
"I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady",neg,train
I talked last quarter about the pressures on 2018 costs,neg,train
"The new rates with our pilots, the power by the hour deal on our 737-800 engines, and the growing mix of higher costs regional flying",neg,train
"Excluding those items, our unit cost for 2018 would be down about 1% on the 7",neg,train
"5% increase in capacity, a strong result for the underlying business",neg,train
I think what it does for us is able to provide more convenient travel for our guests directly,neg,train
"Bottom line, our unit costs will rise in 2018, but our team is committed to having a cost structure that maintains a cost advantage over the legacy carriers",neg,train
"And even though the income of 2018 budget is hardly dry, we're already thinking about 2019 and have a planning mindset that consolidated cost should be flat to down slightly in each 2019 and 2020",neg,train
"This will, of course, depend on capacity growth, it gets harder as capacity growth comes down and it will also depend somewhat on the timing of a flight attendant deal",neg,train
"That's not guidance, but it is directionally where we think we want to go",neg,train
Our history is one that is built upon adversity and has always resulted in us becoming stronger,neg,train
"And since we'll only enter a handful of new markets in the year ahead, we'll be able to fully turn our attention to optimizing our product and pricing across the newly established network",neg,train
"I guess, our team is telling us that Susan had the last question",neg,train
We expect total CapEx of 2018 to be about $1 billion,neg,train
"4 billion, which we assume - which assumed we'd exercise all options for deliveries beyond 2018",neg,train
"A lot of that cost really comes as a result of transition, whether it's transition, moving people from a Virgin flight to an Alaska flight or transition because of changes in our loyalty program as we move people from Elevate into Mileage Plan",neg,train
"And by the way, I'd like to thank our res folks and our customer service agents, because they've had to deal with the lion's share of this",neg,train
"And once we get through PSS, I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of that will have been abated",neg,train
"And then, Brendon, a quick one for you on the CASM side",neg,train
We've now operated three months without a single pilot related cancellation,neg,train
"Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for the questions",neg,train
"I guess, now that you've gone through a big part of the integration, you've been operating in California in a bigger scale for a year now, how would you rank your operations in California versus your Pacific Northwest operations?",neg,train
"Can you just repeat your question, just so I can make sure I understand it?",neg,train
We remain committed to getting to our goal of having debt-to-cap in the mid-40% range by 2020,neg,train
We're also well positioned in a rising interest rate environment as roughly 0,neg,train
"During 2017, we returned $223 million to shareholders via $148 million in dividends and $75 million in share repurchases",neg,train
"As you've seen in our press release, and as Brad mentioned, we're again increasing the dividend by 7% to $0",neg,train
We've now increased the dividends five times since we initiated in 2013,neg,train
This call will be available for future playback at www,neg,train
"I kind of feel like a kid that already opened his Christmas present and now he's asking for another one, the first one being random",neg,train
"But have you given this any thought? Once we get a little bit further through, do you think you'd play catch-up once again with the industry? Any thoughts?",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Part of doing that one, like I said is putting operational process in terms of departing airplanes always on time like we do",neg,train
"As an example of our confidence in our future, our board today announced a 7% increase in our dividend to $0",neg,train
I'd like to take a minute to frame for you where we are in the integration journey,neg,train
We wanted to continue doing this in the years ahead,neg,train
I missed the first part of your question specifically to something,neg,train
Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research,neg,train
Your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America,neg,train
On my point is not to create a new CASM metric that excludes big cost items,neg,train
But it is to underscore the hard work that our divisional leaders did through multiple budget cycles to produce the plan that recognizes our need to keep costs low,neg,train
6% and our overhead CASM declined by more than 3% in the budget,neg,train
"As you've heard, we've reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $103 million bringing - full year net income to $823 million",neg,train
"This was the third best year for us ever, and came in at a time of rapid growth, significant competitive pressure and then 18% increase in fuel prices, all while we were busy integrating two airlines",neg,train
"Of the $300 million original synergy target, we expect to realize $65 million in 2018, consistent with our prior forecast",neg,train
"More important than the synergies however is the incredible platform that we'll have to grow revenue and profit in the years ahead and create value for our owners, our customers and our employees, just as we have in the last couple of decades",neg,train
"Turning to new markets, 44 markets in operation less than one year represented approximately 10% of our total capacity and contributed the remaining 2",neg,train
5 points of the overall 4 points decline in TRASM,neg,train
"Finally, 28 of the 44 new markets launched in 2017 commenced post summer break, so many currently operated TRASM levels well below our long-term expectations",neg,train
And I want to drill into two specific points on this,neg,train
"First, promotional activity to both support these markets and grow loyalty has more than 1 point impact on the quarter",neg,train
"Our challenging on the near-term results, this is great for the long-term health of our network",neg,train
When you just stick the fourth quarter CASM performance of down 4% year-over-year following a very important competitive capacity,neg,train
"I want to start with this, since it's an environmental factor that is real and elevated at this time",neg,train
"Looking at our network, competitive capacity was up from a 1% increase in Q3 to 4% in Q4",neg,train
"Looking forward, first quarter 2018 competitive capacity is expected to increase 2 points to 6% and another 2 points in the second quarter to 8%",neg,train
Your next question comes from the Jamie Baker with JPMorgan,neg,train
"And I would just add that the California markets as a whole are up materially in load factor year over-year, new markets, inter-Cal, California de-con [ph]",neg,train
So we're excited about the demand and traffic overall that we're seeing,neg,test
"For the fourth of 2017, our on-time performance was up, more than 2 points year-over-year",neg,train
We're focused on maintaining this positive momentum as we move through 2018,neg,train
"I finally like to provide a brief update on Horizon, where we brought in Air Group veterans Gary Beck and Constance von Muehlen, and where we've made several other leadership changes",neg,train
"All right, and if I may just ask the - on the follow-up question on the targeting of flat to down CASMex in 2019 and 2020, given the slower growth, any drivers of that, that will help reach that goal?",neg,train
Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research,neg,train
"Bearing in mind what I've just shared about fourth quarter performance and the first quarter outlook, I want to spend a moment talking to our owners",neg,train
I was just reflecting this week that this is my 10th year with you on quarterly earnings calls,neg,train
"In all seriousness, what I would say is - and we did talk about that a lot",neg,train
It's the first time we guide TRASM and we plan to do this going forward,neg,train
"But we really landed on a way of thinking about it where we say, let's guide to what we can control",neg,train
So I think we're very comfortable guiding to what we control,neg,train
"And finally, with a single reservation system, we will be able to address up sell and segmentation opportunities which the legacy carriers are executing on today and that we have not been able to participate in",neg,train
There are a number of ways for us to participate,neg,test
"Basic economy is just one of those, fair families and ancillary bundles are others",neg,train
"My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today",neg,train
"At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call",neg,train
Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www,neg,train
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise,neg,train
"After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts",neg,test
"In total, we own 67 next-gen mainline and E175 jets free and clear, and expect that number to grow in 2018, including our $400 million of undrawn lines of credit, our uncapped borrowing capacity will exceed $2 billion by the end of the year",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James,neg,train
You called out some of the competitive pressures that you're seeing in California,neg,train
"And I believe last quarter, maybe it was the prior quarter, you called out California, I think you also called out maybe some pressure on the transcons",neg,train
And I just - I didn't hear that on this call,neg,train
"And I'm just - I'm wondering has the - for you, your transcon sort of situation revenue environment, has that improved or may be stabilized for you? If you could provide some color on that, that would be great, given it's a sizable part of your network",neg,train
"It needs to happen every day to work well, keeping costs low is vital to our low fare model and powers our business success",neg,test
"This is on an apples-to-apples basis, after confirming the 2017 numbers to the changes required by the new accounting rules for revenue recognition and presentation of pension expense, which are relatively small",neg,train
This information in this morning's investor update that explains these expected changes to the way our 2017 results will be restated,neg,train
And this next question is going to be a little more difficult I think,neg,train
"But then layering the synergies from a much higher earnings level, I mean, just looking at consensus EPS for 2018 back then, and obviously fuel changes and everything else",neg,test
"I'm just trying to get a sense of how big the overhangs, the cost and revenue inefficiencies are in the first quarter here, just by not having a fully integrated airlines",neg,train
"So there is a lot of things that happened after the integration, after April",neg,train
I'm just trying to get a sense of - investors are kind of having a hard time connecting the dots,neg,train
"I'm just trying to get a sense of what this potentially could mean? What this might - what it could have meant, say, here in the first quarter if the merger have been completed, say, in December?",neg,train
"Same-store TRASM, same-stores represent approximately 90% of our total ASMs and we grew capacity in these markets by 1",neg,train
"However, after factoring for stage length increases, TRASM was down about 0",neg,train
The nominal decline is being driven by a subset of markets as pockets of industry pricing and capacity pressure remain in California,neg,train
Most of our same-store markets continue to show either flat or positive TRASM,neg,train
We will share $118 million in incentive pay tomorrow as annual bonuses are paid out,neg,test
This is the 9th consecutive year in which we proudly share profits with our employees at levels that have averaged of about one month of additional pay per employee per year,neg,train
And I'll just say we haven't decided on what this would look like for us,neg,train
"And it could be something that's like basic, we tend We tend to not do me-toos of sort of the network carriers",neg,train
"I was going to ask a unit-revenue related question on trends, with a peer group seeing up unit revenue and you guys still seeing down unit revenue",neg,train
But it seems like you're starting to address that - this difference,neg,train
"Yeah, it's - we haven't quantified it specifically, but what I will say is, we made the comment in the prepared remarks that we do really have all of the costs of the integrated company without all of the revenues",neg,train
"Is it $50 million? No, is it more than $5 million? Sure",neg,train
"If I had just kind of put a number on it, I might say that there $10 million than the first four months of the year of cost friction, if you will, that will dissipate as the year goes on",neg,train
"With all the growth, we've done in last couple of years, we do have the utility that we wanted to get into California",neg,train
"We've got core royal customer basis, economic models that are working very, very well",neg,train
"The only thing I can say to that, because I actually don't know the answer to your question is that we are focused on delivering adequate returns to our shareholders",neg,train
So what I would say is that it's hard to say what was then versus what was now,neg,train
"As Brandon will share in a moment, we expect capital expending to decline in 2019 and 2020, and free cash flow to increase consistent with the lower capacity growth",neg,train
"Can you just comment on the Hawaiian market, and just what you're seeing there right now?",neg,train
"And as I shared earlier too, we're working on all of our schedules right now",neg,train
"We've got better seasonality coming up in the second half, so that's what we're focused on",neg,test
And we have a steady cadence of communication and getting out with folks,neg,train
"So as we look at 2019 and 2020, we're going to grow considerably",neg,train
"That's enough to hang onto our current market position and grow a little bit, but it's not at the same level",neg,train
"I was looking back last night, our growth over the last 5 years without Virgin America has been 7%, 7%, 10%, 10% and 7% or something like that",neg,train
And if you look at the fuel prices are up $20 a barrel in just the last 6 months,neg,train
"And so, over the last 90 days as I said, as we thought about 2018, 2019 and 2020, we really wanted to dial it back",neg,train
"It's still on a big base and it's still higher than GDP, but it is the right level for us going forward",neg,train
"The acquisition of Virgin America, which only closed 13 months ago, is arguably the single-largest impact to our business outside of the great recession over these past 10 years",neg,train
And the reason I raise this is we're only three months away from a single reservation system,neg,train
"While some will insist on comparing our current revenue performance to carriers who achieved this single reservation system anywhere from two to eight years ago, the reality is, we are about to unlock the critical levers we need to generate revenues required to continue delivering on returns to our shareholders",neg,train
"This upside is obviously not reflected in current results, but it will be reflected in future results",neg,train
"And, Dan, I'll let Shane talk to you more about that",neg,train
"Transcon, we do have a lot of transcon in California",neg,train
"What I - and we don't like to talk about regions, but what I will tell you is load factors are actually up and traffic is extremely strong",neg,train
I think that what I've been looking at on a network basis is that our seasonality with the merger with Virgin America has actually got worse in the first quarter and in the September/October months and stronger in the summer peak periods,neg,train
"E-commerce resources will free up to ensure that the significant loyalty growth we've achieved since acquisition will continue and that we capitalize on a single guest experience, whether via digital channels at the airport or in the air, and this will drive incremental revenue over the long term",neg,train
"Joe, that is a great question that I don't think we're going to answer",neg,train
"But I will just say, the Virgin experience has been a good one",neg,train
We've - the company has got an $8 billion platform today,neg,train
"If you look at the way Alaska is promoting itself, I think it's activated something inside us in terms of getting into California, growing loyalty",neg,test
"What you've heard me share on the call, Brandon, is that we view our network in really two pieces",neg,train
"There are same-store sales, which includes Californian and the rest of our network that's been operating for a year and getting that improved, and then our new markets and getting those improved",neg,test
"Yeah, I think that Andrew mentioned segmentation, obviously, basic of sort of where everybody else has gone",neg,train
"Andrew just mentioned, we think it's north of $100 million once it's fully out and running and sort of optimized, which that would take some time",neg,train
"I would just say, other airlines, I think, it took a year or more to get to market and sort of fully roll it out to every, their network",neg,train
I think some of them are still expanding it now into international,neg,test
"And then second, we are seeing improvement in the performance of our new market, while it's too early to call in on the most recent additions to our schedule",neg,train
Markets that have operated at least six months already profitable and are tracking ahead of our initial expectations,neg,train
"These results tell me that our service, product and low fare offerings are resonating with guests, and gives us confidence that our newest routes will continue to mature over the course of 2018",neg,train
Just one follow-up really to your question and to Savi's,neg,test
"We acquired - with the Virgin America acquisition we walked into 2017, inheriting a network with block hours, totally separate than we planned for",neg,test
And it wasn't until late in this year where we're able to push through block changes and changes to the operations to start to stabilize it,neg,train
But we have been in that market 10 years now,neg,train
We've got it finally tuned and we're very happy with how we're running and operating that today,neg,train
"Can you just walk us through when we should start to see a lot of stability in your RASM, and then, I'm guessing 2Q might be tough, just given comparison to the competitive capacity",neg,train
Are you trying to get RASM up sort of like Southwest is describing? Just how are you thinking about it?,neg,train
"We've rapidly built out a route network, adding 44 new routes on top of the 38 we acquired with Virgin America",neg,test
We've grown both loyalty members and credit-card holders far in excess of our passenger growth,neg,train
"We converted to a single loyalty program for customers, and single HR finance and payroll systems in the back of the house",neg,train
We're fully aware of sort of the directionality of the industry and us,neg,train
And I think we are interested in our sort of absolute revenue performance and what sort of revenue production this company needs to produce the returns we want,neg,train
"And that's what we're committed to figuring out, how to go get in the next several quarters",neg,train
"Now, we're talking about a 6-hour handle with a lower tax rate",neg,train
"And before I turn the call over to Andrew, I do want to call out the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that will be effective for Q1 of 2018",neg,train
"Big picture airlines like ours that have used to incremental cost method for miles earned through travel, will now have to defer a portion of their related flight revenue instead",neg,train
"It's important to emphasize that although there will be an impact on reported revenues, it has nothing to do with pricing or cash flows",neg,train
We've provided more information in our investor update to help investors understand the impact on both revenues and costs,neg,train
"As I mentioned earlier, we do face a step function increase in cost, which Brandon will detail for you in a moment",neg,test
But I think Paine is roughly 30 miles from Sea-Tac,neg,train
"But for those who live in Seattle, they know the getting from Snohomish County airport to Seattle is very, very difficult",neg,train
"I think, Andrew, you'll correct me, but I think it's something like 20% or even more, 22%, 23% of our customers that flying out of Sea-Tac might prefer Paine as an option for them",neg,train
"So you talked about $225 million of synergies originally with this deal, and $175 million of it was on the revenue side",neg,train
So to look at this commentary about CASMex flat to down in 2019 and 2020,neg,train
"And given that 1 point of RASM is only about $70 million, I guess, that implies that we could be sort of leaving 2018 given the deceleration in capacity, on a pretty strong trajectory on RASM if you are, in fact, capturing majority of those synergies on the revenue side, as you laid out in the presentation",neg,test
Brandon Pedersen - Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
Or more the cost side of things than the cost target,neg,train
"On the regional side, we expect - we're schedule to take delivery of 25 E175s between Horizon, and our CPA arrangement with SkyWest",neg,train
"We expect to retire 13 Q400s bringing the regional fleet to 95 units at the end of 2018, of which 61% will be modern, comfortable and versatile E175s",neg,train
"Though we rank second in operational performance last year, our on-time performance at the Air Group level was down about 5 points compared to 2016",neg,train
"While we struggle with external factors like challenging winter weather in the first quarter and ATC delays, we have room for improvement",neg,train
We expect Q1 CASMex to increase 6% three things drive the increase,neg,train
"First, wages and benefits are higher, with much of that due to the increase in mainline pilot rates",neg,train
"And third, we expect to record higher incentive pay expense, particularly for our operational rewards program, which paid almost nothing in Q1 of last year given our operational challenges",neg,train
"Of course, we have to hit those operational targets to earn those rewards",neg,train
"So, Savi, you're asking about our capital spending and capacity growth in 2019 and 2020?",neg,train
"So I would say that California, we feel very good about",neg,train
"As I shared in my prepared remarks, a lot of the places where we're feeling weakness and pressure, I should say, we have a lot of things coming that we feel are going to significantly strengthen our position",neg,train

"On the labor front, while we still have work to do, at this point, we have single joint collective bargaining agreements with our pilots and our customer service and reservation agents",neg,train
And we believe we're closed with both our flight attendants and our maintenance technicians,neg,train
"Yeah, I mean, just to get back on to the third quarter call, I mean, I can't understate enough how inheriting a network on December 17 that has already been scheduled and planned, not done under Ben's operational parameters, not under our normal parameters has been very, very challenging for us",neg,train
"As we shared with you on our third quarter call, our earnings are under some pressure as we deal with some step-function cost increases, as well as significant new competitive capacity in markets where we fly",neg,train
"As we'll talk about on this call, we are optimistic about our future, as we work our way through these issues as we complete the majority of the integration activity by early this spring and as we begin capturing the advantages of the merger",neg,test
And we believe that Alaska has real and durable competitive advantage,neg,train
"We have this with our operational processes and capability, with the fantastic service our people provide to our guests, with the very clear cost advantage that's masked with the history of offering low fares, with our growing route network, and most importantly, with the way we work with our employees to bring all of this together",neg,train
We've always talked for the last seven or eight or nine years about growing in the 4% to 8% range as Brad alluded to earlier,neg,test
"On the cost side, our relative cost advantage has been a hallmark of our business for years",neg,test
"And is one of our greatest assets, second only to our people",neg,train
We will sustain this advantage by focusing on low overhead and industry-leading productivity,neg,train
"In short, we'll benefit significantly a nice tailwind at a time of rising fuel prices and competitive pressure",neg,train
Our book effective rate for 2018 should be about 24,neg,train
"5%, but our cash effective rate should be between 10% and 15% after consideration of our acquired NOLs",neg,train
Andrew Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer,neg,test
"Hey, Brandon, you talked about your cash tax rate being 10% to 15% after consideration of our acquired NOLs",neg,train
Do you have - are you going to be able to use - fully utilize the NOLs that you got as a result of the Virgin acquisition?,neg,test
As we've reported total revenues in 2017 rose 6% to $7,neg,train
Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 6% to approximately $2 billion on 10% growth,neg,train
"There are specific drivers behind our current revenue performance, and it's important to look at each one to appreciate that our fundamentals are sound, and significant opportunities lie ahead for improved revenue performance",neg,test
"So, I don't know if Andrew or Brad want to answer this question, but what's the thought behind the growth at Paine Field? And looking at the roots that you're adding, I suppose, you're not expecting connecting traffic there",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS,neg,train
"So, absolutely there is a role for new CELMoDs in multiple myeloma",neg,train
"So there is an absolute role for new CELMoDs, again as single agents, but also a combination place",neg,train
"In terms of the refractory and I think you’re probably referring to lymphoma, but it sounds that refractory population",neg,train
If you think about diffuse large B-cell lymphoma today in that relapse refractory setting,neg,train
That’s why we feel that JCAR017 offers a very disruptive approach to that treatment,neg,test
We turn the disease from an acute situation to chronocity,neg,train
"In terms of our pipeline compounds, the luspatercept Phase 3 programs in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia will read out later this year as well the Phase 3 results for CC-486 in AML",neg,train
We are making excellent progress with the advancement and expansion of our pipeline programs,neg,train
"Starting with CAR T, bb2121 was granted breakthrough designation in the U",neg,train
And we also initiated the pivotal KarMMa trial in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma,neg,train
It sounds like you now have JCAR017 which is helping the U,neg,train
S refractory DLBCL and move up that line and then you have your BCMA suite,neg,train
How big will that market be do you think in 10 years? Thanks,neg,test
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore,neg,train
"Working with our partner bluebird bioscience is to bring bb2121 to the myeloma market remains a top corporate priority and with JCAR017 for relapsed lymphoma, Celgene is poised to launch two CAR T therapies for blood cancers in the next three years",neg,train
All these achievements set up Celgene for a positive growth profile for the next decade,neg,test
2017 was a strong year for Celgene with top line growth and exceptional operating performance,neg,train
Year-over-year product sales and EPS growth continue to be industry-leading,neg,train
"During this past year, we gained regulatory approval for REVLIMID maintenance in both the U",neg,train
"2017 was a very good year for Celgene I&I, highlighted in Q4 by strong net sales growth and progress against our strategic priorities",neg,train
"OTEZLA has now established a solid foundation in a pre-biologic setting, resulting in a substantial increase in utilization in both the U",neg,train
The base case continues to be that we'd have a class label with monitoring,neg,train
"Clearly, from the data we’ve a highly differentiated compound both in terms of efficacy, safety, and tolerability",neg,train
"In terms of ex-US OTEZLA sales, as I mentioned earlier, the core markets, the U",neg,train
", Germany, France, and Japan are really at the early stage of the launch",neg,train
The addition of fedratinib will build a leadership position for Celgene in myelofibrosis,neg,test
"Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; our Global Head of our Hematology/Oncology franchise, Nadim Ahmed; Terrie Curran, Global Head of our Inflammation and Immunology franchise; and Scott Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer",neg,test
"Also available for the Q&A portion of the call are Bob Hugin, our Executive Chairman; Jonathan Biller, who heads up our Tax and Treasury Group; Jay Backstrom, our Chief Medical Officer; and Rupert Vessey, Global Head of our Research and Early Development Group",neg,train
We are also very excited about our agreement with Juno Therapeutics announced earlier this week,neg,train
With expansion of global rights to JCAR017 and the U,neg,train
S approval expected in 2019 for relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,neg,train
"In summary, the hematology and oncology franchise delivered a strong quarter",neg,train
We continue to deliver robust sales growth and made significant progress with our pipeline,neg,train
"The promise of our pipeline is delivering with near-term Phase 3 data readouts for luspatercept in low-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia, as well as CC-486 in AML",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse,neg,train
", can you talk about some of the marketing works that you’ve been doing with OTEZLA, maybe in psoriasis and psoriatic and then also as far as the OTEZLA enrollment goes, during a further color you can give us there, kind of about the progress that you’re making so far",neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company,neg,train
There's a large unmet need in myelofibrosis with only one agent currently approved,neg,train
Fedratinib is a highly selective JAK2 inhibitor with potential clinical utility in patients who are resistant or intolerant to REVLIMID,neg,train
We are really encouraged with both the 12-week data as well as the long-term data across -- the totality of the data really enables us to make a decision to move forward,neg,train
It was really very positive and very compelling across all endpoints,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays,neg,train

"Just starting with our partnership with bluebird bio as we've mentioned now several times this week and today, it is a very, very important partnership",neg,train
"We think as the Nadim said in his prepared remarks that 2121 is a disruptive technology and therapy for patients, particularly with relapsed myeloma",neg,train
I’m going to turn the rest of the description over to Scott,neg,train
The next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets,neg,train
"Just looking at the trial design, you’ve a 12-week primary endpoint, you have a 52-week follow-up, just trying to -- I was hoping you could speak to what we should expect from at the time the data release",neg,train
"And the decision to move into Phase 3 trials, is purely based on the week 12 data or were you able to look at the 52 follow-up in these patients, especially with the endoscopy results?",neg,train
"Morgan Conference earlier this year, we presented our full-year 2018 financial guidance",neg,train
"As a reminder, we expect total revenue to increase 12% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS to grow 18%",neg,train
This guidance does not include the expected dilutive impact of adjusted EPS from our recent announced acquisition of Juno Therapeutics,neg,train
"For the full-year 2017, our operating margin increased 300 basis points to 58%",neg,train
We ended the year with approximately $12 billion in cash and marketable securities,neg,train
"As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook, in addition to regulatory and product development plans",neg,train
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted,neg,train
A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q on file with the SEC,neg,test
"These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them",neg,train
Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release,neg,train
Thanks for taking the question and thanks for fitting me in,neg,train
"Peter, I was just hoping, you’ve obviously talked about missing these dynamics year-over-year where first quarter was impacted",neg,train
"You highlighted ABRAXANE, OTEZLA, which we saw last year and donut hole",neg,train
"Can you just sort of dimensionalize for us versus what we saw last year which I think some of the downward trends maybe surprising for people, just how you’re --what you’re seeing shape up now through January and how you’re expecting gross to net impacts in the first quarter? Thanks",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference",neg,train
"Fourth quarter operating earnings per share was $2, a 24% year-over-year increase",neg,train
Again this strong bottom-line performance was driven by operating income,neg,train
Good morning and welcome to the Celgene Investor and Analyst Conference Call,neg,train
I'd like to remind you this call is being recorded,neg,train
So as you know we have --- we gave a high and low end of the range for 2020 revenue and some of the moving parts in there do include some of the additional indications for REVLIMID,neg,train
So at this point really there is no change in our thinking at all,neg,train
"Obviously, we took the opportunity to refine them in the fall and we feel very good about them right now",neg,test
"And so, that's really what our focus has been on that",neg,train
"On the Ozanimod question, I will pass it over to Terrie",neg,train
Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Terrie,neg,train
"Regarding the strategic potential for the Juno deal and your strategy in cell therapy, maybe you can just talk about what type of synergies you can derive as you have a partnership with bluebird",neg,train
"Can you just maybe clarify or talk about how you could lever to those two and whether there's opportunities, whether that's commercially, whether that's cost-saving, whether that's manufacturing, maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about those two partnerships and one of them being an acquisition",neg,train
"I mean, in the SPMS specification, there has been a large number of failures",neg,train
"I mean, that has given the team an opportunity to really do some deep analysis and take a look at the trial design, and particularly the patient types and the power of the studies have influenced the outcome of those trial",neg,train
So taking that into account the team has been able to design trials that are powered over a length of time with particular patient type that will hopefully give us positive outcome,neg,train
"We are still in discussion with authorities, so you have to communicate the actual trial design, and we're continuing to review additional neurological indications for Ozanimod",neg,train
"Now as we began 2018, we do want to remind you that in Q1 we expect to see the customary P&L impact of our ACA donut hole payments primarily for REVLIMID and POMALYST",neg,train
The softer seasonality impacts of ABRAXANE as we've seen in prior years and the normal beginning of year seasonality in psoriasis and OTEZLA as we discussed before,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
We're very pleased with the calibrating experience of the talent we’ve been able to attract and we remain on track for launch readiness by Q4 this year,neg,train
2017 was a year of excellent progress and strong growth for the I&I franchise,neg,train
"In the year ahead, we are set to capitalize on several upcoming growth drivers, activating broader utilization in psoriasis, more convenient dosing, as well as expansion into new disease areas like Behcet's and ulcerative colitis",neg,train
"So for the first question with respect to the CNS in the neurotox across JCAR017, I think we've been able to see over time that the profile has been reasonably consistent as we see across",neg,train
I think the effort on JCAR017 and understanding that has been quite good,neg,train
So really haven't seen any major changes with -- from first -- the subsequent batches or patients being treated,neg,train
"So, I had maybe one for Terrie and one for Nadim or Mark",neg,train
"For Terrie, Terrie could you just outline a little bit for us how you’re thinking about or maybe this more a Peter question, BD within neurology, specifically which areas of neurology would you guys be interested in going down? And then the -- and then for Nadim or Mark, can you confirm that you're not de-prioritizing the BCMA that you got from Juno please? Thank you",neg,test
I'd like to start today's call by thanking my colleagues for delivering another quarter and another year of excellent operating results and strategic progress,neg,train
We learned a lot last year and begin 2018 better for the experience and more committed than ever to achieving our ambitious goals,neg,train
The hematology and oncology franchise delivered a strong fourth quarter with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and for the full-year 2017 $11,neg,train
"Yes, let's go then -- go to the next caller please?",neg,train
"Turning to Ozanimod, we are highly encouraged by the results we’ve seen today in both SUNBEAM and RADIANCE pivotal trials for RMS",neg,train
"Taking to fully maximize the Ozanimod opportunity in MS, we plan to initiate a pivotal program in secondary progressive MS",neg,train
This represents an important lifecycle opportunity characterized by high unmet medical need,neg,test
"For OTEZLA, we will be submitting an sNDA for Behçet's disease, finalizing enrollment in the pivotal scalp psoriasis study and initiating a pivotal trial in UC",neg,train
"We plan to develop JCAR017 in second line and third line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as CLL, yielding a global peak revenue estimate of approximately $3 billion",neg,train
"Fedratinib complements our ongoing myelofibrosis program, which includes key molecules such as luspatercept, and we've already seen encouraging preclinical activity with fedratinib in combination with multiple molecules in the Celgene early pipeline",neg,train
OTEZLA continues lead in both new-to-brand and overall pre-biologic market share,neg,test
"Yes, we’re really excited with the data that we saw in Phase 2 for OTEZLA",neg,train
"I mean, within this disease area, there's really a high unmet need with patients that are really quite sick and being treated with CNS",neg,train
It's an RO compound with a very compelling safety profile,neg,train
"In terms of the positioning versus Ozanimod, the two trials really look to different patient population",neg,train
"With OTEZLA, we look to naive patient population whereas Ozanimod, the patients were largely treated with CNS",neg,train
"So wait to see as the data emerges and how we position the two, but very excited to have two -- potentially two efficacious RO compounds to treat UC",neg,train
"Just to follow-up on Mark, bb2121, one of the really critical programs",neg,test
"There have been just from the investments we made in New Jersey manufacturing facilities, we’ve dosed now over 40 patients with product here made in New Jersey for bb2121",neg,train
There was a partnership that existed before this deal with Juno and with bluebird,neg,train
"The partnership has changed in structure, but there were firewalls in place and the fundamental synergies that existed in areas that we couldn't discuss still remain the same post-acquisition",neg,train
"So on the first point, I think, we believe because a significant market both in the post ruxolitinib failure setting and also in the segment that’s either intolerant too or has underlying thrombocytopenia such that they can't receive ruxolitinib",neg,train
So we’re going for both of those segments in terms of how we’re thinking about the actual clinical utility of fedratinib,neg,test
So luspatercept for example have the opportunity to attack with the anemic components of the disease,neg,train
"So we’re very, very excited about the opportunity for fedratinib as a monotherapy, but also as a combination therapy to address this disease",neg,train
"In terms of your second point, we already as you know have a global myeloid footprint",neg,train
So we see fedratinib as an easy plug and play situation for us across the world in our heartland of hematology,neg,test
JCAR017 together with BGB-A317 and fedratinib represent three late stage products added to the pipeline in the last nine months,neg,train
"These products together with Ozanimod, luspatercept, and others could yield over $16 billion in incremental peak revenue through 2030",neg,train
"So, yes, I’m going to actually tag team with my -- with Jonathan Biller, who is here with me, who heads our Tax and Treasury working",neg,train
He actually was as you know really our point person on a lot of the tax reform activity and which in some way he is actually while we just on the Juno transaction we’ve also just had tax reform which in a sense opens our capacity a bit and quite frankly has -- while it had an impact in Q4 on the GAAP basis,neg,train
It's really a favorable thing for companies like ours that are U,neg,train
"So this is something we worked hard on for -- I want to say 5, 6, 7 years, Jonathan",neg,train
As you saw -- I will just start and I will pass to Jonathan little bit,neg,train
"As you saw last year, we we're very selective about when the timing of when we're doing share repurchase during the first few quarters we didn't buy a lot with the volatility we saw in the fourth quarter, we actually stepped up our purchase activity quite a bit",neg,train
"And yet while that was in a sense on a full-year basis landed us above where we expect it to be anyway, that was pretty much in line -- in our final share count and it has pretty much which we’re aiming for to the average -- weighted average share count for the year is about what we had in our plan",neg,train
"It was great, because on a weighted average basis we bought our shares at a much lower price and that was probably good planning",neg,train
"But in many ways that's in a sense part of the capacity and the thinking of the company all along, but really in no ways that hold us back from doing strategic investments for our future",neg,train
"That said, people sometimes ask you hey, how do you think about capacity? What could you do and how does that evolve over time and if I could I would just like to ask Jonathan to just make a few comments in that regard in terms of how we look at it and how that evolves over time",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall with full-year 2017 net sales of approximately $1 billion with 2% year-over-year growth,neg,train
And we look forward to data readouts later in 2018 for the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial as well as the pivotal I/O ABRAXANE-elotuzumab combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer,neg,train
"Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  9:00 AM ET",neg,test
The Juno acquisition probably will give you more like mid-term to a long-term growth,neg,train
"If I do my math right, Peter, I think you purchased about $3 billion in fourth quarter",neg,train
Is that more opportunistic given the stock price or is that going to be kind of like the new run rate for 2018 as well? You’re going to consider a pretty significant share buyback in this year?,neg,train
"You'll hear much more about our fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 performance from Peter, Nadim, Terrie, and Scott later during the call",neg,train
"Internationally, we noted an increasing contribution from key markets where a differentiated access position has been secured",neg,train
"In Japan, OTEZLA has already captured 15% market share after only 10 months on the market",neg,train
"Similarly in France, OTEZLA is surpassing competitive benchmarks in its first full-year on the market",neg,train
"On Ozanimod and MS, as you process the data and interact around the submissions, just wondering your latest views on the phase case for potential monitoring requirements there in MS? And then, OTEZLA ex-US",neg,train
", just wondering if there's any opportunity for an inflection in growth in its existing indications or should we be looking for more of a steady climb throughout the course of this year? Thanks",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho,neg,train
2017 was the second year in a row that at least eight IND CTAs were filed and our global clinical development teams advanced 14 pivotal trials across 13 indications including seven new agents,neg,train
"Thanks, Liz, and welcome, everyone to our fourth quarter and yearend earnings conference call",neg,train
"The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate Web site at www",neg,train
", POMALYST/IMNOVID revenue was stable, whereas growth and volume was up 15% year-on-year",neg,train
The triplet option of PVd will be an important future driver and we expect the results of the optimism trial in the first half of this year,neg,train
With Ozanimod we presented the positive results from both Phase 3 studies in relapsing MS and submitted the U,neg,train
"We also advanced development of our portfolio of novel oral therapies for the treatment of IBD, initiating Phase 3 development of Ozanimod in Crohn's disease and preparing to initiate the pivotal program for OTEZLA in ulcerative colitis",neg,train
POMALYST/IMNOVID net sales continued to grow with 17% year-over-year growth,neg,train
", POMALYST net sales grew 29% year-over-year driven by duration and share gains",neg,train
We continue to see a strong increase in demand since the U,neg,train
"S approval of the triplet regimen, POMALYST in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone for relapsed refractory myeloma",neg,test
"Just as with REVLIMID, we expect to see additional POMALYST share and duration gains through the use of triplet regimens",neg,train
"Thanks for taking the question, especially ahead of Yatin's question",neg,train
"We took note of the Phase 2 OTEZLA, UC abstract, that’s -- I guess, now out and available on the ECCO Web site",neg,test
"Maybe you guys could just talk about how -- perhaps you can give the overall thoughts on the data, but more specifically how this drug differentiates itself for might be position relative to Ozanimod obviously having two assets in the series, good thing, but are there patient populations you think one might be better suited for use in? Thank you",neg,train
"Beyond multiple myeloma, we await the results of our R-squared trials augment and robust in 2018 in lymphoma",neg,train
We also expect Phase 3 data readout for ongoing studies utilizing REVLIMID-based triplet regimens in the front-line setting throughout 2018,neg,train
"Thanks for the question Alethia, I think overall within really pleased with the momentum of the U",neg,train
If you look at some of the underlying kind of key driver,neg,train
It's really kind of activate that pre-biologic post topical segment and there is 50% of psoriasis patients that diagnosed were actually untreated and we really say that’s a significant opportunity for OTEZLA both in the U,neg,train
"In terms of the Q1 dynamics, while we see that demand continuing as Peter mentioned in his comments, we do see some kind of seasonality in Q1 as well as a minor impact of GTM as we continue to contract in the U",neg,train
"As a reminder, we entered into a number of significant contracts in '17, we’re entering '18, they’re really solid position with 80% of commercial lives having biologic step free access to OTEZLA",neg,train
"So again that’s really strategic and important for OTEZLA, because that’s where we want to position in that pre-biologic post topical segment",neg,train
", we had really the second full launch in some of the core markets and performing exceptionally well in countries like Japan as well as France where we’ve a very broad reimbursement and access position",neg,train
"To answer your second question, regarding UC and its enrollment we do see that the UC enrollment for Ozanimod has accelerated this year and we expect to complain enrollment of that trial by year end, so that’s on track",neg,train
Let me take these -- first on the BD philosophy,neg,train
"Look, as I said earlier we don’t necessarily like zero in on short-term versus medium term",neg,train
"I mean, obviously if we can buy a commercial asset or a Phase 3 asset that's great",neg,train
We are not trying to plug any holes kind of the next few years at all,neg,train
We are in great shape in terms of our growth potential and the momentum we have,neg,train
So we like to see high potential with a lot of optionality that has long IT and very strong science behind it,neg,train
"So, I don't know that we sit around saying let's plug the hole here and there, we don’t really think that way",neg,train
"Relative to the share repurchase in the fourth quarter, you're right",neg,train
9 billion or close to $4 billion and that's not really out of line with what we’ve done in past years,neg,train
"Actually that’s a great question, because as I mentioned, if you just do the math for this year and we indicated on the call earlier this week, that if you just do the math and you assume some level of financing, it's in the neighborhood of $0",neg,train
"50 diluted this year, which obviously will take our operating margin down little bit versus our guidance for '18",neg,train
"We are going to update that when we close, because it really is sensitive too",neg,train
So those will be the things to refine our final outlook for this year,neg,train
"So it will cause the margin to step back a smidge in the '18 timeframe, but then I think you'll see us kind of growing right back again with the continued leverage, while its -- we’re very excited about it",neg,train
In the next couple of years it's actually a very small element in our overall P&L,neg,train
So we'd be going right back and we probably expect to still be getting close to 60% by 2020,neg,train
"So it's a great question is that while there will be a little bit of a step back, we’re going to be growing right again as we go into 2019 on a margin basis and into 2020",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Yatin Suneja with SunTrust,neg,train
"I will take the second part of your question, which was CC-122",neg,train
"Reminder, we continue to look at CC-220 in multiple myeloma and our new CELMoD CC-92480",neg,train
But 122 is being targeted for lymphoma for further development,neg,train
We also look forward to future growth from the development of new indications including the Behçet's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as a once-daily formulation,neg,train
"In 2017, OTEZLA demonstrated strong TRx growth in the U",neg,train
So one is a randomized Phase 3 study in the front-line setting,neg,train
"There is a Phase 2 study in that kind of second line plus setting and so I think we’re going to pull the NDA submission together and then what the actual label will be -- with the result of discussions with the agency, Adnan",neg,train
"And then in terms of your question around the revenue, the $1 billion plus is based on a global revenue forecast",neg,train
"Obviously, I see you moving OTEZLA into Phase 3 study and mild to moderate psoriasis",neg,train
"From your work, how do you think about the fair challenges and receptiveness from dermatologists to moving that trigger point earlier and starting a systemic agent and to what extent was this baked in when you made your concessions on pricing for better positioning earlier this year -- earlier or last year? Thank you",neg,train
"As we enter 2018, OTEZLA is poised to serve the growth",neg,train
It's now estimated that approximately 80% of commercial lives have biologic step free access,neg,train
In Q1 we expect the normal seasonality that has impacted the psoriasis market in addition to a modest increase in GTN that we anticipate with stabilize throughout the year and be offset by very strong demand,neg,train
"Rupert Vessey - President, Research and Early Development at Celgene",neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs,neg,train
And our last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question",neg,train
"I guess, I wanted to follow up on the fedratinib question and based on the data that’s been generated to date you see this product as better suited to take share and that 20% of patients in the second line, that’s failed Jakafi or the 20% of my patients that aren't really qualified given the low platelets or its really intensive equally support between the two",neg,train
And then as you prepare for the submission of potential launch of this drug,neg,train
To what extend will you be able to leverage your existing sales force to market it or you need to augment marketing organization to some degree? Thanks,neg,train
I will hand all kind of how we are thinking about lymphoma and then Pete can talk a little bit about the revenue beyond 2020,neg,train
So our view and I think this is part of what we talked about JCAR017,neg,train
So we have a long-term view of lymphoma where JCAR017 form the anchor molecule,neg,train
"In terms of our 2020 guidance, I’m going to turn that back over to Peter",neg,test
"In 2017, greater than half a million patients were prescribed at least one of our therapies and we look to continue to expand their impact on human health in 2018 beyond",neg,train
"In Q4 we saw strong commercial performance from our inline portfolio, particularly REVLIMID and OTEZLA",neg,train
We’ve advanced key pipeline assets and importantly expanded patient access to our medications worldwide,neg,train
"Focusing on execution, the NDA for Ozanimod and RMS was submitted on the heels of two positive global Phase 3 studies",neg,train
We are currently building out a strong neuro inflammation team to execute launches and unlock the value of this important product,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Adnan Butt with Guggenheim Securities,neg,train
Currently a significant segment of patients approximately 40% are not eligible to receive ruxolitinib due to progression on treatment or low platelet counts,neg,train
These patients would be available immediately at launch for treatment with fedratinib,neg,train
We believe fedratinib represents a significant opportunity for patients and has the potential to be a $1 billion blockbuster for Celgene,neg,train
"With our early pipeline, we are advancing our newest CELMoD CC-92480 with the Phase 1 trial initiated in relapsed refractory myeloma",neg,train
"We are also initiating a Phase 1 study for CC-93269, our biospecific antibody targeting BCMA",neg,train
"Strategically we're building our capabilities and business model to ensure operational excellence, continuously grow and strengthen our financial flexibility, and to accelerate the discovery, development and introduction of new medicines with clear and compelling value proposition",neg,test
We believe that this strategy ultimately creates the most value for shareholders and the patients we seek to serve,neg,train
"Peter, just like to ask a question about the outlook for the Juno acquisition",neg,train
"I know you haven't sort of closed the acquisition or formally given any guidance, but clearly initially at least the CAR T programs you’re going to have the inferior margin profile and you’re going to take on a significant amount of overhead with that acquisition",neg,train
"So just wondering if you could give us a sense of do you think that the 58% operating margin performance that you achieved in 2017 is achievable again in the future after you incorporate Juno and complete the acquisition? And if so, how long that might take to be restored? Thanks",neg,train
We recently secured reimbursement in Spain and we expect access to additional markets throughout 2018,neg,train
"In terms of future potential growth drivers, we plan to submit an sNDA for RVd for frontline multiple myeloma in the U",neg,train
"I'd now like to turn the call over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene",neg,train
REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID demonstrated robust growth through increases in both market share and duration,neg,train
"We expect several key Phase 3 data readouts in 2018 for our in-line brands, including REVLIMID in lymphoma, POMALYST in second line plus myeloma and ABRAXANE in adjuvant pancreatic cancer",neg,train
"The first one is how critical is REVLIMID broadly in lymphoma to the 2020 guidance or the long-term picture? It just seems to me that we had JCAR017, you have better strategies in lymphoma, which actually diversify REVLIMID",neg,train
"And the second question just on I&I, the Ozanimod study in SPMS, it's new tough indication now and I think GILENYA hasn’t had -- hasn't -- didn’t have much success in PPMS, which is somewhat related",neg,train
So just curious how you guys are thinking about the study vis-à-vis patient selection,neg,train
And are there other opportunities that you see in neurology for Ozanimod? Thank you,neg,train
60% of patients that are diagnosed with psoriasis are untreated,neg,train
So there is an opportunity there for a compound like OTEZLA,neg,train
"In terms of the pricing, we need to kind of see the full totality of that data and then look at the value that brings to patients",neg,train
That wasn’t at all considered when we took the price concession early that -- this year,neg,train
That was really -- the strategy there was to really enable access to the existing patients that are covered within our label,neg,test
"And as I mentioned earlier, we now have a -- really solid position in the U",neg,train

"I’m just reminding everybody that just as you think about as you work for your own models, remember Q1 is always a little soft",neg,train
"Beginning of the year, we certainly feel good about our plan for the full-year",neg,train
"This year, actually I think we're going to have a very good year here, but that said it's always Q1 that we’ve to remind everybody, hey be careful, because you do have these different dynamics in the U",neg,train
"S healthcare system where you end up with donut hole payments for REV and POM, Abraxane always show some seasonality",neg,train
"You see its softer in the first quarter and then OTEZLA -- yes, I think last year we spent a lot of time talking about the first quarter and it was kind of a market-wide psoriasis market dynamics that affected OTEZLA as well",neg,train
"Now as Terrie said, really this year on the gross to net side there's always a little bit of an effect, but it's nothing like we saw last year",neg,train
"So really we already had contracted most of the market and as Terrie said it's been very successful in terms of getting us away from all these biologic step at its first, so it's a great breakthrough for patients",neg,train
And I guess we're coming up on the end of the hour,neg,train
I feel like you’ve heard from us a lot lately,neg,train
I think we’re headed for a very exciting time period and we really appreciate your support and look forward to working with everybody going forward and certainly we're excited about how Q1 in this year looks rough,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"Salim, I will take the second part of your question, on JCAR125",neg,train
JCAR125 adds to a very broad campaign talked in BCMA,neg,train
"So, the thing to remember is a patient hasn’t been dosed to JCAR125 yet",neg,train
So we’re going to get it quickly into the clinic,neg,train
Since July of last year we've added three late stage assets each with blockbuster potential to our clinical portfolio,neg,train
The acquisition of Juno immediately establishes Celgene as a global leader in the very promising field of cellular immunotherapy,neg,train
It is also an enabler for us to advance our immuno-oncology platform,neg,train
"Perhaps, the first one as you guys have obviously diligenced all the JCAR017 data in a lot of detail",neg,train
"One of the questions I've had is how has the CRS and neurotox rates changed when you look at the first batch of patients versus the next batch of patients versus subsequent batch of patients? I’m just curious what type of progression and the rates are you seeing if you look at these patients in completely different batches and then pull it all up very curious for what trend you saw there, one",neg,train
"And then, secondly, perhaps the quick one on one on the CELMoD that was being tried in myeloma CC-122, I didn’t noticed that from slides anymore",neg,train
"So I was curious what the status is there, if that’s the program in development myeloma still or not? Thank you",neg,train
Our next question comes the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink,neg,train
"On fedratinib, could you expand on what your filing strategy is? Would you be filing for a broad label or for treatment experience label, then your $1 billion estimate is that U",neg,train
So we really remain in a very good place and that's largely due to the access to offshore cash,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Kripa Devarakonda with Citigroup,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan,neg,train
"Looking specifically at OTEZLA, Q4 sales were $371 million, which represents 20% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth",neg,train
", OTEZLA brand volume has continued to grow faster than the market and despite increased competitive intensity, OTEZLA continues to expand its pre-biologic foundation in the market",neg,train
", the brand grew 24% year-over-year fueled by continued gains and duration and market share",neg,train
We are seeing a positive impact from the post stem cell transplant maintenance launch and we expect to see continued increases in duration from the front-line use of REVLIMID as well as the use of triplet combination regimens,neg,train
"In 2017, we significantly accelerate critical programs which have the potential to meaningfully diversify revenue and position us for growth from now through 2020 and beyond, powered by our research and discovery engine built on our internal centers of excellence and combined with high potential industry and academic partnerships",neg,train
"We continue to expand the number and diversity of novel agents entering clinical trials, led by Dr",neg,test
"Rupert Vessey, our distributor research teams and collaborators, advanced more than 25 new molecules into preclinical or Phase 1 development",neg,train
REVLIMID share in front-line on stem cell transplant patients continues to grow across all reimbursed countries,neg,train
REVLIMID is also gaining reimbursement in additional markets in the post transplant maintenance setting with positive uptake,neg,train
"I'll now turn the call over to my colleague, Nadim",neg,train
"For IBD, we plan to complete enrollment of our Phase 3 TRUE NORTH trial in ulcerative colitis and continue to advance the Phase 3 pivotal program for Crohn's disease",neg,test
And I’d now like to turn the call over to Scott,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies,neg,train
"Turning to our net product sales results, in the fourth quarter of 2017, total net product sales were $3",neg,train
Top line growth was driven by 13% volume growth worldwide,neg,test
"Full-year 2017 total net product sales were $13 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year driven by 13",neg,train
Let me just take the last part of your question about momentum,neg,train
"As we discussed on the call, I think quite nicely fourth quarter was a strong quarter for the company with a lot of momentum and a lot of strategic progress",neg,train
We've seen through the early part of January that momentum continuing,neg,test
"So I would argue that the quarter is off to a good start, but it's early",neg,train
"To begin the detailed discussion of our 2017 results, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Kellogg and thank everyone for their attention",neg,train
"Again John you may want to back up on the tax impact from our side too, but Chris on the loan side, I don’t think we are seeing a whole lot of measurable change today or something that we could put our hat on and say this has caused by the tax return but there is a lot of optimism out there today and people are talking about what they want to do in 2018 and it feels different than it did a year ago",neg,train
We have 5 community bank divisions stand up this quarter for deposit growth,neg,train
"West Tennessee, Northeast Arkansas, West South Arkansas, Mid-Mississippi and North Central Alabama divisions all recorded excellent results this quarter",neg,test
2% compared to the fourth quarter of ’16 and $0,neg,train
07 as a percent compared to the third quarter of 2017,neg,train
I like to spend just a moment on the dynamics of our net interest margin which was flat at 358 compared to the third quarter of 2017 and up from 3,neg,train
We continue to see pick-up in our margin from increasing loan yields and relatively stable funding costs,neg,train
33% for the third quarter while our cost to deposits increased only 1 basis point over the same time period from 26,neg,train
We also saw some pick-up in the yield of our securities portfolio during the fourth quarter,neg,train
The next question comes from John Rodis with FIG Partners,neg,train
"All right, thank you all very much for joining us today",neg,train
If you need any additional information or have further questions please don’t hesitate to call us,neg,train
"You got to go all the way back to four years ago, when we made the announcement",neg,test
"Remember these deals were started, we were dancing and talking with these teams all the way back in the follow of 2013 they were both announced in January of 14th",neg,train
"And certainly, since that time, many things we’ve been done on their side to assist us and growing earnings and being more efficient",neg,train
Slide 9 reflects our funding mix at year-end compared to both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
Will Fisackerly - Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Finance,neg,train
Do you have any sense as to whether these two deals will have any large impacts on your margin here? From the deal standpoint or the core margins?,neg,train
"Well, clearly, it’s going to show significant change to the bottom line for us because we were paying an effective tax rate as the top end of the bracket and so there is a huge win for us, we clearly wanted to share some of that with our team mates and we've done that",neg,train
"Total deposits and customer repos increased to $136 million compared to September 30, 2017, and increased a $191 million compared to December 31, 2016",neg,train
The trends reflected in our fourth quarter results were similar to what we've reported for some time now,neg,train
Disciplined pricing of our time deposits has provided a headwind to our overall deposit growth efforts we continue to be pleased with the growth in our lower costs accounts,neg,train
I will begin by introducing the members of the senior management team participating today,neg,train
"We have Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dan Rollins; President and Chief Operating Officer, Chris Bagley and Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Copeland",neg,train
Before the discussion begins I’ll remind you of certain forward-looking statements that may be made regarding the company’s future results or future financial performance,neg,train
Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors and/or risks,neg,train
Now I'll turn it back over to Dan for his concluding remarks,neg,train
Our pipeline was 194 million at December 31st compared to 233 million at September 30 2017,neg,train
We would expect to see these trends reverse as we typically do in the first and second quarter of each year,neg,train
And I guess and maybe as a follow-on could you remind us how much of FICA and payroll taxes that you expect in the first quarter?,neg,test
"On a timing perspective of that, I don’t know that’s this month or next month or this quarter or next quarter but we want to continue to be opportunistic on that front also",neg,train
"Additionally, we had a positive MSR valuation adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2",neg,train
"Accordingly, we reported net operating income excluding MSR of 36",neg,train
43 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017 and 30,neg,test
33 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
One of them again is new territory for us or we’re going to see less opportunity for cost savings in one market over the other,neg,train
We’ve got some branch overlap and some consolidation and some operational teams that we can consolidate,neg,train
As we look at the financial results for the year we reported record annual net income for our company of the 153 million or $1,neg,train
67 per diluted share which represents an increase of $0,neg,train
The next two bullets cover annual loan and deposit growth for the year,neg,train
Both were approximately 2% for the year which is not the level we would have like to have seen,neg,test
Chris will cover our business development efforts more in a moment,neg,test
I think you can look back over the last couple of years and look at compensation stand from one quarter to the next and model up of that,neg,test
"As Dan mentioned, this strategy has helped us hold our total cost of deposits in a very tight range",neg,test
"Additionally, the addition of First State Bank will help up from a liquidity perspective as their loan to deposit ratio at year-end is approximately 60%",neg,train
Our board and management believe the key to the success of our company as our people,neg,train
"Earlier this month, we announce the plan to share of portion of the tax savings for the large percentage of our teammates through salary increases and one-time bonuses",neg,train
"After adjusting for the items I’ve mentioned, fourth quarter net operating income excluding MSR was 36",neg,train
08 per share or 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,test
But I’m assuming we have seen some attrition of [indiscernible] in First State,neg,test
Have any of these cost savings already been realized today?,neg,test
Slide two contains our customary Safe Harbor statement with respect to certain forward-looking information in the presentation,neg,train
"Slide three covers the annual highlights for the year, which reflects continued improvement in profitability",neg,train
"We do expect to continue to see although as we’ve talked about, it was, the effect of recent rate increases on re-pricing variable rate loans was somewhat muted, because of the balance sheet actions that we do continue to see, some benefit from re-pricing as we go through time and of course that excluded the impact of the two acquisitions and the accretion there",neg,train
"With the deals closed now, would you be willing to provide us with the expectation on the earnings accretion from those two transactions?",neg,train
I think our answer is we are constantly searching for people that can produce business for us in any business line,neg,train
I would add to the tree that you mentioned were actively looking for equipment finance relationship builders were actively looking for wealth management relationship builders,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Emlen Harmon with JMP Securities,neg,train
Unless you are growing your own and they still take multiple years so yes insurance is a little bit longer lead,neg,train
"And now, I’ll turn to Dan Rollins for his comments on our financial results",neg,train
Our combined effective tax rate for 2017 was around 34% to 35% with the new federal statutory rate of 21% we expect our combined effective tax rate for '18 to be between 23% and 25%,neg,train
I’d like to touch briefly on a couple of these bullets,neg,train
"We had a provision for credit losses of 500,000 for the fourth quarter compared with a provision of 500,000 for the third quarter of 2017 and provision of 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
Our provision was 3 million for the full year of 2017,neg,train
"We continue to experience low levels of net charge-offs, which were less than 10 basis points for both the fourth quarter annualizing for the full year",neg,train
"(NYSE:BXS) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
"To echo Dan's comments producers are we are constantly requiring and looking for additional producers, any insurance world just little color there that takes little longer lead time to get up one from a production perspective because most of the insurance producers are some type of non-solicitation and non-compete with the existing firm so it takes a little bit longer to get them productive when we say a vendor",neg,train
Total NPLs to net loans and leases have declined to [0,neg,train
And while NPA to net loans and leases have decline from just over 1% to 0,neg,train
And today our other real estate is already as its average $6 million is very low and we’re proud of that,neg,train
The next question comes from David Feaster with Raymond James,neg,train
Well certainly that was a headwind and we've talked about that in early '17 first quarter '17 we identified some significant pay down headwinds that we incurred,neg,train
Let me try that a different John you can jump in here,neg,train
"So, when we look at the onetime bonus numbers that's going to run in the $1 million-dollar range for the first quarter and the $10 million run-up in compensation costs for the year would be all inclusive for our entire year program",neg,train
"So, 1 million of that is our first quarter event and the rest of that would be spread over the years' time",neg,train
And when you look at us on a go forward basis we picked up 400 new people 10 days ago and so the first quarter is going to be muddy and hard to see on some of that probably but that's our current budgeting process,neg,train
I will now turn to John and allow him to discuss our financial results and more detail,neg,train
And coming off a year where you grew to 2,neg,train
What gives you confidence that you want to go out with mid to high single digits is it the tax cuts is -- it I'm assuming that's part of it,neg,train
We continue to have disciplined expense control of the cost virtually in all categories,neg,train
We saw and did see a decline in salaries and employee benefits in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter,neg,test
This decline was driven by a number of factors including reaching cycle limits as well as seasonally lower commissions related to some of our non-interest product offerings,neg,train
As we look at our fourth quarter lending efforts from a geographical perspective,neg,train
We had several divisions produce winning [ph] for loan growth,neg,train
"Stand-up divisions for the quarter were our Dallas, Texas, Houston Texas, Missouri and Pineville divisions",neg,train
"I appreciate your commentary on the buyback outlook, wanted or may not be opportunistic here but what your thoughts on additional M&A now that you have got the deals close?",neg,train
Thank you for joining us today for BancorpSouth’s fourth quarter 2017 conference call,neg,train
I will begin by making a few brief comments regarding the highlights for both the year and the fourth quarter,neg,train
"After we conclude our prepared comments, our executive management team will be happy to answer questions",neg,train
And then on the buyback how price sensitive are you to the buyback? I mean your stack is now about 20% or so higher than where you bought it back last year,neg,train
So how do you kind of balance where the stack price is versus using that capital in further M&A or dividend?,neg,train
Okay and one more from me you talked about the need for hiring in insurance and you've been fairly aggressive in hiring on the mortgage originators over the past year,neg,train
Can you just maybe talk about your hiring expectations both on the mortgage and insurance side as well as new bankers,neg,train
"Moving to slide 10, you will see our loan portfolio as of December 31st compared to the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
"And our loan portfolio is flat compared to September 30, 2017, loans are up 244 million or 2",neg,train
We believe the hurricane season especially Harvey in some uncertainty around the tax changes at the end of the year,neg,train
We continue to harvest cost savings in order to pay for other investments including technology and people,neg,train
"4 million for 2017 compared to 2016, this decline combined with revenue growth resulted in a 200-basis point decline in our operating efficiency ratio excluding MSR from 69",neg,train
Our net interest margin continues to benefit from the reprising of our loan and securities portfolios combined with very stable funding cost,neg,train
"A message related to our insurance business is really no difficult [ph] interest of time, our insurance teammates continue to report a very soft premium market",neg,test
We have to grow our team and grow our customer base in order to generate revenue growth,neg,train
I'm confident in the leadership of our insurance team and the actions they've taken already to help us achieve these goals,neg,train
"I think that's fair so plus or minus a couple of 100,000",neg,train
Dan by my math if I take the end of period September plus what the two banks have that gets you to like 3,neg,train
Earnings benefited from a positive mortgage servicing writes valuation adjustment of 2,neg,train
"Additionally, we had two other items impact in the fourth quarter results that we considered to be non-operating",neg,test
"Additionally, the positive MSR valuation adjustment net of tax was approximately 1 million for the year",neg,train
"Accordingly, net operating income excluding the MSR change was 152 million or $1",neg,train
66 per diluted share which represents an increase of 0,neg,train
"If you'll turn to Slide 7, you'll see detail of our noninterest revenue",neg,train
1 million for the quarter compared to $66 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $73 million for the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
We have a more detailed slide dedicated to these product offerings that Chris will discuss in a moment,neg,train
The other line items on this slide are relatively stable quarter-over-quarter,neg,train

"Good morning, and welcome to the BancorpSouth Fourth Quarter 2017 Webcast and Conference Call",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions",neg,train
"The next question comes from Matt Olney with Stephens, Inc",neg,train
"Or even several months ago, there was just some uncertainty I think there was uncertainty in the fourth quarter a lot of people were feeling that it's gone away and like Dan suggest I think there is some energy and that certainty helps people planned or forward but people are probably still digesting the tax and how it impacts their individual situation but given what we're seeing I would hope it would generate activity in the number of places in our footprint",neg,train
I'm happy for you guys that you can finally get behind it,neg,train
"Just the follow-up on your comment on loan and deposit growth you said mid to high single digits this year I'm sure that excludes the acquisitions, right?",neg,train
"Slide 4, provides a view of our summary financial results over the past 5 years",neg,train
These results further reflect the trends I mentioned on the previous slide,neg,train
"We have driven consistent profitability improvement through growing net interest revenue, stable credit quality and continued declines in our operating expenses",neg,train
These results reflect a compound operating EPS growth of 12% over the past four years culminating with the record annual net income for our company in 2017,neg,train
"And second, we reported additional income tax expense of approximately $600,000 to revalue our net deferred tax assets",neg,train
This adjustment was the result of the corporate tax rate changes enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,neg,train
"If you will turn to slide six, you will see our summary income statement",neg,train
"And while there weren’t large items, Dan did mention two non-operating items, we had during the quarter, which were 700,000 in merger related expenses and 600,000 in net additional tax expense related to strategic tax planning and the deferred tax asset valuation adjustments",neg,train
There were no material non-operating items and results of either of the other two quarters presented here,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Importantly, we were able to repurchase these shares with very minimal impact to our regulatory capital ratios year-over-year",neg,train
"Finally, as Dan mentioned earlier, the MSR valuation adjustment during quarter was 2",neg,test
"Moving to insurance, total commission revenue for the quarter was 25",neg,train
6 million for the third quarter of 2017 and 25,neg,train
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr,neg,train
"Will Fisackerly, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Finance",neg,test
"Congratulations on getting those deals closed, glad that's behind you",neg,test
I just have one quick question on the 10 million of incremental employee expenses,neg,train
Could you maybe break that out between how much is salaries versus the one-time bonus? And just to confirm the bonus would occur in the first quarter and basically that expenses should come back down towards the more normalized run rates inclusive of the higher comp?,neg,train
"Price will play in, so again I want to use the word that I used earlier",neg,train
I think we want to opportunistic with our buyback and everyone be prepared to play,neg,train
On the new tax rate aside from the comp changes does the tax reform change your strategy at all in terms of other investments you would like to make or just capital planning?,neg,train
And lastly on expenses looks like your salaries line item was down about 3 million budgets in 4Q,neg,train
But if I’m hearing you right is more normalized and rebound back-up and you want team as seasonally does,neg,train

"We made several strategic tax planning decisions during the fourth quarter including the pension contribution, which allowed us to minimize the impact of this adjustment",neg,train
"Well, this legislation resulted in a small negative impact for the quarter, it’s a huge win for our shareholders and our company going forward",neg,train
John will cover the impact of the effective tax rate in a moment,neg,train
I would like to reiterate our announcement from earlier this month,neg,train
The first investment we made as a result of this legislation was in our teammates,neg,train
Moving on to for the mortgage and insurance the tables on slide 12 provide a five [ph] quarter look at our results for each product offering,neg,train
Our mortgage banking operation produced origination volume for the quarter totaling 308 million,neg,train
Home purchase money volume was 219 million or 71% of our total volume for the quarter,neg,test
7 million shares of our company stock during 2017 at a weighted average price of $29,neg,train
"Deposit growth for the quarter was 139 million, almost 140 million or 4",neg,train
"Well, total deposit growth for the year was less than we desire",neg,train
"As I mentioned earlier, this growth represented a nice finish to the year",neg,train
Chris will provide additional color including geographical highlights in a moment,neg,train
"Deliveries in the quarter were 267 million, compared to 314 million in the third quarter of 2017 and 380 million in the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
"Production and servicing revenue, which excludes the MSR adjustment totaled 4",neg,train
9 million for the quarter compared to 7 million for the third quarter of 2017 and 5,neg,train
This margin decrease is attributable to decline in our mortgage loan pipeline as we are currently and seasonally slower time of the year for the home sales,neg,train
From a margin perspective the net benefit that I have described was somewhat offset by a balance sheet decision to add incremental borrowings and prefund additional securities purchases that we anticipate using to restructured the securities portfolios that were acquired with the two mergers that closed earlier this month,neg,train
This strategy did result in a positive spread that provided a slight benefit to net interest income but it did hurt our net interest margin for the quarter by approximately 3 basis points,neg,train
"In other words, a slight dilution of that margin and this action also pushed our year-end assets over 15 billion",neg,test
"I think we feel like, we’ve been working hard for the last several years to accomplish all the things that needed to happen to get us to the finish line with our friends in Texas and Louisiana",neg,train
The impact in that first quarter of the [Indiscernible] and then there were increases that will effect later periods as well and that $1 million that Dan eluted to and you throw in the new employees that ORB and FSB coming on board it all gets some loss and a big total but we would have had normal salary increases beginning in June and July anyway without the actions that we took resulting from the tax reform and sharing some of that with our employees so we would had roughly half of that anyway relative to salary increases through the year,neg,train
We started 2018 strong by closing the first two bank transactions our company has completed and over 10 years these transactions will further enhance our ability to continue to improve our operating metrics,neg,train
More importantly as I mentioned earlier we are happy to be able to execute our strategic plan in an effort to grow our company,neg,train
Our Board and management team couldn’t be more pleased with the direction of our company,neg,train
"Coming off of record earnings these two transactions, the tax bill and the rising rate environment position our company for continued success",neg,train
"Again, it's an exciting time to be a part of BancorpSouth team",neg,train
You have a couple of moving items in there that impacted us there some of that is benefit costs recurring comparing to 4Q to 4Q,neg,train
"Are you comparing 3Q to 4Q, because they were different moving parts there",neg,train
"And 4Q ’16, we actually had some increased costs on our healthcare coverage that we did not incur in the year-end true-upping because it goes up",neg,train
"And on the other side, we had a true-up, they saved us or benefit us in 2017 on our incentive plan measurements",neg,train
"But at the end of day, I think you’re going to see a normalized run rate throughout 2018 just as you did last year",neg,train
9 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $130,neg,train
"As I mentioned earlier, the only non-operating items that impacted noninterest expense was the 700,000 of merger related expenses",neg,train
With that operator I'd be happy to answer any questions,neg,train
"Finally, non-interest expense decline compared to both the third quarter of ’17 and the fourth quarter of ’16",neg,test
"You mentioned kind -- in your prepared remarks you made some of the positive economic impacts, potential positive economic impacts from tax reform",neg,train
"Are you starting to see that materialize at all in just non-production, loan demand?",neg,train
We’ve been working with the road folks that we engage to value the loan portfolios that will go [indiscernible],neg,train
I think it’s too pretty mature for us to tell you how that’s going to impact margin from a basis points spread,neg,train
"I think when you look at our core margin, John can talk about that further but we continue to see upward pressure on our core margin excluding the acceptable yield from the purchase side",neg,train
Before we get into the financial results I’d like to go ahead and touch on our recent merger closings,neg,train
We are all happy and pleased to finally have Wichita Independent Bank and FirstState Bank Central Texas as a part of our team,neg,train
"The transaction closings are the result of the lot of hard work and progress by our teammates as well as unwavering support and commitment from the management team, employees, directors and shareholders of our two partners",neg,train
We believe these bankers led by Cloud White and Kevin Co,neg,train
"in Louisiana and Don Gabalski, Eric Gambell, Randy Ramsey and Richard Procter in Texas would be able to support our plan and growth in 2018 and beyond",neg,train
Looking ahead we expect to complete the operational integration of OIB during the first quarter of this year and first state bank during the second quarter of this year,neg,train
"From a capital management perspective, I mean clearly, we are going to have more income and I think as we roll through the year and see the results of some of that we're going to be looking at the stock buyback program that I talked about and we are going to be looking at our dividend rate",neg,train
Chris will now provide some color on our business development activities,neg,train
I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr,neg,train
I would remind you again that fourth quarter is always our lowest quarter for commission revenue as a result of the seasonality and timing of renewals and insurance book of business,neg,train
Information concerning certain of these factors can be found in BancorpSouth’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K,neg,train
"Also during the call, certain non-GAAP financial measures may be discussed regarding the company’s performance",neg,train
"If so, you can find a reconciliation of these measures in the company’s fourth quarter 2017 earnings release",neg,train
Our speakers will be referring to prepared slides during the discussion,neg,train
"com and clicking on our Investor Relations page, where you’ll find them on the link to our webcast or you can view them at the exhibit to the 8-K that we filed earlier this morning",neg,train
"So to summarize on slide 14, we had a great fourth quarter and a great 2017",neg,train
We delivered improved margins across the three primary segments and maintained a strong balance sheet,neg,train
"As we start 2018 we are seeing improving economic indicators across many of our end markets, and we are executing on our strategy with profitable growth and a focus on expanded offerings and services",neg,train
"Despite higher end user demand, dealer inventory was about flat in the quarter, compared with an 800 million inventory reduction in the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
What's driving that and what are you seeing out there that's give you confidence that that's going to get better?,neg,train
And then on the supply chain you folks are very clear within the contemplated range you don't anticipate supply chain being an issue,neg,train
"Can you just give us confidence range, sales are 10% above the high-end of the range which you still feel comfortable with that assessment",neg,train
There if you could just help us understand the confidence spend that you have and you spoke about in the press release improving material flows back of 2017 verse of the first half based on your work with the supply chain,neg,test
"I’m wonder, if you could just quantify the number of problem components that you’re tracking or just help us, quantify that improvement if you don’t mind?",neg,test
"If we step back, keep in mind that we are playing operating margins over the long term and not quarter to quarter",neg,train
There were a couple of things in the quarter that did drive segment margins down,neg,train
"I think if you look at ENT margins they were actually up, so I’ll talk through CI and resource industry that the consolidated level, the biggest driver was period cost absorbed",neg,train
"So if you look at cat inventory growth through 2017, we saw inventory grow through the first three quarters and then actually come down in the fourth quarter largely driven by turbine and rail shipments, but also in the other segments as well",neg,train
The positive changes in operating profit came from several areas with the largest being higher sales volume,neg,train
We saw higher end user demand in all regions and in our three primary segments,neg,train
"This is not something, it’s unusual we've gone to this in the past and it won’t be a major problem for us",neg,train
"So the question is I mean, obviously your corporate results has been very, very good especially in margin",neg,train
"The question is on resources where we at least think it's an exceptional business, you have good market shares and the product runs a lot, so the aftermarket position is structurally good",neg,test
Then I understand some seasonality to margins I get it,neg,train
"But is there any abnormal investment in that business that’s depressing margin, whether on automation otherwise or what was the cause of that lumpiness that we’ve seen last two or three quarters?",neg,train
So at those sales levels I think there is just some lumpiness to the margins,neg,train
New equipment sales are still really low versus historical standard,neg,train
"We’re managing margin, I’d say to the full year and not to the quarter and that’s really where we’re focused at",neg,train
We expect RI to continue to see operating margin growth in 2018 in line with progressing towards achieving the margin numbers they put out for Investor Day,neg,train
"In addition, there's a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that can also be found in this morning's release and is posted at caterpillar",neg,train
"We're going to start the call this morning with a few words from Jim, and then Brad will walk us through fourth quarter results and full year results and our 2018 outlook, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call",neg,train
"And so, we’re really happy with where our balance sheet was coming out of the downturn and what's happened this year",neg,train
And if you look at the outlook for 2018 that’s positive,neg,test
"The incremental margins for 2018, what do you expecting in incremental margins?",neg,train
"2017 was also a good year for price realization, although keep in mind 2016 price realization was significantly negative",neg,train
Most of the price realization in 2017 was in construction industries,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"I would say its not supply constraints, while we talk about the supply constraints and we continue to ramp suppliers and get production up, in the adjusted profit guidance that we provided supplier constraints are not any issue and we don’t expect them to be an issue I should say",neg,train
"I will step back and say though, if you look at the overall performance we expect operating margins for the consolidated company, and for all three segments to improve from where we ended 2017 and we’re looking as – Jim talked about the long game not quarter over quarter pulled throughs, but long-term margin performance",neg,train
"And for Cat, that actually put the operating margin in the range as we provided at Investor Day at lower volume",neg,test
And then second is just on that the backlog and resources and really what kind of the implied profitability of those orders,neg,train
And I'm wondering if you're seeing any kind of signs of broadening out in terms of order trends by geography and really by payload in terms of size and the machines,neg,train
It looks from an industry perspective anyway that's really this little recovery with more the deliveries had been directed more towards regions where CAT share wouldn’t necessarily be as favored,neg,train
So I’m just curious if you're kind of seeing a broadening out to more the traditional mining regions,neg,train
So any comments there it would be helpful? Thank you,neg,train
We do think that the Chinese market is currently above normal replacement demand and will slow at some point,neg,test
But our current read on the market that it’s going to remains strongly at least through the first half of the year,neg,train
"And I apologize to push, but I know that’s a scripted answer, but incremental margins in particular they were 30% for the equipment company in the fourth quarter, 40 the prior two quarters",neg,train
"Can you give us, at least, a perspective how you expect incrementals to be in 2018 versus what they were of late?",neg,train
We are really happy with tax reform in a lot of different areas,neg,train
There has been a lot of good momentum around smart regulation and now tax reform,neg,train
As it relates to our cash it gives us a lot more flexibility in our decision making in terms of how to use that cash,neg,train
And one thing that we had talked about in terms of U,neg,train
competitiveness is that when you put on an added tax on charge of using cash in the U,neg,train
And so now basically that that added taxes been removed and so provides really a level playing field for cash,neg,train
"In addition to strong mining activity, global economic growth should also be a positive for heavy construction equipment, which is included in resource industries",neg,train
"I think what I can say is that we expect them to continue deliver strong performance early in the cycle, the pull-through are strong and you see if you look through a quarter over quarter pull-through, they do start to slow down which makes a lot of sense as you bring production back on line",neg,train
We are committed to investing in growth through the P&L next year,neg,train
"But we still expect and know strong performance and to continue to deliver good returns, good operational margin increases on the sales growth",neg,train
Resource industries had their strongest quarter for sales to users in over two years as miners began to increase capital expenditures,neg,train
Aftermarket parts demand remained high to support increased mining activity and also to support overalls and rebuilds,neg,train
The 2017 gain on the sale of securities and financial products is not planned to repeat,neg,train
We expect restructuring cost to be about $400 million for the full year,neg,test
"We have an estimated, a 24% tax rate which includes the impacts of U",neg,test
"As has been our historical practice, we have not assumed any share buyback in our outlook",neg,train
We expect to continue delivering strong performance with improving operating margins as we execute on our strategy focused on operational excellence and profitable growth,neg,train
It really was a great quarter with improved sales across all regions and nearly all end market,neg,train
The team delivered strong margins while also investing in targeted initiatives to help us grow the business profitably,neg,train
"Today, I’m going to walk through both the quarter, the full year 2017 and then I will move onto discuss our outlook",neg,train
"I will say, if you look at the 2017 sales cadence, it did not follow historical norms",neg,train
We saw continued acceleration in the industry as the year progressed,neg,test
"And what we highlighted in the release and in Brad’s comments is we don't expect to repeat, so we would expect China to revert back to more normal sales patterns with 60% to 65% of sales in the first half of the year and then for that to slow down considerably in the back half of the year",neg,train
"I will be ready if that's not the case, but that’s currently our assumption",neg,train
We’ve had a very long history of dividend growth which we’re proud of and that remains important,neg,train
So you probably want a little bit more but that's where we’re at right now,neg,train
"However, with increased global demand, we believe dealer inventories for machines remained lean at 3",neg,train
"This is up slightly in terms of monthly sales from the end of the third quarter of 2017, but still below historical norms",neg,train
"So, I think it’s clear, I’m not going to answer that question directly",neg,train
"Incrementals for the full year of 2017 were 40%, that's pretty high",neg,train
"It is -- 2018 is largely a year of sales growth, that’s clearly the biggest driver and the profit per share growth",neg,train
"And even with a nice, steep tailwinds we are looking at investing in the business, investing through the P&L, growing our digital and online offerings, investing in products, and so I don’t have an exact answer for you David, but…",neg,train
"Coming off four years of decline, the production increases we saw throughout the year challenged our suppliers",neg,train
"We are working closely with them to reduce lead time and raise production levels; however, we have seen lead times extend on some products",neg,train
"Before I discuss our capital allocation priorities, first I want to cover the impacts of the U",neg,train
Returning capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases remains important,neg,train
"I’m curious philosophically why you have decided not to provide revenue guidance or at least revenue guidance ranges by segment, I mean, this is an era where investors I think are looking for more transparency not less",neg,train
"And then, as a follow-on to that, I mean, what should we contemplate in our models to get to the low end of your guidance versus the high end of your guidance",neg,train
And if you could just talk about what's in the model that you’re looking it to get to the low end and the high end?,neg,train
"And this is Jim, maybe just to add some color to that",neg,train
"Traditionally, we thought about growth at Caterpillar, investing in R&D and investing in capital in terms of building new factories",neg,train
Brad or Jim you spoke earlier to the benefit to Cat’s tax rate from the recent tax reform,neg,train
I’m curious how you are thinking about the potential for some -- the repatriation of what I believe to be is 5 plus billion dollars of foreign cash,neg,train
If you step back and I think repeat what I just said to Ann,neg,train
"Its strong operating performance overall, it’s an improvement in operating margin for the company that puts the company operating margin in the ranges that we provided at Investor Day and shows improvement for all three segments in the 2018",neg,train
"And for construction industries, they actually ended the year at the top into that range, so they’re showing a little bit of improvement on top of that",neg,train
Changes to dealer inventories were favorable and end-user demand for equipment improved in the second half,neg,test
"The increase in sales for Energy & Transportation was led by strong demand for North American oil, onshore oil and gas",neg,train
"However, for the full year sales were up across all four Energy & Transportation applications",neg,test

"And again, we see sales increasing in all three segments, again as Amy mentioned, operating margins will increase in all three segments as well 2017 to 2018",neg,train
"Ann, this is Jim, I’ll start then I’ll hand it over to Amy or Brad",neg,train
And we believe that that providing an EPS range is an appropriate way to go,neg,train
"Why don't you take it from there, Amy, and I'll jump back in",neg,train
You guys call out the tightness in the supply chain,neg,train
I wonder if you could just give a little more color on where exactly that tightness is and what did you actually assume that the supply chain has to do to meet demand just sort of comfortable that you didn't get over your skis with the assumptions this year,neg,train
"So, yes, I’d say, we are more confident on the Chinese construction market than we were a quarter ago",neg,train
"If you – we are forecasting industry growth for the 10-ton-and-above excavator which are the numbers we normally cite, to be up about 8% next year in the outlook",neg,test
"We were not there just a quarter ago, so I think that's reflective of continued – seen continued strength in the Chinese economy",neg,train
"As we look at our operating execution model and operational excellence, there is really a number of elements that we are focused on",neg,train
"In terms of operational excellence, it’s safety, quality and lean, so we are very much focused on getting more production out of existing bricks and mortar",neg,train
"So we don’t anticipate investing in new factories, what we are really doing is meeting the increased demand through lean manufacturing advances and also frankly, we have plenty of bricks and mortar",neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, we made a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our U",neg,train
pension plans and we retired $900 million of debt that was due in December 2018,neg,train
"Now if we look to slide 13, I’ll talk about a few more items impacting our 2018 outlook",neg,train
Higher sales volume is the largest driver of the improvement in the profit outlook,neg,train
"5 billion, which is up 18% from 2016, a strong start to the year for construction in China, North American gas compression and mining rebuild ended with increases in construction demand across all regions, mining fleas being put back to work, orders for new mining equipment increasing and strong demand for onshore oil and gas equipment in North America",neg,train
"Good morning, I’d like to welcome everyone, to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call",neg,test
"I'm pleased to have on the call today, our CEO, Jim Umpleby; our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson; and our Vice President of Financial Services, Joe Creed",neg,train
"Jim, I’m wondering if you can talk about the operate and execute plan",neg,train
"So, we really saw the sales variance allocation piece really move the needle for you folks in 2017, and as we think about based on what you folks have in the pipeline which we look for has being meaningful improvements in the business in 2018?",neg,train
We are in the early stages of implementing our strategy for profitable growth,neg,train
Do you have any closing comments you’d like to finish with,neg,train
"And again sorry to push, but versus the 30 for the fourth quarter, are we expecting to be higher or lower",neg,train
"We’re just trying to think structurally just more of a revenue year where hey, the incrementals are little bit lower, we’re investing in the business or maybe a little supply constraint and keep the revenues low but will still give you a big incremental",neg,train
Are the incremental similar to the fourth quarter or lower or may be even higher?,neg,train
"Now let’s walk through some outlook assumptions in each of our three primary segments, if we move to slide 10",neg,train
"For construction industries, the pie on the right breaks out our 2017 sales by region for construction industries",neg,train
"In 2018, we expect all regions to improve and segment sales to be higher",neg,train
I wanted to ask you couple of questions on construction,neg,train
It sounds like you’re messaging that -- I think on the last quarter call you kind of message that you thought China would be -- had potential to be softer here in the first half of the or first part of the year,neg,train
"But it sounds like today you’re sort of saying, you think China is strong at least through the first half and maybe softens in the back half",neg,train
Did something change there or you more confident on the Chinese construction equipment market?,neg,train
Now let’s look at the 2018 Outlook on slide nine,neg,test
Today are providing a 2018 Outlook for profit per share in a range of $7,neg,train
75 and an adjusted profit per share range of $8,neg,test
We are moving away from providing a sales and revenue Outlook range as our new company strategy is focused of profitable growth through the cycle,neg,train
In terms of share repurchase I think we just put that in there to be clear that in accordance of historical practice we don’t assume share buyback and I think given the changes in U,neg,train
tax reform and a lot of discussion we just wanted to clear on what our guidance is,neg,train
We don’t usually state that but that how we always put the outlook together at the beginning of the year,neg,train
"So not that material, let me go back to 2010 and 2011 when you’re building the inventory would go up 900 million then obviously 2011 and 2012 we’re up notably large",neg,train
"We should not assume 1 billion plus type dealer inventory increase, when you say moderate sort of in the hundreds of millions",neg,train
Now let’s look at the long term impacts of the new tax legislation,neg,test
About half of the sales growth was in construction industries led by strong end user demand in North America and Asia Pacific,neg,train
And about half of the increase in Asia Pacific was due to higher sales into China,neg,train
And so I think that's really reflective of strong performance delivering on the profitable growth that we’re committed to,neg,train
"And sorry, Jim, what if demand higher than the high end of the range, or guess what’s the level of confidence that you scale up to",neg,train
"Well, the cause in lumpiness probably has a lot to do with the sales changes, although we did see a sales growth in the fourth quarter",neg,test
We talked about a little bit of negative mix there as they moved to a higher percentage of their sales being new equipment as opposed to aftermarket,neg,train
We also talked about in the third quarter and we saw this translates that they – we had pick up and R&D spend for some product programs,neg,train
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar full year and 4Q 2017 Results Conference Call",neg,train
"At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation",neg,train
"3 billion, with about half due to the decision to close the Gosselies Belgium facility",neg,train
The full year results also benefited from a decrease in mark-to-market losses and the absence of a goodwill impairment that I discussed earlier,neg,train
"Just wanted to go back to construction industries if we can, and maybe give you view on North American demand maybe frame that is how our thinking your 2018 outlook versus normalized demand or mid cycle",neg,train
"And I guess, I’m wondering, in your comment in the slide here that talks about improvement in residential, non-residential an infrastructure",neg,train
What do you feel most comfortable that you’re going to see the improvement,neg,train
And what does that in terms of equipment next year in 2018?,neg,train
Most commodity prices are above investment thresholds and are driving increases in mining production,neg,train
"We also increased our focus on services, including the aftermarket support in digital enabled solutions",neg,test
For the full year material costs were just slightly unfavorable with most of the impact coming in the second half,neg,train
Material cost reduction actions do not completely offset the headwinds from higher steel cost,neg,train
"So, Mig, I’ll start with where we had normalized demand",neg,test
I think we are trying to get our way from calling the cycles,neg,train
"I wanted to ask about the Q4 segment margins they declined sequentially in an all three of the major equipment categories despite higher sequential revenue, and I know some of it is related to short-term incentive comp, but could you provide some further detail on really what drove that sequential margin performance?",neg,train
And we saw a favourable impact from the absence of the goodwill impairment of $595 million that resource industries recognized in the fourth of 2016,neg,train
The remainder of the charge is largely the cost of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U,neg,test
"These charges reflect a reasonable estimate as of January 18, 2018",neg,train
"However, these estimates may change as additional guidance is issued; assumptions are refined and any potential actions that could be taken as a result of the legislation",neg,train
"I’m sure you can imagine, it’s an ongoing discussion with the government",neg,train
For Energy & Transportation the strength of the North America onshore oil and gas continued to be the largest driver of sales growth,neg,test
"In addition, sales were up across all applications in E&T",neg,train
"So, if you look at it, there are lots of puts and takes for 2018 guidance, really they largely met out and it is a sales story",neg,train
For mix particularly it’s really not very meaningful and probably slightly unfavorable as we see for resource industries move to a larger percentage of their sales base being new equipment as opposed to aftermarket parts,neg,train
"So there’s just a shift in that sales, but overall and even for resource industries it’s a fairly small negative",neg,train
"We didn’t see really much impact to that in 2017, but our channel check, look like that we’re going to start to see some of that spending that was approved at the state and local level start to come through and drive some infrastructure growth in 2018",neg,train
So mix is certainly a big part of it particularly when you're dealing with lower levels,neg,train
"Its easier to, I think it have a larger shift due to mix",neg,train
"Steve, I see over the last several years spend kind of $1 billion to $1",neg,train
"In 2017 it came in a little bit below $1 billion, so some of that is, we spend a little less than we anticipated",neg,train
"In 2017 we thought we’d spend closer to $1 billion, $1",neg,train
"What’s driving that, a lot of that is maintaining the capital, the machines and the facilities that we have",neg,train
There are capital demands as we restructure and consolidate facilities to put lines in and so moving production from one facility to another,neg,train
Those are the largest drivers of the capital increases in 2018,neg,train
I’d like to now discuss our cash deployment priorities as this has been a topic of interest recently,neg,train
"So dealer inventory, we have been pretty transparent into the year lean and dealers we would expect they would typically grow dealer inventory in the first quarter to get ready for the spring selling season",neg,train
"If you look broadly at the dealer inventory composition, I’d say in total we’re pretty comfortable with it, but there are a few regions most notably China where dealer inventories are low",neg,train
And so we would expect in a few regions for there likely to be some but not that much material dealer inventory growth in 2018,neg,train
Let’s move to slide 12 and look at Energy & Transportation,neg,train
"Again, the slide shot on the right reflects a breakout of 2017 sales by application",neg,train
We expect sales for Energy & Transportation to be up for the full year,neg,train
We are positioned to capitalize on continued sales momentum or quickly adjust should conditions change,neg,train
Thank you next question today is coming from Mig Dobre,neg,test
We would not assume as much as we had on those earlier years,neg,train
Total period costs were higher by $482 million; the largest driver of this increase was higher short-term incentive compensation expense; however cost were also up as we increase spending on targeted investment aimed at profitable growth initiatives as well as to support higher production levels,neg,train
Is it fair to interpret from your comments on resources again about the breadth of the recovery in the customer basis,neg,train
"Your order book kind of widening out as you see people -- I mean, more people bid or quote opposed to patchy?",neg,train
"It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Amy Campbell, Director of Investor Relations",neg,train
Let’s turn to slide seven; we’ll look at operating profit for the full year,neg,train
"By far the most significant drivers of profit was the higher sales volume, with nearly half that increasing construction industries led by China, but followed by improvement in North America",neg,train
"So from a sequential perspective, there was less favorable cost absorption into inventory as inventory came down slightly in the quarter versus growing in the three quarters prior to that",neg,train
"And for resource industries, I mean Brad talked about this in the script",neg,train
"For the first quarter we really saw a significant increase in new equipment sales, which had a slight impact on margin, still very good margin, strong margins for the year the second highest quarter for the full year, but that did drive some of the sequential erosion and margins for resource industry",neg,train
The sales for construction industries were up 47% in the quarter and construction continues to ramp up supply to meet demand,neg,train
"Many of construction industries products are on managed distribution, so with that they take orders for current month plus two or three",neg,train
And so there’s not unconstrained demand coming through the backlog,neg,train
And so that’s really the driver of why you didn’t see a more significant increase in the backlog for construction industries,neg,train
"We saw higher shipments of locomotives, higher rail services driven by increased rail traffic, strong economic fundamentals for industrial engine applications and several large power generation deals that were in the fourth quarter",neg,train
Let me give you some examples of the progress we’ve made thus far,neg,train
"In 2017, we introduced our first model of our next-generation of excavators",neg,train
"In addition to responding to the increase in volume and delivering strong financial results, we developed and began to implement our new strategy to deliver profitable growth by focusing on operational excellence, expanded offerings and services",neg,train
"And then just a follow up, does the, does the tax, the new tax legislation help you guys reach a settlement any quicker with the government over your long-term tax dispute?",neg,train
88 about double 2016's adjusted profit per share of $3,neg,test
"Again, adjusted profit per share for the full year excludes several large adjustments and we provided a reconciliation of those in Q&A number one of the release",neg,train
"Having said that, we do expect improved operating margins in all three segments in 2018 compared to 2017 on an annual basis",neg,train
"There isn’t one big issues, it’s kind of across the board and we’re working with our suppliers to break our way through those",neg,train
We build an aftermarket demand should continue as the parked fleet comes back online,neg,train
And an extension of existing mines should drive demand for new equipment,neg,test
I wondered if you could talk about the key focal areas of your operational excellence and the simplification,neg,train
"And maybe if you can comment in that same vein on maybe medium-term if that 25% incremental margin that you guys have targeted over the long-term would start to change, would start to move up a little bit?",neg,train
"(NYSE:CAT) Q2 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 11:00 AM ET",neg,train
"I can just add, just expand upon on some of Amy’s comments",neg,train
"And with that, Kate, that needs to be our last question",neg,train
In -- for 2018 we are beginning the year with strong order rate and increasing backlog and lean dealer inventory,neg,train
"In addition, the global economy is the strongest it has been in several years with nearly every region of the world expected to grow in 2018",neg,train
"So I guess also on the revenue growth, if say, the framework is 25 incrementals, 15% top line and you have a little less CAT financial income, we get that",neg,train
The backlog and orders are up roughly about 30% year-over-year,neg,train
"If you can help us meet with the dealer inventory for 2018, what is expected for that, so at least we have a sense of that swing?",neg,train
"First, I’d like to thank our team for delivering strong results throughout 2017",neg,train
"After four challenging years, many of our end markets improved and our team capitalized on the opportunity and achieved excellent results",neg,test
"As demand improved during the year, we stayed disciplined and maintained control of our structural costs",neg,train
"For North America, we expect improvement in both residential and non-residential construction",neg,train
"And after many years of disappointing under investment in infrastructure, we expect demand to be up slightly in 2018",neg,train
"We saw the largest increase in North America, with improved demand for construction equipment as well as our onshore oil and gas equipment",neg,train
18 per share in the quarter versus a loss of $2 per share in 2016,neg,train
It’s important to note that adjusted profit per share excludes several large adjustments including the impact of U,neg,train
"tax reform, restructuring cost, mark-to-market losses for the re-measurement of pension and OPEB plans, state deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments and a goodwill impairment charge we took in 2016",neg,train
And so we did talk about an operating range for all three segments at investor day,neg,train
We are very still committed to meeting those ranges based upon the revenue levels that we stated at the time,neg,train
There will be fluctuations over time and we are not just focused on increasing margins although we are committed to meeting those targets,neg,train
9 billion were up 35% from the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"The largest driver of the sales increase was volume, driven by an increase in end user demand for new equipment across all of our regions",neg,train
Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation rotation contributed about equally to the remaining sales growth,neg,train
"For resource industries, aftermarket parts demand was strong for builds to put mining fleets back to work and to support higher fleet utilization",neg,train
"Total period cost were higher by $928 million, however excluding short-term incentive compensation expense, period costs were favorable for the year, largely a result of continued cost reductions and restructuring actions",neg,train
"The ranges in 2018, I just want to make sure, I get this absolutely correct",neg,train
The ranges for operating performance for each segment in 2018 will be within the ranges you gave at the Analyst Meeting on lower volumes?,neg,train
"This morning, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information",neg,train
A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in cautionary statements filed with the SEC and is also in our forward-looking statements language included in today's financial release and the presentation,neg,train
"Before we begin the Q&A portion of the call, I just want to take a minute to announce a slight change in the release of retail staff",neg,train
"In addition, we expect demand for drilling equipment to remain soft as it was for all of 2017",neg,train
"For solar turbines the current backlog is healthy, largely driven by the midstream pipeline business",neg,test
We expect Latin America to continue to recover a bit of what continues to be a very low base versus historical trends,neg,train
Europe continues to deliver stable and steady growth across most of the regions,neg,train
"We believe stabilizing oil prices and attractive commodity prices should also be better for Africa, the Middle East and the CIs countries",neg,test
"Lastly, we expect to see continued growth in Asia-Pacific led by China",neg,train
Our forecast is for China to remain strong for the first half of the year and then slow in the second half which reflects normal seasonality,neg,test
"When we look at variable manufacturing cost, we saw favorable $433 million largely due to cost absorption, as we increased inventory to support higher production levels in 2017 as compared to reducing inventories in 2016",neg,train
We expect short-term incentive compensation expense to be about $900 million,neg,train
"Additionally while market conditions are favorable, the pricing environment remains competitive",neg,train
"As a result, we expect slightly favorable price realization to be mostly offset by unfavorable material cost, largely driven by higher commodity prices",neg,train
"So as we mentioned earlier onshore North American oil and gas has been quite strong, it was quite strong in 2017",neg,train
Drillings relatively slow but well servicing is certainly and gas compression is quite strong for us,neg,train
As we also mentioned there’s a good backlog for solar for midstream gas compression,neg,train
As we look around the world in terms of offshore oil and gas that's still fairly depressed and we don’t see a major increase in that business in 2018,neg,train
So offshore drilling and offshore solar turbines applications will be relatively muted again in 2018,neg,train
"As a positive factors on the profit walk for the quarter, with favourable moves and restructuring cost mark-to-market and goodwill",neg,test
Restructuring cost were $150 million favorable versus the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"Mark-to-market losses on the re-measurement of our pension and OPEB plan were $301 million, which was $684 million less than the loss we recognized in 2016",neg,test
"Variable manufacturing cost were favorable 170 million, largely due to cost absorption as inventories remained about flat versus a significant reduction in inventories in the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
And then can you just frame the 1 to 1,neg,train
So what's the increase therefore? Is that for automation or efficiency investments? Is it tax benefit motivated? If you could just kind of frame that a little bit?,neg,train
"Amy, sorry to push again on 2018, but is there anything you can help us with regard to mix in 2018 versus 2017, because obviously that would have big impact on incremental margins? And then my second question I know guys that some on capital allocation haven’t really change your strategy, but also in your guidance you do say, our numbers don’t assume any share purchase which you usually don't put in your guidance, that -- to specify, we’re not including share purchase",neg,train
I'm just wondering if you are trying to signal something? Thanks,neg,train
Now let’s move on to review the full year starting on slide six,neg,train
We started 2017 by preparing from what could have been another down year,neg,train
"However, we quickly saw increased demand in a few end markets, which spread as the year progressed",neg,train
"Then by the end of the year, all regions in the three primary segments saw increases in sales",neg,train
That’s the first time in a very long time that we can say that,neg,train
"As we expected price realization was less favorable than the third quarter of 2017, but was still positive 213 million",neg,train
The favorable change was primarily due to construction industry and was largely the result of a weak pricing environment a year ago and price action taken in 2017,neg,train
"And then one last one on the backlog growth, when we and others and you mentioned in the call do our channel checks in order to deliver lead times are extending",neg,train
It seems like some of that is concentrating construction industries but the backlog was pretty flat,neg,train
Is there something else going on within construction industries that kind of offset the implied building backlog?,neg,train
tax reform I will break it into two sections; the impact on our 2017 results and the long-term benefits of the bill,neg,test
The fourth quarter provision for income taxes included a charge of about $2,neg,train
4 billion as a result of the enactment of U,neg,train
There are two primary components of this charge; the first is about $600 million right down of our net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction and the U,neg,train
You may disconnect your phone lines at this and have a wonderful day,neg,test
Economic indicators are positive at the moment and we expect a strong start to 2018,neg,train
"Our focus on operational excellence will not waver as we work to develop a more competitive and flexible cost structure, including implementing lean manufacturing principles",neg,train
"And that’s actually kind of good segue on my second question moving to energy and transportation, maybe a little bit more color on the oil and gas component of that business and your thoughts on solar going forward?",neg,train
"I think if you look at the range of adjusted PPS that was provided Ann, and I think we were pretty clear about this",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions",neg,test
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today is coming from Andrew Casey,neg,test
Let’s turn to slide five and we’ll look at the reconciliation of operating profit for the quarter,neg,train
As you can see fourth quarter operating profit was $1,neg,train
So in the month of the release retail stats will be released after the market closes the day before the release,neg,test
"So with that Kate, I’ll move it back to you to begin the Q&A portion of the call",neg,train
We have not incorporated any impacts from a potential U,neg,train
"infrastructure bill on our outlook, and if one were passed, it would be positive, but we were not expect it to materially impact our 2018 results",neg,train
"Remember, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited",neg,train

"I would say, exactly where we’re going to see the strength in 2018",neg,test
"I don’t have that broken out between residential, non-residential infrastructure",neg,train
I’ll say that infrastructure has disappointed us the last couple of years,neg,train
"Hopefully it don’t this year, we’ll see how the year plays out",neg,train
The largest of the adjustments to profit per share was the estimated impact of the U,neg,test
But you can also find more detail in each of these adjustments on page 14 of the press release,neg,train
"Well, we competed every day and some people have - so I don't know",neg,train
"But probably expect the same on me, but I don't expect anything specifically about that",neg,train
"And if besides, I feel like we're in really good spot",neg,test
"I mean as just Jerry said, there is increases in rates",neg,train
"Peter certainly it's a different outlook, but really right now based on what we're seeing and what we're doing",neg,train
"So at this point don't really see any change in our strategy, but the guys in our investment area keep an eye on that every day, but as far as any sort of huge structural change for us in that investment portfolio, no you shouldn't expect anything like that",neg,train
Now moving to our financial performance and looking at our net interest margin,neg,train
Our net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3,neg,train
"73% reported last quarter, but as a reminder, last quarter we had an adjustment to our tax exempt loan balances, which had a 3 basis point positive improvement on our net interest margin percentage",neg,train
And then the potential for that to get competed away the remainder of the benefit? I mean how do you feel about that?,neg,train
"So with the December rate hike, we did have additional increases in deposit costs",neg,train
"So we're going ahead and increase some of our rates, given what we were saying with alternative products that the customers could go into",neg,train
"So our deposit beta is probably on the high end like in our - we've talked about before, our high yield money market account, which was at 35 basis points for balances over 250,000",neg,train
We had 40% beta on that product as an example,neg,train
Those are big dollar expenditures and we get some air cover with that - with the tax law change to do that and have some earning capacity to reinvest,neg,train

And then you add to that that we're doing it,neg,train
"It's that simple in one sense, but in another sense, it's that hard because you can't put that together without a focus in commitment over a long period of time",neg,train
"We couldn't sit here you come up with a plan from next year that says let's do all this, okay",neg,train
"You can do it, but we've got it in place, people are doing it",neg,train
"If you adjust out the impact from the correction of the tax exempt income issue, the net interest margin is flat with last quarters adjusted net interest margin percentage of 3",neg,train
"We had some positive effects offsetting some negative effects, but I would summarize by saying the favorable effect of higher yields on earning assets and higher loan volumes were offset by higher deposit costs and higher balances at the Fed",neg,train

Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI,neg,train
These digital account openings that help us grow while still applying the same Frost standards that we have in place were traditional account openings,neg,train
"During the fourth quarter, Frost has been named in money magazine's list of the best banks in America, which included the designation as the best bank in Texas",neg,train
"And Global Finance magazine named Frost, the best private bank in the Southwest",neg,test
Bank also can get to be 150 years old without great bankers,neg,train
"As we roll out our 150 anniversary celebrations this year, we plan to do at least 150 volunteer projects and community improvement efforts throughout Texas",neg,train
"And when you have a great culture like that over time, it draws me between and end up with great people and so when you add to that, a great value proposition and you add to that we're in tremendous markets",neg,train
There is someone to find a better place to do business in Texas today,neg,train
"This morning's conference call will be led by Phil Green, Chairman and CEO; and Jerry Salinas, Group Executive Vice President and CFO",neg,train
"Before I turn the call over to Phil and Jerry, I need to take a moment to address the Safe Harbor provisions",neg,train
7% due to high customer acquisition in strong retention of existing customers,neg,train
Same-store sales growth for new account origination is up by 7,neg,train
4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with strong growth in all regions,neg,train
"I was wondering, first, if we could start with just the outlook on loan growth",neg,train
"It was strong quarter, and when we look at about 10% year-over-year, Phil just based on some of the numbers you guys shared in the prepared remarks, do you expect loan growth to get stronger relative to what we saw this year and just in terms of the make-up of loan growth that you expect in 2018?",neg,train
"With that, I'll turn the call back over to Phil for questions",neg,train
We appreciate your interest in our Company and we will be adjourned,neg,train
"One of the largest ATM networks in Texas, and outstanding mobile app, and expanded branch footprint, and competitive deposit rates",neg,train
So just the spread you're getting on these relationships that will bringing it now or much more valuable than they have were almost real interest,neg,train
"And so incense continued to focus on relationships, creates what once call it around high class problem, your growing deposits",neg,train
Tightening labor markets could make it more challenging for Texas businesses to find qualified workers in 2018,neg,train
"Because of the labor tightness, the Dallas Fed reports that Texas wages begin rising in 2017 for the first time in three years",neg,train
"I'd say, I think we didn't - I wouldn't say we hit a home run as much as we hit a bunch of singles and doubles, and we want to continue to do that",neg,train
And I think that's the way to rack up runs in the long-term,neg,train
And we feel like we've left some money on the table and that we have the ability with the correct products to scale that business in a quality way and we've been doing it,neg,train
So I'll love what we did and this year in terms of the growth and the level of growth and I'm optimistic about being consistent with that and continuing that growth for this year,neg,train
"First of all, with regard to reinvesting in the business, yes, we are doing that",neg,train
"Employment total has surpassed pre-Hurricane Harvey levels, while energy related jobs are increasing",neg,train
Financial activities and trade and transportation and utilities are the strongest sectors,neg,train
"For Texas as a whole, the Dallas Fed projects 2",neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"We understand this balance sheet and how it works, who knows",neg,train
"But the thing is - those things are great and sometimes it's better to be lucky than good on that spot, it seems fantastic",neg,train
"Today, I'll review fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results for Cullen/Frost, and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will also provide additional comments before we open it up to your questions",neg,train
"For our larger customers, new commitments had above $10 million accounted to 53% of commitment growth",neg,train
"Overall, new loan commitments are about 17% from last year",neg,train
"In 2017, we had a 27% increase in opportunities from customers",neg,train
"That indicates that customers have an increased need for new financing to support their growth, which is a reflection of a stronger economy",neg,train
This time the sustainable organic growth is only possible by building the long-term relationships with our customers,neg,test
The municipal portfolio had a yield for the quarter of 5,neg,train
And at the end of the fourth quarter about 68% of municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured,neg,train
The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was 4,neg,train
"Most of my questions - all my questions actually have been answered so, thank you",neg,train

Fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results include the benefit or net basis of $4 million or $0,neg,train
06 a share to adjust deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,neg,train
"On the tax reform benefit, can you just talk to us a little bit about how you're thinking about how much of that falls to the bottom line and how much of that stays there? And do you think there's going to be any intentional reinvestment into the business in terms of the infrastructure and personnel and everything, but also how do you think about the potential for it to be computed away by the industry and some of your competitors? Thanks",neg,train
"Regarding Dallas-Fort Worth, according to the Dallas Fed, Metroplex employment expanded 2",neg,train
Job gains generally were broad-based and strongest in the second half of the year,neg,train
"I wanted to ask, you've always had a pre-approved balance sheet in the past years and a fairly low loan-to-deposit ratio",neg,train
"I'm curious, Phil, just thinking about this year, I know you're trying to execute on a lot of the things you are doing last year and growing relationships in commercial and consumer",neg,train

So we're using it to grow the business and that's what I'd love to do,neg,train
I mean I love for us to pay capital and brought back in the business and continuously grow,neg,train
So we've really got to - I think the three legs in stool and we have utilized and we will continue to be utilized in those,neg,train
As you can see a strong fourth quarter kept a very good year overall in 2017,neg,train
"Besides the excellent earnings, our return on average assets reached 1",neg,train
One area of focus in 2017 was balanced quality loan growth and we had good results,neg,train
"I know last quarter, you all had margin guidance of around the 3",neg,train
"70% level, which is exactly where you came in the fourth quarter",neg,train
Do you think that will hold up as we go into 2018? I realize with the tax adjustment off to be the marginal will look closer to 3,neg,train
40% margin is the right way to think about 2018?,neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba from SunTrust,neg,train
And you're very valuable because they grow organically as the businesses grow and they're very amenable to a lot of new services we're offering and we offer because your smaller customers,neg,train
"It doesn't sound very sexy, if you put it frankly",neg,train
"We've got our focus on the consumer side, which really is just expanding relationships, 45% of the relationships that we have of our deposit basis consumer related, and those are great relationships",neg,train
"I think there's an underlying reutilization that being successful in a broad-based way, in a balanced way, in the loan portfolio in great markets, remember that, is going to result in other things equal to some increase in loan to deposit ratio",neg,test
Average total deposits in the fourth quarter rose to $26,neg,train
4 billion that was up by 4% from the $25,neg,train
"Throughout 2017, we saw broad-based growth in our deposit portfolio",neg,train

"Regarding estimates for full-year 2018 earnings, we currently believe that the current need of analyst estimate of $6",neg,train
"Yes, so in other words, if I take that out fourth quarter was about $10 million, $9",neg,train
6 million in the third on a core basis what you said was somewhat elevated and that's around $7 million in the first half?,neg,train
I would like to thank everyone at Frost for all their hard work and dedication as we celebrate this milestone and move ahead to future accomplishments,neg,train

Our total deposit costs for the quarter were 11 basis points,neg,train
"I think in the - the fourth quarter I guess of this year, I'm looking at - included, I guess that we had about a $2 million gain on the sale of the property",neg,train
"So that mean despite you all putting out, some higher rates like you did earlier in 2017, I mean there wasn't a ton of movement",neg,train
And one of the things has been - you are making sure rates are competitive for the long-term,neg,train

And that's really the only thing that I'm seeing that I would call is unusual in that business lines,neg,test
But when you do that and the relational aspect of it gives you the kind of deposit cost,neg,train
"You just mentioned at 11 basis points, which is not because we're paying under market is everyone knows, we're aggressive and in the market with our relationship really because we got so many transactional accounts quarter - accounts in that way",neg,train
So you know it's all that news forward and that's what we're really doing is just focused on relationships,neg,train

"70% and 21% statutory tax rate been in effect, our net interest margin percentage for the quarter would have been 3",neg,train
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the quarter was flat at 4,neg,train
"However, excluding the third quarter tax exempt loan correction that I mentioned earlier, the yield would have been up 4 basis points",neg,train
"At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr",neg,train
"Greg Parker, Executive Vice President and Director of Investor Relations",neg,train
Please see the last page of the text in this morning's earnings release for additional information about the risk factors associated with these forward-looking statements,neg,train
"If needed, a copy of the release is available at our website or by calling the Investor Relations department at 210-220-5632",neg,train
"And then back to that first answer you gave in terms of yours have been reinvesting or if you care to put a number around it, what percentage of that tax relief do you think gets put back to the business?",neg,train
Recent gains in the Texas leading index suggest that the positive momentum from the second half of the year should carry forward into 2018,neg,train
"Based on that forecast, about 350,000 new jobs would be added in Texas this year",neg,test
"We have had dislocation in price after the rate increase that we did, bought back 100 million shares in that program and then added right after that $150 million program for a couple years, so we've got that in place using",neg,train
We will use it if we feel like it's in the Company's best interest,neg,train
Jerry Salinas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
Energy sector employment grew 9% and manufacturing employment grew 2,neg,train
8% after two previous years of contraction in both sectors,neg,train
The Dallas Fed Texas business outlook surveys suggest continued growth in the state manufacturing and service sectors,neg,train
"9%, up slightly from November, but still one of the lowest levels on record",neg,test
"We have occasionally, but I would say rarely, do an acquisition",neg,train
That's not the key focus of what we are doing right now,neg,test
Key focus of what we are doing is in organic growth,neg,train
"As you're growing loans in high single-digits and our deposit growth has been, say mid single-digit",neg,train
You are going to end up spending your regulatory risk-based capital faster than you're spending your leverage ratio if you will,neg,train
I think we are doing a nice job with it,neg,train
"We've increased through 24, whatever have been in the years",neg,train
"Overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the fourth quarter were only 82 basis points of period end loans, a number well within our standards and one of the lowest totals in more than two years",neg,train
"Total problem loans, defined as risk grade 10 and higher were flat compared to the third quarter",neg,train
"Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas for some additional comments",neg,train
And our next question now comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos from JPMorgan,neg,train
Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter was $7 million compared with $6,neg,train
"For the past six quarters, we've experienced near normal levels of charge-offs and we expect this trend to continue",neg,train
Fourth quarter annualized net charge-offs represent just 22 basis points of average loans,neg,test
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Ebrahim, I think we expect consistency of what we've been doing",neg,train
I'm very optimistic about future execution and I don't want to change what we're doing,neg,train
"And what we're doing as we've got balanced growth, and as we talked about",neg,train
I'm just curious how do you guys think about the potential capital deployment from here with 2018 effective tax rate being lower and the possibility for regulatory relief coming up? Any color on the topic of capital deployment would be appreciated,neg,train
"So if you looked that, the third quarter to the fourth quarter, so our total interest bearing deposits went cost of - total interest bearing deposits went from 15 basis points to 19 basis points and our total deposit costs went from 9 basis points to 11 basis points",neg,train
So it is good to get to see that change in tax law,neg,train
"We're just running a business here and just as business people a change like that helps us and makes it easier to invest in that business, and that's what I believe we're also seeing and hearing from a lot of our customers",neg,test
"Got it, and then switching to expenses, I think if I back out some of the one off type items you called out about $192 million in expenses, implies about 4% to 5% year-over-year expense growth",neg,train
"Just curious with tax reform, does that have any impact on your strategy of holding such a high level of muni securities?",neg,train
"So closer to 5% on the full sort of reporter expense number, understood",neg,train
Thank you very much and congrats on the 150th Anniversary,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities,neg,train
1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $11 million in the third quarter,neg,train
"3 million in the fourth quarter, a slight increase from the total of $150 million in the third quarter",neg,train
The increase was basically attributable to one credit to longtime customer that it seems to operations,neg,test
[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America,neg,train
"1% of our account openings came from our online channel, which includes our Frost Bank mobile app",neg,train
That maintains our pace of more than double the level of the same quarter a year-ago,neg,train
"To put this in perspective, this is larger than our energy portfolio",neg,train
"And then one follow-up, other fee income it was elevated in the third quarter and then the fourth quarter came in a little bit higher",neg,train
I'm just wondering what drove the increase and is a more normal run rate what we saw in the first half of 2017?,neg,train
"Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $11",neg,train
7 billion during the fourth quarter down about $600 million from the third quarter average of $12,neg,train
The decrease was impacted by the sale of $750 million in treasury securities that occurred late in the third quarter,neg,train
The taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 4,neg,train
94% for the previous quarter and was impacted by the sale of the treasury securities last quarter that had a yield of 1,neg,train
Phil talked about some of the things that we're going to grow the business,neg,train
"We're good stewards of expenses, but to grow the business, it takes expenses",neg,train
So I think your higher end year-over-year sort of growth based on the reported number,neg,test
I would say is probably closer to kind of put our expectations are,neg,train
The interstate 35 corridor markets continue to leave the state,neg,train
The Austin economy is the fastest growing major metro area with extremely low unemployment,neg,train
6% job growth in 2017 was the best among the state's major metro areas,neg,train
"The top growing sectors in the fourth quarter were leisure and hospitality, professional and business services",neg,train
"As you may have seen in the press release, Frost is celebrating the 150th anniversary of its founding this year",neg,train
"Banks, especially Texas Banks, don't get to be 150 years old, unless they succeed in helping their customers to succeed, and by making people's lives better in the areas where they do business",neg,train
Those positive customer experiences are reflected and the recognition we received from third parties like J,neg,train
"As we've discussed in previous quarters, Frost is building on momentum in the markets that we serve and we are seeing increased optimism among our customers",neg,train
I think that we're always looking at all kinds of alternatives,neg,train
So the people that do that for us regularly propose a lot of different things and then in our team regularly that's it,neg,train
You got the same people basically sitting on that HELCO committee that have been there for years,neg,train
"Yes, I think our projections would say about the same, yes",neg,test
"Okay, and then you guys did a good job of breaking out some of the asset yield, somewhat happened linked quarter",neg,train
"Phil, can you maybe give us an update on any fluctuations in your funding costs in the fourth quarter?",neg,train
"Finally, outstanding energy loans at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $1",neg,train
The increase is split between increased customer activity in the energy sector and some quality customer acquisitions,neg,train
Our current level compares to our peak of 16% in 2015,neg,train
Like what happened to non-interest bearing deposits –interest bearing deposits?,neg,train
"On the commercial side, new loan opportunities are up 28% compared with last year",neg,train
"For 2017, new commitments under $10 million accounted for 47% of the total volume for the full-year, the efforts that our bankers have been putting into this or paying off extremely well",neg,train
No doubt that we have pressure from gross profit from supplier consolidation,neg,train
We do have a significant amount of unremitted foreign earnings which totaled approximate $3,neg,train
We are still gathering and analyzing necessary information on our unremitted foreign earnings and associated foreign tax credit but due to tax reform we currently expect to incur a material one time income tax charge on our historical unremitted foreign earnings that will be paid over the next eight fiscal years beginning in fiscal 2019,neg,train
Assumptions related to our third quarter and full year fiscal 2018 can be accessed in our earnings press release or 8-K filing at our website www,neg,train
Now let's take a further look at organic revenue growth by region,neg,train
9% year-over-year in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 respectively,neg,train
"When you exclude the negative impact of supplier program changes, our adjusted organic growth was 8",neg,train
These growth rates compares favorably to our fiscal 2017 organic growth and overall market growth,neg,test
"On a sequential basis, the Americas region have the most significant improvements as year-over-year reported growth improved from a decline of 16% in September quarter to a decline of roughly 6% in the December quarter",neg,train
"Although we are already been selling a lot of components in IoT applications, we felt the addition of new services and solutions would accelerate our growth by reaching more potential customers",neg,train
"Over the past year, we built our core team within the company augment with new hires from outside of Avnet to further enhance our go-to-market strategy",neg,train
We showcased many of the results at this effort in the consumer electronic show already this month including our IoT connect platform,neg,train
"IoT connect which utilizes the enterprise grade Microsoft Azure hybrid cloud, the data distribution and analysis that provides customers with a single go to software platform to support the complex communication, device and data management capabilities required to deliver IoT solution",neg,train
This allows our customers to incorporate any hardware platform when they address their Edge enterprise requirement,neg,train
"By collaborating with a broad cross section of our supplier base, we developed an extensive selection of smart, market ready connectivity solutions to tackle business challenges common to many industrial verticals including manufacturing, medical, environmental, retail and the smart city",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"No, I can share -- it wasn't our new supplier",neg,test
It really most of our current suppliers so they have a similar technology,neg,train
We don't have any one supplier apart from maybe an FBGA supplier that is excludes from the technology standpoint,neg,train
Some of the size we moved to different model or change their line card or their channel strategy,neg,train
We just double down our resources with them and as they did back with us,neg,train
Ken will go over more financial details later in the call,neg,train
"However, I want to give you some highlights of our achievements in electronic components Americas region this quarter",neg,train
"As discussed in our October call, the Americas region which was disproportionately impacted by supplier program changes, as well as their ERP disruption has brought about and many other metrics were beginning to improve",neg,train
"This quarter, I am happy to report that the continued upward trend in performance metrics is having a positive impact on the Americas regions financial performance",neg,train
Year-over-year reported revenue growth improved from a declined of 16% in the September quarter to the decline of 5,neg,train
Good morning and welcome to Avnet's Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 Business and Financial Update,neg,train
As we provide the highlights for our second quarter fiscal year 2018,neg,train
"Please note that in the accompanying remarks we have excluded certain items including ERP accelerated depreciation, intangible, asset amortization expense, restructuring, integration and other items and certain discrete income tax adjustments from all periods covered in our non-GAAP results",neg,train
"I don't have that one right in front for me but we will get that offline, we will have it for you later",neg,train
Now I'd like to provide you an update of the four pillars o Avnet's business strategy starting with our unique end-to-end ecosystem,neg,train
"io and manufacturing solution provider Dragon innovation, provides a low cost model to reach a wider base of engineers, makers and startups earlier in the design phase",neg,train
"In this December quarter, our community members grew nearly 10% sequentially and 42% year-over-year",neg,train
"We continue to make progress integrating leading handoffs within the digital ecosystem with a strong and rapidly growing customer opportunity pipeline, which is up 40% this quarter",neg,train
Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi,neg,train
I'll say few comments and let Phil want to chime in as well,neg,train
It means that we've -- sockets that we lost we will now replace them with design registration with other supplier on our line card,neg,train
"However, as you know, it takes anywhere from 6 months to 18 months to convert design registration into a design win and get the revenue for it",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
With respect to our long range planning target it haven't changed what we gave you last quarter was by 2020 we expect somewhere between 4,neg,train
5% or 5% operating income margin so that's remain the same,neg,train
"If you look at Premier Farnell, we had improvement there, we bought the property, and it was in 67% operating income range now it is closer to 10% range",neg,train
"In the December quarter, working capital decreased approximately $6 million sequentially",neg,train
An inventory increase is offset by a reduction in receivables and an increase in payable,neg,train
The increase in inventory represents additional investments related to a strong book-to-bill and extending lead time to support the seasonally strong growth in the Western region in the March quarter,neg,train
"When you exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate, working capital decreased $25 million on sequential basis and increased $467 million year-over-year",neg,train
"When we refer to constant currency or the impact of foreign currency, we mean the impact due to the change in foreign currency exchange rates when translating Avnet's non-U",neg,train
"When we refer to organic sales, we have adjusted the prior period to include the impact of acquisitions",neg,train
"In addition, when addressing return on capital employed, return on working capital and working capital velocity, the definitions are included in the non-GAAP financial information section of our earnings press release available on website at www",neg,train
"Based on this revenue forecast, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $0",neg,train
We have also increased our fiscal 2018 outlook from annual revenue in the range of $18,neg,train
The increase in fiscal 2018 guidance represents an approximately 2,neg,train
2% increase in revenue and 3% in adjusted diluted EPS as compared to the midpoint of prior guidance,neg,train
And then just regarding the operating margin opportunities going forward to that 4,neg,train
"5 plus, is that primarily improvements from North America? It sounds like by region North America maybe actually the lower of the three regions",neg,train
Philip Gallagher - Member of Executive Board & President of Electronic Components,neg,train
For the demonstration of the breadth of our line card and as Phil pointed out that we don't have any gap,neg,test
We actually have the ability to be able to shift pretty quickly with respect to our design resources,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James,neg,train
I'd also point out that in our guidance also include the nice sequential improvement operating income margin,neg,test
We went up 41 basis points versus the historic range and 35 to 45,neg,train
And I think that's consistent with electronics components historic performance with the experience of the mix shift to higher margin western region,neg,train
"So I'll give you a little bit color on, our thoughts on the seasonality",neg,test
Bill Amelio to discuss Avnet's second quarter fiscal 2018 business highlights,neg,train
"Regarding the recent US tax law changes from a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our adjusted effective tax rate for the December quarter remain within our previous guidance",neg,train
Our current mix of taxable income comes mostly from our foreign operation due to our corporate and interest expenses being primarily US based and due to the recent challenges experiences in Americas business,neg,train
"In the near term, we do not expect the significant impact on our December quarter adjusted effective tax rate as a result of US tax reform",neg,train
As the new US tax rate approximate our current blended effective tax rate in foreign jurisdiction,neg,train
We usually don't break it out in that sort of detail,neg,train
I'd tell you what we think overall as guidance; we are roughly in line with what we think the seasonality is,neg,train
So I am just call -- I don't think you are going to give a change in seasonality,neg,train
"As you know, we are a different business than we were a couple of years ago",neg,test
Our next question is come from the line of Shawn Harrison with Longbow,neg,train

"In the EMEA region, when you exclude the impact of supplier program changes, year-over-year growth in constant currency slowed to nearly 6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018",neg,test
After four consecutive quarters of double digit growth that averaged nearly 17%,neg,train
"In the Asia region which is now offset the impact of supplier program changes, organic revenue increased 10% year-over-year in constant currency and over 15% when you exclude the impact of supplier program changes",neg,train
"With the EMEA and Asia region having offset the impact of supplier program changes and the Americas region improving steadily, we are confident that our growth initiative are ramping and we are expecting to drive further improvement going forward",neg,train
"First, there was an inventory build sequentially and even year-over-year it was even more significant on a dollars basis",neg,train
"That was sort of surprising to me given the number one, you are improving what was the main issue right that you've improved this ERP implementation, you normally expect to see inventories coming to a more tame situation so are shortages influencing that or something else -- what's causing this?",neg,train
So my question would be organic growth is accelerated sequentially from about 2% to 1% despite what seems to be an otherwise pretty positive or healthy demand environment and what you mentioned we are improving declines in the Americas,neg,train
Can you help us to define the dynamics in the quarter and maybe the weakening you are seeing in the EMEA region in terms of your expectation they are going forward,neg,train
I'd add to that Adam that the highlight that we've added six new franchises in electronics component this quarter and we experienced this regional coverage of additional four suppliers and at Premier Farnell we added nine new franchises,neg,train
So I think we are gaining momentum when it comes to the suppliers,neg,train
Wanted to start first about he linearity of I guess the remaining cost cuts,neg,train
How is that split between the margins in June quarters?,neg,train
"I think it's more of predictability of seasonality is still kind of shifting target but we think that it is in line with what we are seeing right now and if we see a strong Q3 and have to change that and get to Q4 guidance we will, but right now we feel good with the range we've given",neg,train
Our track record is kind of being coming in the higher end of that range but we feel pretty confident right now,neg,train
It seems to be that the implied guide for Q4 is little bit below historically what you have done in terms of normal seasonality,neg,train
I know there was comment earlier that it's different now,neg,train
Does this just fit into that narrative of the seasonality being different today given all the changes in last year or two? Or does it reflect some incremental conservatism or anything else?,neg,train
Thank you for taking the time to be with us and your interest in Avnet,neg,train
We build on our progress that we made in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as revenues came at a high end of guidance,neg,train
Our adjusted EPS exceeded guidance in both gross profit and adjusted operating margin increased from the September quarter,neg,train
When combined with continued growth in EMEA region help offset the supplier program changes as electronic components revenue increased 4% year-over-year and 10,neg,train
2% year-over-year when you exclude the impact of those channel shifts,neg,train
Just following up on that question regarding this current business environment,neg,test
"If you look at your guidance, it actually looks like you are seeing accelerated organic growth above seasonal",neg,train
So could you give us an idea of what you are expecting per region relative to normal seasonality?,neg,train
"Well, and you mentioned in the Americas and ERP and hey we are still working through the right",neg,train
We are helping all the industries that we track and that you track,neg,train
"Our book-to-bill is solid, in case we got to grow -- it's perfect inventory, they support the book-to-bill in the backlog we have going to the March June quarter",neg,train
So we feel pretty good with the inventory level right now by the way,neg,test
And we don't see them increasing in the March quarter by any stretch of the imagination,neg,train
It's really there just to support the growth and the lead time issue as well as Bill mentioned to boost implementation ERP in Europe,neg,test
Now I'd like to turn the commentary over to Ken to provide more color on our financial performance,neg,train
And then can you provide a little bit more color on just the exact level of growth in terms of design wins and how it compared to maybe the last quarter or two?,neg,test
"In our December quarter, reported revenue grew nearly 6% year-over-year while organic revenue increased nearly 2% in constant currency",neg,test
"When you exclude the negative impact of the previously announced supplier program changes, revenue would have increased 7",neg,train
"Our Hardware Studio, collaboration between Avnet, Dragon Innovation and Kickstarter provides resources and support for independent hardware creator, had a well attended boost at a recent consumer electronic show",neg,train
"Before we get started with the presentation from Avnet management, I would like to review Avnet's Safe Harbor statement",neg,train
This call contains certain forward-looking statements which are statements addressing future financial and operating results of Avnet,neg,test
There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements,neg,train
More detailed information about these and other factors are set forth in Avnet's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,neg,train
"Steve, I don't have that data point in front of me but we will give you it one way",neg,train
"In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, cash generated from operating activity was $69 million",neg,train
"During the first six months of fiscal 2018, we received approximately $125 million from the sale of Tech Data stock which was acquired from the divesture of our technology solution business",neg,train
We used the proceeds to repurchase $139 million or 3,neg,train
The remaining $125 million of Tech Data shares will be sold after lockup period expires during the March quarter and will be used to repurchase shares through the remainder of fiscal 2018,neg,train
"Entering the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we had approximately $460 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization",neg,train
We ended the quarter with $590 million of cash of which $570 million was outside of the US,neg,train
We expect to generate operating cash flow through the remainder of fiscal 2018 from a combination of operating income and disciplined working capital management,neg,train
As we remained committed to value base management and achieving the right balance between earnings and return,neg,train
So what we did was we profile the industry and we looked and said okay where this Premier Farnell stack up with respect to SKU counts versus where they compete against and we were short,neg,train
"So what we did was we analyzed where the highest runners were and we are systematically putting those higher runners and we are continuing to add as long as we see that there is a payback and return and as you see with the growth out of Premier Farnell and increased profitability, it's a good bet for us",neg,train
"So I'd give you this kind of number as far as you can't go, in half a year we added about 50,000 SKUs to give roughly like number",neg,train
"Finally, we recently announced a key addition to our leadership with the appointment of Tom Liguori, our new CFO",neg,train
I'll give you a little color and I'll let Phil jump in as well,neg,train
Couple things that we -- definitely things that we've done,neg,train
One for example we expands SKU count and the inventory in Premier Farnell now as you would recall if you profile that versus their nearest competitors we didn't have as many as SKUs now we are adding more in order for us to gain more business and we will get a big pay off for that,neg,train
I just wanted to circle back to the earlier question on supplier dynamics and pressure,neg,train
I think you previously mentioned that the changes from TI are going to be out of the model by the end of calendar 2017,neg,train
"So just wanted confirm that is still the case and maybe for Phil, what are you seeing from other suppliers? I think you mentioned in the prepared comments you actually had some upside to margin in the quarter due to payment of a supplier program and margin in the core business in the western region improved so it doesn't sound to me like other suppliers are moving to pressure price or reduce margin",neg,train
We are just seeing -- we are seeing generally good organic growth right,neg,train
Our next question is come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs,neg,train
"The fourth pillar of strategy, right sizing the cost structure of Avnet is also about preparing Avnet for the future",neg,train
The combination of the divesture of technology solutions at the acquisition of Premier Farnell and supplier program changes required to us reconsider how we both run and support the business across the enterprise,neg,test
"We expect to realize a $120 million of annual savings by streamlining our structure, eliminating redundancies and centralizing certain function",neg,train
And we also in an execution phase on several initiatives and Ken will update you on the progress later on a call,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Colby with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
We've also begun to achieve some of the financial target as supplier built incentives around which partially contributed to 35 basis points sequential improvement in gross profit margin in the Americas regions of electronics component,neg,train
"The combination of sequential growth, gross profit margin expansion and cost reductions led to a significant improvement in operating margins for the September quarter",neg,train
Just one follow up on the guidance particular the EPS guidance,neg,train
I think you are implying operating profit dollar or kind of somewhere in $1,neg,test
I maybe missing something below the operating line so please correct me if I am wrong,neg,train
But why wouldn't we see more of a decline in the June quarter based on the implied revenue decline,neg,train
I don't think regional mix is typically favorable and it seems like there is little incremental cost cuts,neg,train
So just trying to understand the expectations and linearity to the back half of the year for profit dollars,neg,train
I think the company took up its revenue guidance by $400 million at the midpoint,neg,train
"Can you help us better understand what the key drivers are? Is there incremental $400 million versus company's prior expectation? And if any of that is going from the Marvell win that the company talked about last quarter, or if not shifting this year what should we think about that comment?",neg,train
"Europe - Europe continued to be strong, and as for last question that the Bill commented on, we are lapping on our comp at this point in Europe but definitely we see positive, continued positive in the March quarter",neg,train
"In Asia Pac, even with Chinese New Year, okay, the outlook in Asia is looking very positive",neg,train
"So I think I don't want to be - -and it's tough to define what seasonality is or with all the business change and the climate changes, the application to the market, I think we got to look in the venture if I got to readjust some of our own seasonality based on the new model we have moving forward",neg,train
"All regions really, really good at this point in time",neg,train
"First question, you mentioned that you have added SKUs to Premier Farnell and you also mentioned I think it was 9 suppliers that joined the Premier Farnell for their line card source, hoping to get just a little bit more color",neg,train
"How much can you give on in terms of how much this SKUs account went up, how much just from using internal relationship at the cross Premier Farnell and how much was related to some of these new suppliers",neg,train
"First, if you take out the supplier impact that we have we grew at the company at 7",neg,train
8% so that's I think an important metric to look at,neg,train
So when you normalize that it would be six suppliers we had a pretty healthy growth,neg,train
"Regarding EMEA specifically, look, we had 18 quarters of growth in EMEA, we have now lapped double digit growth year so it's not surprising that it has come down a little bit but that's -- I would still say EMEA is on fire for us and we were taking share, we've been able to win lots of customers and will replacing all the sockets that we've lost with respect to some of the supplier dislocation",neg,train
So we are pretty bullish around what's going on in EMEA,neg,test
1 and in some cases I'd say the average of a company about 1,neg,train
16 so really healthy outlook for the business right now,neg,train
So we are pretty excited about with the future of product,neg,train
"I would say that one thing is to think about it is on your OpEx line, do have some FX impact there and then you have the volume as well",neg,train
So those two things are driving up a little bit,neg,train
You are right that historically it is up and then there is still some net savings there from the cost reduction actions we talked about,neg,train
"Adjusted operating expenses of $457 million increased $35 million from the year ago quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Premier Farnell and changes in foreign currency exchange rates",neg,test
"Sequentially, operating expenses decreased $14 million, or nearly 3% on a reported basis",neg,train
"Of the $14 million sequential reduction, approximately $10 million is attributable to our cost reduction initiative for an annualized impact of $40 million",neg,train
"Since exiting our previous fiscal year, the quarterly operating expense run rate has been reduced by nearly 4% or $18",neg,train
This reduction trend is net of the increase in operating expenses incurred as a result of year-over-year organic sales growth,neg,test
Our reduced operating expense in December quarter further demonstrates our commitment to accelerating our cost reduction initiative,neg,train
And 60% of our $140 million of annualized cost saving has been achieved in the first half of fiscal year with the remaining savings to be realized in the second half of fiscal 2018,neg,train
"I would say currency is driving a little bit, the rate went up but we also have fair amount of what the dollar sales in Europe",neg,train
So there are some little bit of washing of FX because although there are some declines and some improvements because of the stronger euro so I don't think it's biggest driver of that,neg,train
We generally don't like to talk specifically to suppliers and they are still great supplier for us moving forward no doubt,neg,test
"As far as the model change, the common question we have, no, we don't see other suppliers following through",neg,train
"As a matter fact with some of the other changes we have had to our line card, we see other suppliers really doubling down with us on demand generation registration to design wins I think we noted in the script",neg,train
"Actually where we have had model changes or line card changes, we replaced all those sockets, and the number sockets in registration and design wins now we know the gestation period of taking of anywhere from 8 months to 18 months for us to see that revenue come back into play",neg,train
But we feel really confident where we are at today and never comfortable but really confident in where we are today with the current supplier base,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust,neg,train
"No, most of were actually -- it is the relationship from Premier Farnell and Avnet",neg,train
Some of that works from Avnet but most of it from Premier Farnell,neg,train
"With that improvement do you think you can get back up to those historical ranges in a 4%? Or I guess the concern is with the vendor consolidation or the chip consolidation, is pricing and margin a little bit different than they what have been in historically?",neg,train
I guess I would say that it's more back loaded to the June quarter and we got about 60% so I would say kind of directionally you get another 15% in the third quarter and then the remaining 25% in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"And then if I may follow up, you just touched on this briefly earlier and then in the prepared remarks, the new sockets one that comment that essentially saying those that have left at and now you found other suppliers now let's replace those",neg,train
And you are at a point of ramping just fulfillment revenue or was the comment on your design registration associated with that business,neg,train
Just trying to get better triangulation of kind of what those comments actually mean to revenue growth let say,neg,train
"In just a few moments, Bill Amelio, Avnet's CEO, will provide Avnet's second quarter fiscal year 2018 highlights",neg,train
"Following Bill, our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ken Jacobson, will review some additional financial highlights and provide third quarter and full-year fiscal 2018 guidance",neg,train
"Also here today to take any questions you may have related to Avnet's business operations is Phil Gallagher, President, Electronic Components",neg,train
Many of the individuals in Europe work on the EBV ERP will now transition to the team that is designing our Americas ERP system,neg,train
Thanks for that and for my follow up question and I am hoping just to better understand the SG&A dollars for the March quarter,neg,train
"I think traditionally in the March quarter is maybe $5 up $10 million or so or some years you may have a little bit more than that, but with incremental cost cuts that are coming, I have been expecting it to be relatively flat",neg,train
"But when I try back it into the guidance, it seems like maybe SG&A dollars are more like $15 million to $20 million sequentially",neg,train
So maybe just help me understand the SG&A line a little bit better and maybe trade-offs around gross margin so we can better understand the guidance,neg,train
"Thank you very much and congratulation to you and your team there, really nice to -- nice to see the turnaround and profitability in sales",neg,train
"A quick question, you posted for the December quarter operating margin in your EM group of about 3",neg,train
"That is down year-over-year, of course you had some chip suppliers leave as well as some chip suppliers coming in ERP system and such and you also have restructuring going on",neg,train
Our next question is comes from line of Steven Fox with Cross Research,neg,train
"Adjusted operating income of $146 million increased nearly $4 million from the September quarter and adjusted operating income margin was up 17 basis points, primarily due to improvements in the Americas region of electronic component as well as increase at Premier Farnell",neg,train
"From a foreign cash repatriation standpoint, we are currently evaluating the foreign tax implication of repatriating excess foreign cash",neg,train
"For working capital purposes, we believe we need between $200 million to $250 million of foreign cash on hand to run our foreign businesses",neg,train
"Ken Jacobson - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Controller",neg,train
I would say you are in the ballpark from an operating income perspective,neg,train
And I guess how I would characterize it is I think they typically from an EPS perspective from a Q3 to Q4 or second March and June quarter we have typically been around flattish not a significant decline so two point about the cost cut being some -- the rest of the back half loaded that kind of make up some of the lower GP from available decline,neg,train
Our end-to-end ecosystems are prime example of this effort as digital revenues now exceed $800 million on annual run rate basis,neg,train
"While we are still early in the cutover, I am pleased to report that through the first three weeks of January, we are on track in meeting all critical deliverable",neg,test
"I would now like to turn the floor over to Vince Keenan, Avnet's Vice President of Investor Relations",neg,train
"Okay and then just very last question if you could, just give us a sense when you look at the guidance for the full year now versus prior, how much exactly was related to currencies on the top line versus 90 days ago?",neg,train
"Avnet Inc (NYSE:AVT) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
Adjusted operating income declined nearly $19 million and adjusted operating income margin declined 63 basis points year-over-year as the addition of a full quarter Premier Farnell was offset by the negative impact of supplier program changes,neg,train
78 exceeded the high end of guidance and increased $0,neg,train
"02 sequentially, primarily due to improvements in the Americas region for both electronics components and Premier Farnell",neg,train
And most of that was by leveraging existing relationships that Avnet already had?,neg,train
I was wondering if you could tell us what book-to-bill was in the quarter,neg,train
I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments,neg,train
This quarter we leveraged our nearly two year relationship with AT&T and introduced a new system on module IoT solution powered by AT&T IoT services that provides a complete development environment for both prototyping and production of sensor to cloud application and services,neg,train
"From exclusive startup kit to production ready module, Avnet is working with AT&T to bring evolving LTE technology to market",neg,test
"We also recently announced a significant collaboration with Not Impossible Labs, an innovative leader in the maker and startup community committed to creating technology for the sake of humanity",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel,neg,train
But clearly Americas is an important part of recovery of our [OI] percent but it's also these four pillars that I described impact every one of the businesses across,neg,train
So every one of the regions and business unit across Avnet,neg,train
"At Premier Farnell, which is acquired in mid October of fiscal 2017, organic revenue grew 12",neg,train
Gross profit of $602 million increased $16 million or 2,neg,train
"8% year-over-year, primarily due to a full quarter of Premier Farnell result in the second quarter of fiscal 2018",neg,train
"3% increased 18 basis points sequentially, primarily due to improvements in the western region of electronic component",neg,test
7% year-over-year driven by double digit growth in our Asia region,neg,train
Our cost reduction initiative continue to gain traction as operating expenses declined $40 million or 2,neg,train
"9% sequentially, which contributed to a 17 basis points sequential increase in adjusted operating income margin",neg,test
Our second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings press release can be accessed at a downloadable PDF format at our website www,neg,train
The important thing is we expect these savings not only to improve our financial performance but also allow us to reinvest more of our gross profit dollars back into the business,neg,train
"The technology market we serve are going through rapid changes as combination of the internet, new software tool, higher speed network and standard based designs are expanding number of potential customers and products we support",neg,train
"Disappointingly but somewhat expected, the net interest margin decreased 14 basis points for the quarter to 3",neg,train
The yield on interest earning assets decreased 4 basis points for the quarter primarily driven by an 8 basis point decrease in load yields to 4,neg,test
"49% for the fourth quarter, which excludes held for sale loans, the majority of which are re-recognized Ginnie Mae loans recorded in held for sale",neg,train
We're required to record Ginnie Mae loans that are 90 days delinquent and eligible to be repurchased by the bank even though we legally do not own these loans,neg,train
"4 million of negative valuation adjustments related to the mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, and $2",neg,train
1 million of an estimated net tax benefit as a result of re-measurement of the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities,neg,train
"After adjusting for these non-recurring items, our core number was closer to $0",neg,train
16 per diluted common share and we have provided a reconciliation on Slide 10 of our slide deck,neg,train
"Well that's – so there are several quick, but important comments around all that",neg,train
First of all from a regulatory perspective as you know we went over the $10 billion mark,neg,train
And that has a set of requirements and that are enhanced from a regulatory perspective and related costs,neg,train
With regard to just on the margin again here two things,neg,train
"One, where do you think the margin bottoms out in terms of the first half of this year? And then the second part, what are you assuming for interest rate hikes in your margin modeling?",neg,train
I don't think you're going to see increases to the same extent,neg,train
"So if you think about kind of the beta concept, the impact is going to be lower with future Fed rate hikes",neg,train
Our next question comes from Matthew Clark of Piper Jaffray,neg,train
So we decided to set about a program to exit these both high priced and high volatility deposits,neg,train
"The gap was such that we were going to have to use institutional funding, which of course is stable and reliable albeit high cost",neg,train
"So as we've said, we may not like the geography from an organic deposit standpoint, but the range of cost differential is modest",neg,train
"So the key here is to get to a deposit platform that is one organic, two stable, reliable, repeatable and three over time lower cost",neg,train
And we have to go through this last bit of a reduction that we mentioned to get to the core,neg,train
Our next question comes from Andrew Liesch of Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
"And then just directionally on the loan yields with the noise around the Ginnie Mae loans, but also you know the weighted average rate on new production at 4",neg,train
"I mean when you think about all the moving parts, I mean, directionally should we assume that that expands once again or not?",neg,train
So in the second half of the year conceivably the expense line item should go to zero,neg,train
So we're going to do the right thing around our multifamily book and our resi book,neg,train
So you'll see us a package up and sell from time to time,neg,train
But that gain on sale approach again will be a very modest certainly by comparison to anything here in the past,neg,train

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr,neg,test
"I believe we had about $225 million, $250 million of CLO calls for the quarter",neg,train
And so we had a net run-off of $120 million,neg,train
"The quarter continues to include a handful of non-recurring items impacting earnings, which John will detail later on the call",neg,train
These non-recurring expenses have lingered longer than we would like and looking into the New Year we expect a large part of them to diminish,neg,train
"Well, certainly on the CLOs we kind of control that run-down and we have a change of those instruments",neg,test
29% today on a blended basis and what we're seeing out there in the market in terms of new instruments coming on is somewhere in call at 3 to 3,neg,train
Interest income from residential loans declined to 22% down from 32% a year ago,neg,test
4 million and included $4 million loss on solar investments,neg,train
4 million and include a number of items that we did not consider to be core operating expenses,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Well let me take the back-end of the question first and that is to talk about the multifamily business,neg,train
So we went about a couple of quick but very important items here,neg,test
First of all Jason Pendergist joined us as Head of Real Estate Banking has a considerable background in the greater world of real estate,neg,train
And that's what's important in terms of what's going on in the multifamily space,neg,train
"More broadly, we are also adding a considerable talent to the C&I banking teams and to our private bank",neg,train
We reduced institutional bank deposits by $603 million driven by a planned reduction of high rate high volatility deposits resulting in $849 million of institutional bank deposits at year-end,neg,train
The remaining $250 million of high cost and high volatility deposits are expected to runoff in the near-term,neg,train
Our ALLL to total loans increased this quarter to 74 basis points up from 67 basis points a year ago,neg,train
"On the capital front, we continue to have more than adequate capital to fund our business with common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9",neg,train
"Before I turn it over to John, let me share a few thoughts of what I'm seeing across our markets since the last time we updated you",neg,train
"Okay, and then for the SBA, we had a pretty good run rate of what you would expect going forward outside of seasonal trends?",neg,train
The California based economy and our markets that real estate trends are all positive and as the six largest economy in the world offers good diversification in our businesses,neg,train
"So the growth that you're seeing is really a function of investing in our relationship managers, lifting out teams and not expanding the credit profile materially of the company",neg,train
Our next question is a follow up question from Jackie Bohlen of KBW,neg,train
No at this – yeah at this time we're just purchasing CLO,neg,train
"Good day, and welcome to the Banc of California Inc Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast",neg,train
"All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded",neg,train
Just a question around provisioning loan growth is certainly strong this quarter,neg,train
"If we continue to see loan growth north of 5%, 6%, 7% or at that level, I mean is this the right level of provisioning that we should be forecasting?",neg,train
Thank you for joining us for today's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call,neg,train
"Joining me on the call today are Banc of California’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Doug Bowers; Chief Financial Officer, John Bogler; and Chief Risk Officer, Hugh Boyle",neg,test
And just one last question just regarding tax outlook and the expense carry on the alternative energy partnerships,neg,train
I got your comments on the tax rate assumption for the year and how that might trend,neg,train
Can you give any color on magnitude wise where we should be thinking about the expense item?,neg,train
Security yields were flat from the prior quarter at 3,neg,train
The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 9 basis points to 1,neg,test
"21%, primarily due to an eight basis point increase in interest bearing deposit costs and a 10 basis point increase in FHLB borrowing costs",neg,train
"The increased FHLB borrowing costs were driven by both higher short-term rates on overnight advances, which totaled $1",neg,train
1 billion at year-end as well as increased interest expense as a result of $550 million of term advances put in place during the fourth quarter,neg,train
These longer-term advances are largely tiered over a one to four year period and are expected to improve our overall asset liability position,neg,train
The fourth quarter marked another series of steps on our journey towards building a more core and traditional commercial bank,neg,train
"However, we acknowledge the hard work ahead of us in 2018 and beyond to continue this transformation",neg,train
And we plan to share a few insights on these topics soon to help you see the direction we're headed in and how we intend to get there,neg,train
We truly have a great opportunity in front of us,neg,train
"Okay and that would trend – excluding the impact of the rate increase that would trend first quarter deposit cost up, am I understanding that correctly?",neg,train
"However, we are seeing reinvigoration of our banking teams and calling activities",neg,train
"Okay, but going forward we shouldn't expect to see similar level of increases from the future rate hikes",neg,train
"Yep, you’ll see some additional impacting that will flow through into the first quarter",neg,train
So the impact of what was undertaken in the fourth quarter is not fully reflected in the fourth quarter’s numbers?,neg,train
"And if you look at the securities book kind of on a core basis, so ex the CLO run-off, ex the MLP reduction and if you look at that core basis what’s the typical quarterly cash flow? What’s the yield of what's running off? And then what are you replacing that with?",neg,train
I wanted to follow up on one of your comments about bringing the earning asset base as effectively stabilized and it should begin to grow,neg,train
The prospective buyer is conducting diligence and we hope to arrive at a file agreement by early February with servicing transferred to the buyer early in the second quarter,neg,train
Average interest earning assets were flat from the prior quarter at $9,neg,train
"For the Ginnie Mae loans, these are loans that were sold to Ginnie Mae and under that program we have an obligation or they have the ability to put back to us loans that are delinquent 90 days or more",neg,train
"And so, as a result, the asset sits on the balance sheet, but we don’t have an associated yield",neg,train
"Net charge-offs for the quarter were $791,000 or 5 basis points annualized as a percentage of loans",neg,train
The allowance for loans and leaf losses increased to $49,neg,train
3 million and ALLL to total loans and leases ratio ended the quarter up 2 basis points to 74 basis points and covered 255% of non-performing loans,neg,train
Our capital position remains strong as the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9,neg,train
"9%, which is the highest as it has been in over three years",neg,train
All capital ratios well exceed Basel III fully phased-in guidelines,neg,train
"Additionally, our TCE capital ratio has increased 13% from a year ago to 6",neg,train
"3 million and included severance, lease termination expense, legal items and software write-off expenses",neg,train
1 million in line with our near-term target level of $60 million,neg,train
We are hopeful to be largely past these non-recurring expense items as we head into 2018,neg,train
"Our adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 75% for the quarter, which continues to reflect more of a revenue opportunity for us versus an absolute expense reduction opportunity",neg,train
We don't – look we don't breakout specific costs of those varying deposit buckets,neg,test
"Another item to note, given the strong loan growth, was the higher provision this quarter, which hurts us on the income statement in the period of origination",neg,train
1 million provision for loan losses while credit quality was relatively stable,neg,train
"With continued strong long growth, pre-tax pre-provision earnings power of the company will become increasingly important",neg,train
"The composition of interest income continues to improve as commercial loan interest income now represents 52% of total interest income, up from 41% a year ago",neg,train
"For them, we represent an opportunity to join a firm where they can make a meaningful difference and be an active partner in our success",neg,train
"As we move throughout the year, I look forward to sharing some of these stories and successes with you",neg,test
"We were able to replace and remix $290 million of non-brokered non-institutional bank deposits this quarter primarily through our commercial, retail and private banking areas",neg,train
"Although we're not able to fill the gap in one quarter alone, we have grown these deposits over the past three quarters and that growth accelerated in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"Non-brokered non-institutional banking deposits now account for 68% of total deposits, up from 52% at the end of the first quarter",neg,test
Broker deposit balance has increased by $202 million during the quarter as we backfill the remaining gap from the decline of institutional balances,neg,train
Our weighted average added to that – our weighted average coupon for the fourth quarter was 3,neg,train
"91% and that's down from the prior quarter, which is at 4",neg,test
"What I would note about that and as Doug talked a little bit about is Jason came on board at the end of the third quarter, so he's got his first full quarter under his belt and he's been hard at work implementing a retail strategy",neg,train
"91% was lower than the prior quarter, we would expect that on an absolute basis excluding even changes in general level of interest rates, we start to see that rate improve in the coming quarter",neg,train
"And then looking at the savings cost, the deposit of savings cost, up 22 basis points this quarter",neg,train
"I know you guys are running a promotion of 1% savings rate on balance of north of 100,000",neg,train
How much of that was negotiated? How much of that I guess is sensitive to future rate hikes? And you know how much are you paying up today to keep some of those core balances out the bank?,neg,train
This expense level is a result of both continued investment in front-line personnel namely added bankers and front-line deposit producers to drive deposit loan and revenue growth and realization of efficiencies in the back office and reduction of legacy expense items,neg,train
Strong credit continues to be a hallmark at Banc of California with non-performing assets to total assets of 21 basis points,neg,train
"Even though the NPA ratio moved up slightly from the third quarter, at these absolute low levels non-performers could bounce around a bit",neg,train
"(NYSE:BANC) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
"Today's conference call is being recorded, and a copy of the recording will be available later on the Company's Investor Relations website",neg,train
"We’ve also furnished a presentation that management will reference on today's call, and that presentation is also available on our website under the Investor Relations section",neg,train
"On the liability side, we continue to work hard on improving the funding profile of the company as we saw a modest decline in overall deposit balances as we purposefully brought down balances of high cost and high volatility deposits",neg,train
"Offsetting a portion of these declines were increased core business unit balances collectively from commercial, private and retail banking, which increased by $290 million and the gap was back filled with wholesale funding namely FHLB and broker deposits",neg,train
These sales continue to be aligned with our strategy to reduce the higher risk portions of the securities portfolio,neg,train
"The asset remix also includes growing held for investment loan balances, which in the fourth quarter increased by $433 million, or 7% from the prior quarter, or 28% annualized growth rate",neg,train
"Originated loan balances have increased by $500 million, or 9%, during the quarter and have increased by 21% from a year ago",neg,train
I want to come back to you to give you a better percent,neg,train
"Following up on Matt question on MSRs, the piece that’s been sold, is that the final Ginnie piece of it and would that sale done that line item should essentially be zero going forward? Or is this still part of the previously announced MSR sales?",neg,train
"Gross loan production totaled $969 million for the fourth quarter, which we defined as gross commitment originations and new production yields on average with 4",neg,train
"Net held for investment loan growth occurred across all of our key portfolios with multifamily growing by $198 million, residential mortgage growing by $135 million, C&I by $99 million and CRE by $11 million, consumer loans declined by $11 million during the quarter",neg,train
"And along the way, we're building out the deposit franchise to address it and we've also had degrees of success early going right now, but degrees of success of getting that underway as well",neg,test
"With that introduction, I'm pleased to turn it over to our CFO, John Bogler, to provide more details around our fourth quarter financial results",neg,train
"So for instance if I look at savings deposits, they were 115 basis points during the quarter, but you mentioned you had extended some duration on those ahead of the rate just to stabilize them",neg,train
"Commercial loans collectively increased by $308 million or 7% from the prior quarter and are up $680 million, or 18% from a year ago",neg,train
5 billion and represented 68% of the loan book up from 63% a year ago,neg,train
2 million of SBA loans at a gain of $1,neg,train
"On the deposit side, we continue to reduce our reliance on high cost and high volatility deposits as overall deposit balances declined by $111 million",neg,test
"I think the short answer is that we will be backfilling it substantially throughout the first quarter, but it's going to take a bit of time and we point to the progress that we had in the latter half of the year",neg,train
"And I think maybe too, it would be helpful to have a color here",neg,train
These legacy institutional bank deposits were both high priced and volatile,neg,train
"And while the world of institutional funding also has a high price, it does not have the degree of volatility that we were experiencing with these legacy deposits",neg,test
"Just touching on the deposit still, when I look at the quarterly averages on the rates, how do those compared to where you were at end of period for the various accounts buckets that you have?",neg,train
"Moving to credit metrics, asset quality and trends continue to be strong and stable",neg,train
"Our non-performing asset ratio for the quarter was just 21 basis points, up slightly from 16 basis points last quarter and a year ago",neg,train
"Given the absolute low level we are near, there could be some bouncing around from quarter to quarter",neg,train
It is important to know that these additional non-performing loans resulted in a minimal amount of new specific reserves as we believe these loans were adequately collateralized,neg,train
"As Doug noted, we are in the early stages of building a strong deposit franchise and recognize that our rate sensitive deposit and wholesale funding base will continue to put pressure on net interest margin",neg,train
Deposit costs are the single biggest opportunity we have to improve our margin over time,neg,train
"As we continue to implement increased pricing discipline on the asset side and launch the new deposit and treasury management platform, we expect NIM to stabilize during the first half of the year and begin a slow expansion thereafter",neg,train
So the securities that are being purchased to offset the run-off are still primarily CLOs or are you guys purchasing other securities as well?,neg,train
"Just on the – on your core deposits, how should – how do you think about or what is the kind of weighted average cost of the new core deposit you're bringing in the door? I am just trying to get a sense for where after you runoff all this non-core stuff and obviously we're dealing with higher rates in the interim",neg,train
But just trying to get a sense for can you kind of keep a lid on the deposit cost at some point here or not?,neg,train
Our next question is a follow up from Timur Braziler of Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
What's the cost of that $600 million slog that you view as core and [indiscernible]?,neg,train
"Look I think I appreciate the questions around the deposit, funding and costs",neg,train
We’ll have a lot more to say about that when we're together in early February in terms of outlook,neg,train
"As we think about the provision for the quarter, we posted $5",neg,train
3 million and the overall held for investment book grew by $433 million or so,neg,train
"If you think about in those terms, it's a 1% provision rate",neg,train
"As we look at our overall book of business and kind of the mix of production that's expected to come on, we would look for a provision rate that’s somewhere between 80 basis points to 100 basis points with probably a bias towards the lower end of that range",neg,train
"Employees will have a component of corporate financial performance objectives in addition to individual or business unit goals for production, balances, earnings and other metrics",neg,test
"At first blush, this may not sounds groundbreaking, but let me remind you this is a cultural change for this company and we expect that 2018 will be a big year for aligning compensation with performance across the organization",neg,train
"As we move throughout the year, we can share more detail with you around how we are thinking about incenting the right behaviors and activities",neg,train
"In terms of the expenses, we have one solar program that we're still investing in and the expense recognition is largely dependent upon them, the timing of the other party deploying the various solar panels",neg,train
"But I would expect that we would have expenses that somewhat near the tax credits that we receive, so they're largely offsetting",neg,train
"We'll certainly provide more color as we get together in the early part of February, but directionally you’ve got it correct",neg,train
I think you'll start to see some benefits on the yield side,neg,train
"Lastly, related to income taxes, we got a lot of questions on our outlook for tax rates and solar tax equity program",neg,train
"For 2018, it is likely that our effective tax rate for the full year will be substantially less than the full statutory rate",neg,train
"Given the level of our existing solar investment program, we expect our effective tax rate in the first half of the year to be minimal before reverting to a more normalized level in the second half of the year",neg,train
"As we finalize our plan and complete a full assessment of the recent tax reform program changes, we can share a tax rate expectation for the coming years",neg,train
"And now, I will turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Doug Bowers",neg,train
"Embedded within that, that savings account, we extended duration on about $125 million of deposits and extended that our for four year term",neg,train
So that’s certainly added to the increase that we saw during the quarter,neg,train
We also had some other deposit relationships where we were proactive in locking them down for a longer period of time and took action prior to the Fed rate increase to again keep those depositors for a longer period of time,neg,train
So there were some proactive actions that took place that caused those money market balance rates to increase,neg,train
No this is a new MSR sale and it encompasses the remaining Ginnie book as well as the small book of Freddie and Fannie that we're looking to sell,neg,train
So what should remain afterwards is our SBA MSR asset,neg,train

Non-interest income includes gains from the previously mentioned sales of MLP and bank debt securities,neg,train
"As part of our ongoing efforts to focus on core assets, we have a non-binding offer to sell the SFR agency related MSR asset, which covers approximately $3",neg,train
And again we're coming very close to arriving at a definitive agreement for the sale of the MSRs,neg,train
The impact of what was done within the fourth quarter that's not fully reflected in the fourth quarter’s numbers,neg,train
You'll see some flow through into the first quarter of that,neg,train
Okay and then maybe one more for me if I can,neg,train
"Well I’m just looking at the loan growth and the composition of it, certainly I am glad to see C&I balances for the growth rate accelerated over the last two quarters",neg,test
Is there any thought on maybe slow loan growth in this type of rate environment until the funding base is more stable? Or is the loan growth kind of an outcome of the production let alone the funding?,neg,test
"So if I understand correctly, there's about $250 million more of what you classify as high yield higher volume deposits that you expect to exit soon in the first half of 2018",neg,train
Is it possible to see deposit balances actually start to increase from a net basis starting in the first quarter? Or is that still going to be a little bit of too much of a bucket to the backfill?,neg,train
And then the increase in the yield on what you've been booking,neg,train
Was that mix driven or is that just general trends that you’re seeing in the market?,neg,train
"Interest income declined by $400,000 from the prior quarter to $97",neg,train
"2 million, driven by zero interest income on SFR pools in the fourth quarter and lower interest income on held for sale loans, which impacted interest income by $3",neg,train
"Additionally, interest income from securities and other assets was lowered by $1",neg,train
2 million while interest income on commercial and residential loans increased by $3,neg,test
"Now that we have moved past the sale of seasoned SFR loan pools, we would expect loan growth to drive interest income higher over time",neg,train
This is more apparent when you look at period end loan balances compared to average balances as late quarter fundings cost average balances to lag period end balances by $349 million and provide us with strong footings to start 2018,neg,train
"Transitioning to the income statement, net income available to common stockholders for the fourth quarter was $6",neg,train
"For continuing operation, earnings per diluted common share were $0",neg,train
These results included a number of items that we want to call to your attention,neg,train
I draw your attention to an 8-K that we filed with respect to the settlement of another litigation matter,neg,train
And what's important here is that first of all that it's settled and it's regards one of our former executives and I would also point out that from a reserve perspective we're pleased with our standing,neg,train
"And then just last one for me just looking at the securities portfolio, you know, last quarter you had said that over time you're looking to exit out of that CLO book still at $1",neg,train
Maybe just what’s the yield on that CLO portfolio and for the guidance that you provided on the margin or the broader outlook on margin kind of what your assumption as far as letting that roll-off? Is that going to occur naturally? Or are you guys hoping that to accelerate a little bit?,neg,train
"I just add to CLOs double A rated, C&I well performing and most on this call would know that there has been a considerable amount of early calls on that activity",neg,train
"So while our book is higher than our peer group, the performance of that asset class has been quite good",neg,train
Conceivably it should go to zero and then our effective tax rate would start to migrate of something,neg,train
"Over the past quarter, I've continued to spend substantial time out in our markets, meeting our people, visiting our clients and recruiting additional bankers to our business units",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timur Braziler of Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
I would like to turn the conference back over to Doug Bowers for any closing remarks,neg,train
The second thing I would do is kind of revert to the overall story here,neg,train
And we're seeing good pipelines and a good outlook as we come into the year,neg,test
Our big effort is centered additionally around the deposit side,neg,train
"And just finally last one for me, sorry to beat the dead horse",neg,train
But what were the actual CLO calls this quarter? So what was the actual reduction of CLOs from period to period? I know that net earnings was…,neg,train
Cautionary comments regarding forward-looking statements are outlined on Slide 1 of today's presentation which apply to our comments today,neg,test
I would look at that to be more of an ongoing event,neg,train
And so we potentially will have sales throughout each quarter of the year,neg,test
33% from continuing operations for the fourth quarter after adjusting for the non-recurring expense items,neg,train
We expect to be able to update you with more thoughts around our expense outlook when we share our strategic roadmap in early February,neg,train
"First, we further reduced our securities portfolio by $180 million including the runoff of $117 million of CLO holdings",neg,train
"We completed our exit of the remaining $23 million of bank debt during the quarter, which was sold for a gain of $744,000",neg,train
"Additionally, we sold $24 million of MLP debt or 22% of that portfolio at a gain of $1",neg,train
"That leaves us with $84 million of MLPs on the balance sheet, which are carried at a $7 million unrealized gain at year end",neg,train
We expect to exit the remaining MLPs over the first half of 2018,neg,train
We expect to be able to complete our investment commitment in the solar program in the first half of the year,neg,train
And so that's why we will have an effective tax rate that's closer to zero,neg,train
"And then once we've completed our investment, I would expect that that our effective tax rate would start to migrate up to something that's more of a normalized rate and for us what I would consider to be normalized rate is somewhere between 20% to 25% for an effective tax rate",neg,train
We are also looking at kind of our overall balance sheet mix and our production capabilities,neg,train
So we may have some gains on sale from those two product categories as we go throughout 2018,neg,train
"Right, so taking my earlier comment, we did take some action with respect to some of our retail deposit accounts in the money market account segment and we increase the rates proactively in advance of the Fed rate increase",neg,train
"With the exception of the money market, we did not take any sort of action with respect to the savings accounts in advance",neg,train
So we would expect to see some rate increase flow through as we move into the first quarter,neg,train
We are finalizing our budget and plan for 2018 as we speak,neg,train
Our plan is to provide an update the first full week of February to all of you,neg,train
"It looks like the majority if not all of the gain on sale income was from SBA in the quarter, I mean given the MSR sale that you're looking to do",neg,train
Non-performing assets to equity continued to remain strong at 2,neg,train
"Delinquent loan metrics remain strong and delinquent loans to total loans ratio declined from 1% a year ago to just 63 basis points in the fourth quarter, which is up slightly from the prior quarter’s 50 basis point level",neg,train
"However, I would note that after year-end, we have seen $16 million of these balances come current",neg,train
"And then just lastly, what percentage of your loan book reprices immediately as rates change?",neg,train
The makeup of our funding base today is inherently more wholesale than we would like and this does put pressure on the net interest margin and a rising rate environment and we need to improve our funding base,neg,train
The transformation of the funding profile of the bank from wholesale to increasingly core funded is the most important piece of our journey,neg,train
"And while these activities are underway, it will take time to complete this transition and demonstrate results",neg,train
"Thank you, Tim, and thank you everyone for joining our call today",neg,train
Let me kick off today's discussion by updating you on these five items,neg,train
"We saw strong loan originations in the quarter, which resulted in held for investment loan growth of $433 million, which was a 7% quarterly growth rate or 28% annualized",neg,train
"The CLO balance was about one point, my neighbor quick…",neg,train
"Yeah, I think that's within reason of why we would expect to see each quarter",neg,train
The yield – the book yield on that book of business is 3,neg,train
29% at the end of the quarter and so that's $1,neg,train
We did allow the runoff of about $120 million over the course of the fourth quarter,neg,train
We’ll continue to have some controlled runoff of that book of business,neg,train
There's frequent calls that occur within those types of securities and we still like the security instrument,neg,train
We just believe we have too high of a concentration in that investment security type,neg,train
"We won't necessarily run the balance down to zero over time, but we will get down to be a much smaller portion of the overall investment portfolio",neg,train
"And then just on the income statement, the loan servicing line, which I think had a MSR write-down of that $4",neg,train
"4 million in it, which gets you I think back to a $2 million kind of an adjusted number",neg,train
Anything else in there that's unusual or that’s a decent run rate…,neg,train
"Earnings were $502 million, up 13% and earnings per diluted share were $3",neg,train
"When we look at full-year operating results, Ameriprise achieved a new record, earnings were $1",neg,train
9 billion up 35% with earnings per share of $12,neg,test
3 billion which were very low fee fixed income mandates that had a weighted average fee rate of only four basis points,neg,train
So you’re not seeing any competitive pressures with people becoming more aggressive on pricing as a result of the tax benefit gains?,neg,train
And we have an answer on the question on performance fees,neg,train
The revenue is 34 billion and the PTI is 16,neg,train
"I guess, the easiest way to think it from my standpoint is, we’ve talked about it this particular environment situation that were generating 85%, 90% free cash flow",neg,train
At this stage you could assume that that will go up by somewhere between 150 million and 200 million,neg,train
"Again assuming the mix of businesses and things don’t change, just coming from the Tax Reform Act",neg,test
"Total is 32 for CLOs and for – what you call again, for performance fees to property, but the breakdown how much was in the revenue and how much was so on the expense side, I just don’t have that in front of me",neg,train
"Well, overall our fee base on the rate basis points, I’d say 2017 over 2016 is actually up, it's a combination of mix, some of the assets that we've added but also overall the assets that we managed or retain, which we do have a good portion, a good thing in equity",neg,train
We did lose a bit more in the fixed income side in net flow picture which has very low basis points for some of those institutional and parent activities,neg,train
"In Auto and Home, our changes are taking hold and we’re seeing good progress and results",neg,train
And our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi,neg,train
Expense growth was driven by higher distribution related expenses; G&A was elevated from the timing of performance-based compensation and the on-boarding of IPI,neg,train
"Adjusting for these items, G&A was up 5% year-over-year based upon continued investment for growth and volume related items",neg,train
"Variable annuities continue to be in outflows, similar to the industry and the trends we’ve seen over the past year",neg,train
We’ve seen an uptick in sales of a variable annuities product without living benefits,neg,train
Our non-living benefit product now comprises about a third of our sales up from 29% of sales last year,neg,train
And on the regulatory front we are managing a significant change of gender including MiFID II and preparing for Brexit,neg,train
4 billion including reinvest in dividends and the Limestone acquisition,neg,train
"Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance",neg,train
These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties,neg,test
"A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2017 earnings release, our 2016 annual report to shareholders, and our 2016 10-K report",neg,test
We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements,neg,train
"In addition, we achieved a new high return on equity at 32",neg,train
3% which is one of the best returns in financial services,neg,train
And Ameriprise has consistently grown these measures at a meaningful rate,neg,train
"My name is Paulette, and I will be your operator for today’s call",neg,test
[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded,neg,train
"I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity, you may begin",neg,train
Variable annuities earnings growth was 25% from strong equity markets with fixed annuities earnings being down to 14 million as expected,neg,train
Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair,neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

"And remember it's a combination of institutional and retail asset, so that's in OpEx",neg,train
"On a statutory basis this impacted our RBC ratio by about 40 percentage points, but the ratio remains quite strong at about 435%",neg,train
"Well, the new recruits coming in, our average productivity on them are actually pretty strong",neg,train
"They are actually above the average across our system right now, particularly in the employee channel",neg,train
But the nature on averages it takes two to three years for them to ramp up to their productivity,neg,train
"And so as an example if you look at our AAG platform which is the employee platform, you can see it more because the number of recruits there a bit higher against the base, but the productivity of the channel has grown nicely and so has the margins in that channel",neg,test
"We recently launched the Columbia adaptive retirement series, a unique product for the defined contribution market that incorporates our adaptive risk capability",neg,test
Our net amount at risk is exceptionally low relative to the industry,neg,train
As a percent of account value it is only 0,neg,train
Total annuity and our VUL/UL insurance balances were up due to equity market appreciation,neg,train
"Variable annuity sales overall have been at a slower pace consistent with the industry and essentially flat last year, however we continuing to see a nice pickup in sales of annuities without living benefits up 18% from a year ago",neg,train
We continue to serve our clients long-term financial security needs through our annuity and protection offerings,neg,train
"And we believe that is what the trend line is, yes, some",neg,train
"8 billion of capital to shareholders, which was 96% of our operating earnings",neg,train
As we move through 2017 our share price appreciated substantially,neg,train
We lowered our share repurchase levels and allocated some of those resources to acquisitions,neg,train
Ameriprise devoted considerable time and resources to ensure we were well prepared,neg,train
We kept our advisors focused on serving clients and running and growing their practices while managing significant regulatory changes,neg,train
"We estimate our ongoing effective tax rate to be between 17% to 19%, driving an improvement in our cash flow generation particularly in AWM and asset management",neg,train
Within two years we expect to earn back the charge taken in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"And then sticking with AWM, can you us, I know expenses were somewhat elevated in the quarter for comp and performance related reasons",neg,train
Can you help us think about what we should expect for G&A expense growth in AWM in 2018?,neg,train
"So over the course of the year, but over the course of the last number of years there's been a shift from commission-based business to fee-based accounts and that's definitely included for the fourth quarter, but we also seen greater inflow of client activity that has been going to the fee-based business",neg,train
"We still saw a very good transactional activity in the fourth quarter, so we didn’t see it as just a shift, we saw it as more client activity with a piece going to commission base, but more so on the trend line to the advised based, fee based business",neg,train
"In addition, we were again named the military friendly employer for the fourth year in a row, and the foundation for all of this our employees and advisors, our engagement with them is industry-leading, as it’s been for many years",neg,train
This was fuelled by our strong growth businesses where AWM and Asset Management earnings were up 28% and 27%,neg,train

"The answer to your question yes, it is driven by the tax reform",neg,train
The answer to the second part of the question is the RBC and the effectiveness and the required RBC is driven by the rating agencies,neg,train
To the best of my knowledge I have not given us any guidance that they will be changing what their required RBC will be,neg,train
And we have the ability and will be building back your RBC as we go through the year,neg,train
"On the product front, we continue to focus on our strategic products that are in high demand categories, and align with investor needs",neg,train
"We’ve had very good strong client activity, new client activity and flows in even where the money being deployed our cash balances are still very consistently high from the new cash flow coming in",neg,train
And our advisors are actually generating even nicer increase productivity,neg,train
And we’re actually going to do a bit more and helping the advisors grows this year,neg,test
"The way we work with and support our advisors, reflects the strength of our culture and why Ameriprise is so attractive in the industry",neg,train
In asset management in the press release you talk about the average fee rates for those $4,neg,train
"3 billion of redemptions were kind of around four basis points, which is pretty helpful",neg,train
"But what about the average fee rates that you’re collecting on the inflows that you're getting, and how is that compare to the outflows?",neg,train
And we completed the acquisition of Limestone investments which complements our strength in U,neg,train
"I would note that we’ll remain in that outflows, particularly low fee third-party institutional former parent assets, our revenues and the fee rate overall for the business are up year-over-year reflecting the mix of assets we manage",neg,train
But it will be correlated to what the revenue growth is,neg,train
"In 2017, we continued our growth investments and excellent expense management discipline and at the same time maintain our strong financial foundation",neg,train
"And consistent with our long-term strategy, we grew our lower capital fee-based businesses of wealth management and asset management to be 73% of our total operating earnings for the quarter, complemented by our protection and annuity businesses",neg,train
"Turning to slide three, you will see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter",neg,train
"As you are aware, the tax cuts and jobs act was established in the fourth quarter resulting in a $320 million unfavourable charge in the quarter",neg,train
"Given the charge is one time in nature, we are also provided our operating results adjusted for the tax re-measurement impact",neg,train
"Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide two you see a discussion of forward-looking statements",neg,train
Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials,neg,train
"Let’s turn to page nine, asset management financial performance remained very strong",neg,train
"Revenues were up 8% from strong market appreciation as well as performance fees and the unwinding of two CLO’s in the period, in addition, the fee rate increase reflecting our mix of business",neg,train
"From CLO, the total was 32; it’s around 16 [ph] or 60 [ph]",neg,train
"As you saw, while we took a one time charge in the quarter for the new tax act, we expect the ongoing benefits from tax reform to be positive",neg,train
You kind of hit on the second part of my question there; so if I look at the retention in the employee channel that improve nicely as well,neg,train
"So I guess should we think of that as a sign that you guys are sort of getting closer to the end of kind of phasing out lower producers and in other words that that net number in the employee headcount should start to kind of creep higher and grow from here versus you guys had really good recruiting but then some lower producers were leaving, so we are in a little bit more of a steady-state now?",neg,train
"Just wanted to start with free cash flow on our post-tax reform basis, can you help us think through sort of what the annual pace of free cash flow generation is after the effective tax reform?",neg,train
We've gone through an extensive process and obviously looking at the level of research and how to reengineer,neg,train
So I would say that we bought the cost a bit down and still maintain servicing capabilities that were associated with it,neg,train
"So it should not be a major event for us in 2018, obviously where there’ll be some of the course, but we have really reengineered those cost of levels that we can manage",neg,train
We experienced a more normal level of outflows at U,neg,test
The CLO business provided good revenue and earnings benefit in 2017 as a number of deals unwound,neg,train
Expenses continue to be prudently managed due to the timing of performance related compensation that I previously mentioned and foreign exchange translation,neg,train
G&A was up 8% year-over-years excluding those items G&A would be up only 1%,neg,train
"The PTI impact, I gave you is a six and then had to go through the compensation",neg,train
"That was performance fees then you have the CLOS, the total is 32",neg,train
"And then in advice and wealth management I know you don't give the exact data, but would you say your net new business in 2017 is that doing better than we saw say in 2015 and 2016?",neg,test
"Unfortunately, like the industry we are impacted by higher cat losses in the quarter on the wildfires in California",neg,train
"Overall, aside from those cat losses, we’re seeing improvement in the underline loss development trends and that’s starting to be reflected in our financial results and reserve position",neg,train
"In terms of the quarter, I’ll start with investment performance",neg,train
"With several large firms now pulling out of the broker protocol, can you talk about how you see that impacting recruiting for Ameriprise going forward?",neg,train
Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners,neg,train
Our Advice & Wealth Management business is powerful and growing,neg,train
The consumer opportunity around the need for advice is increasing,neg,train
Ameriprise is one of the largest providers in the industry and we are very well situated with our leadership position and an advice value proposition,neg,train
"(NYSE:AMP) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  9:00 AM ET",neg,train
"In terms of the quarter, RiverSource launched our first Fixed Index annuity, which is a long-term retirement savings vehicle that can add stability to client’s retirement portfolios",neg,train
"Overall, we are focused on maintaining strong books of business in 2018",neg,test
I’m pleased to share that we had an excellent fourth quarter concluding what was a very strong year for Ameriprise,neg,train
"Clearly, the strong markets and operating environment we experienced throughout most of 2017 remains favourable in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"In addition, we had the beneficial impact of improving economies globally and the pro-growth agenda in Washington which boosted financial markets and investor sentiment",neg,train
These are important differentiators and key to a strong reputation in the industry,neg,train
"In addition, we earned a number of important accolades in 2017",neg,train
"Number one in customer service, number one in forgiveness, number two in trust, a top performer in serving clients best interest and we also ranked first for the likelihood to recommend the firm to friends or colleague",neg,train
"I don’t want to have to figure out myself, if you don’t mind",neg,train
And recently Ameriprise ranked number one for customer loyalty in the investment industry in the 2017 Temkin Index,neg,train
"We’re going to continue to tell our story through our integrated TV, digital and social media platform and we picked up 2018 with new ads for Our Be Brilliant and we’ll continue to invest in our brand and marketing including in our digital experience to provide clients with increased capabilities and security",neg,train
"I think if you look at the overall average fee rates for asset management is probably around 52 to 53 basis points, which is say that the new business that you’re bringing in would be higher than that or in line with that?",neg,train
Capital return was slower in the second half of the year as we would expect giving the share price appreciation,neg,train
Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results adjusted for tax re-measurement,neg,train
"It’s again dealing with cat losses, you have to demonstrate it then non-anomalous and that because they are it’s very tough to pass rate",neg,train
We have courage; it was really the unique nature of the California fires two of them,neg,train
There is a lot of catastrophe loss activity in 4Q and generally in 2017 in the industry,neg,train
Can you talk about your pricing power as a result and then I have one follow up,neg,train
The prior year benefited from a $12 million reserve lease and lower cat losses,neg,train
"On an underlying basis, auto and home earnings were up from last year",neg,train
Fixed annuities pretax operating earnings declined $6 million as lapses in interest rates continue to impact results as expected,neg,test
"Turning to Protection on slide 11, Life & Health pretax operating earnings improved 16%",neg,test
"Overall claims experience is in line with expected ranges, though disability claims came in favorable to last year",neg,train
"Ameriprise results in the quarter and in the year demonstrated significant progress in obtaining our long-term shareholder objectives with strong growth in revenue, EPS, and return-on-equity",neg,train
I will go through the results in detail on the following pages,neg,train
"As we announced early in January, Ameriprise had a one-time primarily non-cash impact in the fourth quarter related to the Tax Cut and Job Act of $320 million",neg,train
"This charge was related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets, repatriation tax and lower future tax benefits from low income housing assets",neg,train
And just my last is just on the advice and wealth management business,neg,train
"In the past you’ve talk about the reasons why you exited the bank largely due to regulatory concerns and with some of the deregulation that's going on across financial services, are you contemplating or considering getting back into that business?",neg,train
"Let’s turn to AWM on slide eight, Advice & Wealth Management delivered an outstanding quarter and a year",neg,train
"Revenues were up 17% driven by strong rap net inflows, improve transactional activity levels and market appreciation",neg,train
"And then, staying with asset management, so you are going through the platform consolidation that was started in 2017 and my understanding is it’s probably complete in 2018",neg,train
And looking at your expenses you seems to be getting pretty good results from the consolidation in terms of expenses which is pretty much flat for the full year and at the most in large part,neg,train
And my understanding is some of the benefits would have yet to come through in 2018,neg,train
So how should we think about the potential efficiency gains that you can generate from the platform consolidation in 2018?,neg,train
"Moving to some of the key metrics for the quarter, Ameriprise retail client assets grew by 17% to $560 billion as we continue to serve more clients including more affluent clients and deepen our relationships with them",neg,train
"Just in terms of the asset management assets under management, could you just remind us how much of that AUM is more general account versus I guess I would call that more third party AUM? Thanks",neg,train
I know fourth quarter mutual fund net sales in VD and IAD channels improved by about $2 billion reflecting progress in our segmentation strategy and enhance business intelligence tools,neg,train
And then can you also update us on what you're seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics around cash fees and I guess what you're anticipating in terms of the benefit from additional rate hikes that we may get in 2018?,neg,train
We delivered a 39% margin in the quarter supported by the strong performance fees in CLO’s,neg,train
We continue to expect the margin to be in the 35% to 39% range in the near-term,neg,train
Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research,neg,train
What was that the dollar contribution from the CLO unwind in the fourth quarter?,neg,train
Before I go there I just want to say that 435 RBC that we reported actually is above the standard,neg,train
So we're starting at a good place from that standpoint,neg,train
"As relates to the – you’re saying is the loss 13, that was a PTI loss",neg,train
"The majority I would say about only 30%, 40% was claims and that related to basically experience of having new claims come in and cohorts that were higher than on daily payouts and we book it",neg,train
Our active reserve adequacy as we look at and we did extensive analysis and that trend line has now subsequently changed,neg,train
"The other parts of it, we had around $4 million to $5 million loss in LTC which is normal",neg,train
"And then the other part was really, we had to do with timing issue that we looking at transfers and some lapsing that we didn’t pick up the exact amount",neg,train
But again it is -- we feel extremely comfortable with reserves,neg,train
It's gone through extensive reviews and certainly we feel that they are adequate and we constantly monitor,neg,train
"And then as you think about tax reform just from a business perspective, do you expect to retain the benefits of the lower tax rate i",neg,train
"We personally look at the marketplace competitively, in asset management we make adjustments in fee levels appropriately based on whether it's institutional or retail in certain activities, but we’ve been doing that on an ongoing basis, not necessarily or will be driven by the tax rate",neg,train
"And in AWM as well, it's based on client level of activity and value and appropriate for the adviser to decide for the activities with their clients and nothing is going to be holistically driven by the tax rate",neg,train
And then there have been a lot of press reports about the California Insurance Commissioner possibly pressuring rate for property insurers in light of tax reform so that the corporate reduction is passed completely along the policy holders,neg,train
The flow picture that we bring in from the new flows actually have good rates to them including in the institutional side of the business,neg,train
So we still feel very good about the total that we’re managing and echoes both domestically but also internationally,neg,train
We’re bringing in some good retail asset net inflows in the international marketplace as well as good fees,neg,train
"Just looking at the wrap flows, it was a very strong annualized organic growth in the quarter",neg,train
"What would you highlight as particular drivers for the recent strength inflows, more specific I'm just wondering how much could be driven by potential shifts from my commission-based accounts? Thanks",neg,train
"Regarding our operating numbers, excluding the tax impact we highlighted, we reached new highs on many metrics",neg,train
Both earnings and earnings per share grew significantly from a year ago,neg,train
3 billion of excess capital reflecting the impact of tax reform,neg,train
"We delivered strong results across the firm, with excellent momentum and returns in Advice & Wealth Management",neg,train
Assets under management and administration reached a new high of $897 billion up 14% driven by continued strength in Ameriprise client flows and equity market appreciation,neg,train
"In 2017, Ameriprise received 100% rating on the corporate equality Index and we’ve earned this for the last 12 years",neg,test
Columbia Threadneedle was named employer of the year at the women and finance awards,neg,test
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
We brought in good client flows and our wrap net inflows grew 51% to $5 billion for the quarter,neg,train
"As a result, we continue to grow productivity nicely with operating total net revenue per financial advisor increasing 15% year-over-year, adjusting for net 12b-1 fee impacts",neg,train
"As a result of our consistent investments and the support we provide our advisors, we help them grow at a higher rate than the industry competitors over the longer term",neg,train
"With good growth and productivity as well as our expense discipline, we expand the pretax operating margins in AWM significantly to 22% in the fourth quarter, and if you look at the full-year, margins grew 300 basis points to 21",neg,train
"As part of this work, we are investing to strengthen our online presence",neg,train
"as a digital leader in asset management for a website and social media channels, and how they help advisors create solutions and achieve investor goals",neg,train
We’ve had a good response to our ongoing advertising campaign centered on consistency,neg,train
"That included launching new ads on CNBC, awareness is up in our key regions and we are pleased with the results so far",neg,train
And our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
First question on message to – do you have – it’s a better idea of what the impact to your G&A expenses would be for your European operations,neg,train
I know it’s very – from the other side of the table I know it's been a very complicated process,neg,train
So I was just wondering if you sort of narrow that down at all as to what the impact would be?,neg,train
"It’s a tad lower but it's -- if you take a look at the inflow versus the outflow for your question, the inflow basis points are about 15% higher than the outflow as we look over the quarter and looked over the 2017",neg,train
"We have seen – over the year there’s been some increase and certainly we follow that because we’re coming of a very low base, but it's been much less than we originally would've anticipate in the beginning of the year",neg,train
"Dollar amount performance fees, well, I gave you PTI, I don’t if I have them",neg,train
So take whatever our estimate is for earnings on a post-tax reform basis applied at 85% to 90% and then you’re saying add 150 million to 200 million on top of that?,neg,train
"First, I had one follow-up on taxes and just wondering if you expect the lower tax rate to have any impact on pricing or fee rates and neither the advice & wealth management or asset management businesses?",neg,train
"In asset management, we are generating good financial returns in managing and involving operating environment as we benefit from positive markets and our expense discipline",neg,train
Regarding the business we are focused on executing our near-term plans while positioning the firm to compete globally over the long-term,neg,train
"If you haven’t said, what is the dollar amount of the performance fees and asset management for the quarter?",neg,test
"And then just on the long-term care in the runoff corporate operation, the loss of around 13 million, that's the highest loss you’ve had",neg,train
And I know you guys called out clean severity and then it normalized in December,neg,train
"But how should we think about your comfort in reserves just given, I mean you had GE take a very large charge in the market for the same type of business",neg,train
But can you talk a little bit about your comfort in that exposure?,neg,train
"Asset Management revenue was up 8% from markets, performance fees in our hedge funds, and U",neg,train
Annuities in life and health insurance revenues were relatively flat consistent with prior trends,neg,train
In the auto and home business revenues declined 7% due to the additional reinsurance arrangements established in 2017,neg,train
"And on the Life side, fourth quarter sales continue to show improvement over previous quarters particularly in IUL sales",neg,train
"We continue to help advisors provide these important solutions to clients from using data analytics to improve insurance underwriting, to implementing new digital and e-capabilities",neg,train
The strength of the Ameriprise culture is essential to how well-positioned we are to continue to deliver long-term value to clients and all our stakeholders,neg,train
"Now Walter will cover the financials, and I’ll be back to take your questions",neg,test
"Recently, I met with our field leadership team to kick off the year and reminded them how a year ago our industry was facing a great deal of uncertainty with the Department of Labor role",neg,train
"Assets under management were up 9% to nearly $500 billion, and we are generating competitive financial results in the quarter",neg,train
"Operating earnings were up 27% and the adjusted margin increased to more than 39%, this includes a strong quarter for performance fees and CLO unwinds",neg,train
And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs,neg,train
Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
Last year you did two what I call bolt-on deals,neg,test
"How does the pipeline look for 2018 and if you do deals, were they’ll be sort of that similar size?",neg,train
"As I reflect on last year, we remain focused on what sets us apart providing a top quality experience to clients and advisors supported by strong solutions what we executed and invested in our strategy for long term value creation",neg,test
Advice & Wealth Management made up nearly 45% of the earnings in the quarter,neg,train
Combined with asset management the fee-based business is made up 70% of our earnings for the full year and 73% for the fourth quarter,neg,train
This mix shift supports our strong free cash flow generation,neg,train
"On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions",neg,test
We are making progress however with the move to passive there’s more work,neg,train
"and Europe retail, we had another good quarter for both gross and net sales, with net inflows of about 500 million",neg,test
It was the third consecutive quarter of net inflows in the U,neg,train
And then I guess separately just want to go back to the capital discussion for a second,neg,train
"I hear you on reinvesting some, but I guess if we think about the return of capital on a pro forma for tax reforms, kind of higher earnings base, is 90% to 100% payout, still what you guys are shooting for and the mix between kind of dividends and buybacks?",neg,train
We feel very good about the value proposition we have and our ability to track advisors,neg,train
Today we tracked them from firms that weren't in the protocol as well,neg,train
We are in the protocol and so we’re remaining in,neg,train
"Overall, we are positioning the business for the long-term to deliver for clients and generate good returns",neg,train
"In closing, Ameriprise had a strong quarter and an excellent year",neg,train
"We continue to be recognized for the way we work together, as well as for our community involvement",neg,train
"Walter, the decline in excess capital of 400 million, was that all RBC tax reform driven? And does that imply that you’re not changing your RBC target despite the fact that there’s kind of been mechanical change in RBC",neg,test
"Going forward, we will be consistent and prudently manage expenses relative to the level of revenue growth AWM had substantial earnings growth and margin expansion in the quarter and for the full year",neg,train
The margin in the quarter was up 270 basis points to 22% and up 300 basis points to 21,neg,train
"Moving to slide six, overall revenue growth was strong, up 10% in the quarter driven by Advice & Wealth Management Asset Management",neg,train
"Strong growth in client assets, particularly in wrap accounts and market appreciation drove substantial 17% topline growth in AWM",neg,train
"That is still the guidance from that standpoint to 90% to 100%, again circumstance driven, but that's where we said that we would target",neg,train
So you still expect to be able to retain at least some of the benefit of additional rate hikes?,neg,train
We’re building off an excellent year and started 2018 in a favorable position,neg,train
We know that the experience and the advice value proposition we provide to clients creates confidence in its industry leading and we want to help more consumers experience it,neg,train
"That’s a fair way and we’ll be refining as we go through, but it’s a good measure to go through",neg,train
Walter Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President,neg,train
"It also was another strong quarter for recruiting with 99 high quality advisors joining the firm, in fact it was one of our best quarters in terms of quality and quantity of advisor recruits, and we continue to see larger size practices joining Ameriprise",neg,train
Couple of questions for you guys around the De Young [ph] business,neg,train
"I guest first around recruitment, if I look at the quarter I guess you guys highlighted 99 new recruits for the year looks by a numbers over 360 or something like that",neg,train
Can you guys remind us kind of what the productivity of these new recruits stand today versus kind like their run rate once all the assets that are transition over to you guys? And then I have a follow-up,neg,train
Good morning and thank you for joining today's earnings call,neg,train
Walter will speak about the numbers and then we’ll be happy to take your questions,neg,train
I think overall as you think about the core of the AAG business that is correct,neg,train
"We do and have added the IPI channel which is a new channel that were still going through an integration of or will over the course of the year, so that's an aside",neg,train
But as a core of the AAG the answer is yes,neg,train
As you know that ones you look at and ones that you can actually do appropriately that make sense,neg,train
So it is something that we have as part of our plans,neg,train
We’ve delivered strong results in North America across domestic and international equities as well as taxable and tax exempt fixed income,neg,train
This performance is reflected in our strong line up of 114 four-and five-star Morningstar-rated funds globally,neg,train
We’ve also earned more than 50 investment awards around the world including terrific recognition as multi-asset manager of the year in the U,neg,train
"Interest rates continue to pressure earnings, however the portfolio is positioned well to benefit when interest rates rise",neg,train
"In the auto and home business, pretax operating results in the quarter were impacted by elevated cat losses of 38 million as well as the contractual reinstatement premium on our reinsurance program",neg,train
"G&A expenses were up 6% adjusting for the timing of accruals for performance-based compensation, including asset management performance fees and foreign exchange translation, G&A was essentially flat, expense discipline remains the focus as we move into 2018",neg,test
9 million from the prior quarter due to the sale of the Utah operation and de-leveraging of the balance sheet at year-end,neg,train
82% in the fourth quarter due to lower discount accretion on acquired loans in the current quarter,neg,train
Accretion accounted for six basis points of the loan yield in the fourth quarter compared to 12 basis points in the previous quarter,neg,train
"The contractual loan yield excluding accretion increased one basis point in the fourth quarter, to 4",neg,test
The net interest margin decreased four basis points to 4,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
And we're not changing our guidance relative to the run rate cost of the infrastructure build out being approximately $5 million a year,neg,train
"It’s really the temporary nature of some of the work an outside consultant expense that generated some of the increases that we saw this year that will begin to reduce in the first half, actually in the first quarter and the second quarter of 2018",neg,train
"So, a large percentage of the 17 million was related to the development of the risk management infrastructure in 2017",neg,train
"In terms of a percentage, I don't have a specific percentage to give you, but you can think of 30% to 40% of that number in 2017 was related to those projects and a good portion of that will begin to go away in 2018 once we reach the second and third quarters of 2018",neg,train
"As part of our capital management that does come into play, the timing this past quarter was somewhat linked with the de-leveraging as well, but we do have authorization and we look at that on a continual basis as one of the tools that we might use to manage capital",neg,train
"So I can’t promise you that it's going to continue, but the auction is always on the table",neg,train
"And then just on the expense run rate discussion with all the puts and takes, it seems like a little bit of relief in the first quarter and then maybe the run rate moves down a little more in the second, third and fourth",neg,train
Is that the right way of thinking about it or did I misinterpret that discussion?,neg,train
"With that, I'll turn the stage over to Lloyd for his comments",neg,train
"And then one thing that I want to make sure I got was the foregone service charges from the Utah operation, was that fully baked in to the fourth quarter dip in that number, in that revenue number, in that fee income number, the 13 million",neg,train
"We have added talented commercial and retail banking personnel to our company, and we have invested in further developing, integrating our bankers into Banner's proven credit and sales culture",neg,train
"While these investments have increased our core operating expenses, they have resulted in core revenue growth, strong customer acquisition, year-over-year growth in the loan portfolio, and strong deposit fee income",neg,train
"I'd like to tell you we’re that smart, but we were really just lucky in terms of how interest rates moved each time we decided to do the restructuring transaction in standard 10 billion",neg,test
I think the other aspect though it's important to note on that we benefited from as well was the change in the tax law,neg,train
3 million loss that we incurred in ’17 was subject to the 35% marginal tax rate,neg,train
"Going forward, the improved interest income will be subject to the 21% marginal tax rate",neg,test
"So again, we didn't know obviously like everything, but yes, we didn't know for sure that tax legislation would be signed when we made the decision to move back under 10 billion",neg,train
"But timing sometimes, it’s better to be lucky than good",neg,train
"Maybe a question for Lloyd, following up on the expense line, I guess given the branch sale and the expense run rate, is there anything, I guess if we roll forward into Q1 kind of that run rate that's delayed or that we should see a reduction at all in some of the costs that -- on that front?",neg,train
"Now, for a brief discussion of loan growth, discussing fourth quarter loan growth is complicated by the sale of the Utah franchise that included loans of $255 million",neg,train
"Without adjusting for the sale, the portfolio shrank by a $175 million",neg,train
"After adjusting for the sale, loan growth in the fourth quarter was $75 million or 4% on an annualized basis",neg,train
"After making the same adjustment for the full-year, loans grew by $395 million or 5",neg,train
"For all of 2017, growth was spread across the portfolio with the most significant increases recorded in the C&I loan portfolio, a $167 million, the multifamily portfolio, $97 million, and the residential construction portfolio, $40 million",neg,train
Modest decreases did occur in agricultural and land development portfolios,neg,train
"So on balance, we should see a little reduction, probably a more significant impact in subsequent quarters",neg,train
4 million during the quarter as a previously restructured loan was reclassified into this category,neg,train
"1 million, and for all of 2017 were $5 million or 0",neg,train
After a fourth quarter provision of $2 million and net loan losses of $2,neg,train
"1 million, the allowance for loan and lease losses for the company now totals $89 million, and is 1",neg,train
"15% for both the linked quarter and December 31, 2016",neg,train
"The remaining net accounting mark against acquired loans is $21 million, which provides an additional level of production against loan losses",neg,train
"Banner Corporation (NASDAQ:BANR) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 11:00 AM ET",neg,train
"That will have the effect of having, as Lloyd pointed out, some improvement on the reported net interest margin",neg,train
"So barring seasonality and normal growth you'd expect in target the strategic growth, that's a good baseline number to work, that’s a good core number to work off of",neg,train
"However, the aggregate amount of net interest income generated for the first quarter is going to be very similar to the fourth quarter, because even though the rate is high, we’re going to have a somewhat lower earning asset balance in the first quarter",neg,train
"Outside of the investment portfolio, we continue to look for mid to high single digit loan growth throughout 2018 and commensurate growth in our core deposit base",neg,train
"Results for quarter just ended were impacted by the write-down of deferred tax assets following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017",neg,train
"Results were also significantly impacted by the sale of our Utah operations, and a net loss on the sale of securities in connection with our balance sheet restructuring designed to postpone the adverse impact of the Durbin amendment on debit card interchange fees",neg,train
"Again, this quarter excluding the acquisition discounts, contractual loan yields and the net interest margin benefited from increased market interest rates while deposit pricing remained generally unchanged",neg,test
"Deposit fees and service charges were steady and in line with our seasonal expectation at $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a $13",neg,test
3 million in the preceding quarter and increased 7% compared to $12,neg,train
That's a good core run rate now that we’re below 10 billion again,neg,train
"In a few moments, Lloyd Baker and Peter Conner will discuss our operating performance in more detail",neg,train
"While we have been effectively executing on our strategies to protect our net interest margin, grow client relationships, deliver sustainable profitability and prudently invest our capital, we have also focused on maintaining the improved risk profile of Banner",neg,train
"Again this quarter, our credit quality metrics reflects our moderate credit risk profile",neg,train
"The offsetting effects are – we’ll see some reductions in professional services going into the first and more meaningfully in the second quarter, obviously offset with just normal costs of growing the business in terms of personnel expense",neg,train
"At year-end 2017, the credit landscape at Banner mirrors the steady story of the recent past, stable and well-positioned",neg,train
My remarks this morning will be brief and concentrate on the stable nature of the company's credit metrics and the loan portfolio's moderate risk profile,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Tim O’Brien of Sandler O’Neill,neg,train
I would also like to welcome you to the full-year and fourth quarter 2017 earnings call for Banner Corporation,neg,train
"As is customary, joining me on the call today is Rick Barton, our Chief Credit Officer; Lloyd Baker, our Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation; Peter Conner, our Chief Financial Officer of Banner Bank; and Albert Marshall, the Secretary of the Corporation",neg,train
"Due to the hard work of our employees throughout the company, we are successfully executing on our strategies and priorities to deliver sustainable profitability and revenue growth to Banner",neg,train
"For all of 2017, our reported net interest margin was 4",neg,train
"20% for the year-ended December 31, 2016 and excluding the acquired loan discount accretion our 2017 contractual net interest margins expanded a 4",neg,test
04% for the same 12 month period a year earlier,neg,train
Banner's fourth quarter net interest income before provision for loan losses was again solid increasing 1% compared to a year ago despite the Utah branch sale that closed the first week of October,neg,train
"Similarly, our net interest income for the full-year-ended December 2017 was 5% greater than the same period a year earlier, again despite the sale of the branches that significantly reduced fourth quarter earning assets",neg,train
"So just another way to approach that professional services expense line, ’16 costs were a little over 8 million, ’17 costs were 17",neg,train
"5 million, how much of the 5 million that you referred to from the compliance side is reflected in that number and what is the -- the 17 million, how much comes out of that approximately do you budget for the full year ’18?",neg,train
"As Mark and Lloyd noted, there were a number of events that made for unusually noisy quarter",neg,test
"In order to fully understand our core operating results, a careful explanation of the impact of the sale of the Utah operation, de-leveraging of the balance sheet, and impact of tax legislation is necessary",neg,train
"As discussed previously, we announced in our earnings release -- as we announced in our early release, we reported a loss of $0",neg,train
1 million in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter,neg,train
"Professional services expense increased $2 million due to a combination of outside consulting engagements focused on completing the build out of the bank's risk management-related infrastructure, as well as normal seasonal increases in outside audit expense associated with year-end",neg,train
3 million as a result of media promotion campaigns and increases in direct mail marketing that normally increase this time of year,neg,train
2 million due to gains on sale of OREO completed in the fourth quarter,neg,train
Our full-year 2017 core revenue reached a record $479 million and increased 4% compared to the full-year of 2016,neg,train
"We benefited from a larger and improved earning asset mix, a net interest margin that remained above 4% and very good deposit fee income",neg,train
"And Kate, we will now open the call and welcome your questions",neg,train
The next question is from Matthew Clark of Piper Jaffray,neg,train
Ending assets declined 670 million from the end of the third to 9,neg,train
8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter as a result of the sale of Utah operation and the sale of investment securities undertaken to remain below 10 billion at year-end,neg,train
"3 billion at quarter end, reflecting the sale of 470 million in securities",neg,train
"First of all, it's always going to be lumpy and challenging to predict in a quarter to quarter",neg,train
"On balance, for the year, the fourth quarter was lower due to the fact that we had very low free payment activity in the acquired loan portfolios in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"So I won't characterize -- guarantee that it's going to go up, but I would say that the fourth quarter was unusually low, but over time, that rate of discount accretion continues to decline as we run through our acquired loans and the acquired loan discount",neg,test
"So again, I’d characterize it as lumpy and continuing to decline on an annualized basis from what we saw in 2017 going into 2018",neg,train
"I’m pretty proud of how well our margin is held up over an extended period of time, but as you know, the interest rate increase in the fourth quarter was mid December",neg,test
"So that will have a positive impact on the margin going forward and while we didn't do this intentionally with respect to the margin, the sale of the securities occurred in first half of December and interest rates have continued to trend up a little bit there",neg,train
"Now, that will change the mix back to have a little bit more security",neg,train
"Despite strong pre-tax earnings for the fourth quarter, Banner reported an after-tax net loss of $13",neg,train
"6 million of additional tax expense related to the write-down of our net deferred tax assets, following the recently-enacted changes to Federal tax laws",neg,train
"This DTA write-down was also reflected in our full-year 2017 net income, which declined a $60",neg,train
"However, as Mark has noted, excluding this unusual tax expenses as well as the gain on the sale of the Utah branches, securities gains and losses, changes in the value -- financial instruments carried at fair value and last year's acquisition-related costs, our 2017 earnings from core operations increased to $98",neg,train
99 per diluted share compared to $94 million or $2,neg,train
78 per diluted share in 2016; a 7% in this core earnings per share,neg,train
17 per share decrease from the prior quarter was due to the following items,neg,train
03 due to an increase in average loan outstandings as a result of the sale of the Utah operations and a decline in the loan discount accretion on acquired loans,neg,test
We also may make other forward-looking statements in the question-and-answer period following management's discussion,neg,train
"These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed today",neg,test
"Information on the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ are available from the earnings press release that was released yesterday and a recently filed Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017",neg,train
"Forward-looking statements are effective only as of the date they are made, and Banner assumes no obligation to update information concerning its expectations",neg,train
It is also important to note that loan growth occurred throughout our remaining footprint,neg,train
"The markets in which we make residential construction loans are either undersupplied, or imbalance resulting in timely absorption and managing both levels of completed inventory",neg,train
"As I said at offset of my remarks, it was a stable year, a stable year for credit at Banner, which further solidified the moderate risk profile of our loan portfolios and positions us well for the future",neg,train
I'll now turn the call over to Rick Barton to discuss the trends in our loan portfolio,neg,train
"The company's level of classified assets remained low, decreasing 5% during the fourth quarter",neg,test
Non-performing assets also decreased two basis points during the quarter to 0,neg,train
"Non- performing assets were split between non-performing loans of $27 million and OREO of a mere $360,000",neg,train
"Not reflected in these totals are the remaining non-performing loans of $6 million acquired from Siuslaw and AmericanWest Banks, which are not reportable under purchase accounting rules",neg,train
"If we were to include the acquired non-performing loans in our non-performing asset totals, the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets would still be a modest 36 basis points",neg,train
Core deposits declined 222 million or 3% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the sale of Utah operations and transfer of certain client deposits to off balance sheet alternatives as part of our de-leveraging strategy,neg,train
"Excluding the impact of the sale of Utah operation, core deposits declined 80 million or 1%, principally due to transfer of client deposits to off balance sheet alternatives",neg,train
"As announced, Banner Corporation reported a net loss to common shareholders of $13",neg,train
"41 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017",neg,train
This compared to a net profit to common shareholders of $0,neg,test
76 per share for the third quarter of 2017 and $0,neg,test
"At the end of the quarter, our ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 1",neg,train
"In a moment, Rick Barton, our Chief Credit Officer will discuss the credit metrics of the company and provide some context around the loan portfolio and our success at maintaining a moderate credit risk profile",neg,train
"So in regards to your question on DFAST, so I think it’s important in that so well we stayed under 10 billion in total assets at year end",neg,train
It didn't change our timing on becoming a DFAST filer,neg,train
"In 2019, since that is triggered on a different basis of four quarter moving average, asset over 10 billion",neg,train
So we don't expect that meaningful increase in DFAST related costs,neg,train
We've already built in much of that infrastructure in 2017,neg,train
"As outlined in our earnings release, Banner Corporation's fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by the write-down of our deferred tax assets",neg,train
"And so when you take that into account, we do not anticipate being in another position at the end of ’18 to deliver once again below $10 billion",neg,train
"That was really a function of the sale of the Utah operation that gave us the opportunity to do it this year, but we don't foresee that type of event occurring again in 2018",neg,test
A reconciliation of these earnings from core operations and non-GAAP financial information which we believe is more indicative the trends in Banner's operation is included in our press release and I strongly encourage you to review it,neg,train
Our financial performance in the quarter again was driven by a strong net interest income and deposit fee generation reflecting additional client acquisition and a continued positive operating environment which supported loan growth and solid asset quality,neg,train
"2 million gain on the sale of Utah branches total revenues for the quarter were a $128 million, a 10% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
"So Peter, if I get you right then, the 5 million should be in the run rate and I guess, again, if you trigger the 10 billion mark of a different definition I guess, but there's no revamp in expenses as you approach kind of -- as we go forward, I suppose in that number?",neg,train
"The effects of purchase accounting, including both loan accretion and time deposit premium amortization accounted for five basis points of the net interest margin in the fourth quarter, compared to 10 basis points in the previous quarter",neg,train
The contractual margin excluding the effects of purchase accounting increased one basis point in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Core non-interest income excluding gains and losses on security sales, fair value adjustments on securities and debt instruments carried at fair value increased $450,000 from the prior quarter primarily as the result of a modest increase in multifamily gain on sale income",neg,train
"Excluding the impact of deposit fees generated by the Utah operation, core non-interest income increased $700,000 over the prior quarter",neg,train
Other fee income categories were generally in line with the prior quarter,neg,train
We're still comfortable with what we've said in the past,neg,train
"And unless there are some follow-on questions, I think that you stated it very well",neg,train
"And then just last one for me, on the adjusted reserve ratio, it was unchanged I think this quarter at 1",neg,train
"And I think you guys have talked about that feeling comfortable with that ratio, getting down to maybe 1",neg,train
"I guess, what are your updated thoughts on that coverage ratio and where they kind of settle out in this environment?",neg,train
"Overall, this resulted in a core earnings return on average assets of 0",neg,train
"Once again, our performance this quarter and for the full-year reflects continued execution on our super community bank strategy, that is, growing new client relationships, improving our core funding position by growing core deposits, and promoting client loyalty and advocacy through our responsive service model, while augmenting our growth with opportunistic acquisitions",neg,train
"To that point, despite our fourth quarter balance sheet restructuring to stay below $10 billion, our core deposits increased 2% compared to December 31, 2016, and our non-interest bearing deposits increased 4% from one year ago, and now represent 40% of total deposits",neg,train
Our presentation today discusses Banner's business outlook and will include forward-looking statements,neg,train
"Those statements include descriptions of management's plans, objectives, or goals for future operations, products or services, forecast of financial or other performance measures, and statements about Banner's general outlook for economic and other conditions",neg,train
Total loans decreased 207 million from the prior quarter end as a result of the sale of Utah operations along with a decline in held for sale multi-family loans as a result of a bulk sale completed at the end of December,neg,train
"Excluding the impact of the sale of the Utah loan portfolio, loans held for portfolio increased by 75 million or 4% in the link quarter and 395 million or 5",neg,train
"09, as a result of increased professional services and marketing expense",neg,train
Partially offset by an increase in gains on sales of OREO,neg,train
35 in the current quarter due to the write down of company's deferred tax assets as a result of the passage of the tax legislation,neg,train
8 million in the fourth quarter of '16 as we continued to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support the expanded scale of the company and incurred increased compliance and regulatory cost associated with a $10 billion total asset threshold,neg,train
It seems like that redeployment in the securities happened last year as well in early ’17?,neg,train
"I was just going to say, we're trying to figure out how Rick's going to get another $2 million worth of again on REO sales with $360,000 balance in REO",neg,train
"And then on the discount accretion, it came down quite a bit",neg,train
"I mean, should we be kind of forecasting that to come down off 1 million or was that – there was something unusual there that depressed it this quarter",neg,train
"On an annual basis, core deposits grew 140 million or 2% from the prior year quarter end",neg,train
"Excluding the sale of Utah operations, core deposits grew 274 million of 4% from the prior year quarter-end",neg,test
"Time deposits declined $134 million in the fourth quarter due to continue runoff of the retail time deposit portfolio, maturity of brokered CDs, and the sale of the Utah operation",neg,train
Total cost of deposits was 15 basis points flat to the prior quarter,neg,train
We still have a remaining roughly 1 million shares that we can repurchase under the current authorization,neg,train

I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Grescovich for closing remarks,neg,train
"So maybe a different tact, so was -- can you identify or distinguish a percentage of that 17",neg,train
Maybe that’s a different way you can -- we can get at this,neg,train
Is there a chunk of that that just flat out comes out that's not going to recur that’s identifiable?,neg,train
Good morning and welcome to the Banner Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call and Webcast,neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions",neg,train
"Further, as I have noted before, we have received marketplace recognition of our progress in our value proposition as J",neg,train
Power and Associates ranked Banner the number one bank in the Northwest for client satisfaction,neg,train
"The Small Business Administration named Banner Bank Community Lender of the Year for the Seattle and Spokane District for two consecutive years, and this year named Banner Bank Regional Lender of the Year for the second consecutive year, and Bankrate",neg,test
com named Banner Bank the Best Regional Bank in America,neg,train
"Also, Banner ranked 35 out of 100 in the Forbes 2018's Best Banks in America",neg,train

Delinquent loans increased 21 basis points from the linked quarter to 0,neg,train
A change in the delinquent loans of this magnitude should not be unexpected when total delinquent loans are at their current low level,neg,train
"This investment is even more visible looking at 2017 full-year operating expenses which increased 5% to $227 million compared to 2016's adjusted expenses of $311 million, excluding the acquisition related cost",neg,train
"Looking forward, curtailing this operating expense growth to a level better aligned with revenue growth is an important priority for Banner entering 2018",neg,train
"Finally, I believe it's worth noting that our capital remains very strong although our tangible equity was reduced during the quarter by the impact of the DTA write down and by the repurchase of $30 million of common stock",neg,train
"Aside from the one-time items, our core operating performance remains solid and continue to reflect the success of our proven client acquisition strategies, which are producing strong core revenue and a record pre-tax earnings for the year, and we are benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions, which have had a dramatic impact on the scale and reach of the company, and are providing a great opportunity for revenue growth",neg,test
"More importantly, despite the sale of the Utah branches and the related loans and deposits, our revenues from core operations for the current quarter, which excludes debt gains as well as gains in lots on the sales securities and changes in the value of financial instruments carried at fair value were a $119",neg,train
3 million a 2% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"3 million for the year-ended December 31, 2017 a 4% increase compared to the same 12 month period a year earlier",neg,train
This growth in core revenue generation continues to reflect the successful of our super community bank business model and the increasing value of the Banner franchise,neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Grescovich, President and CEO",neg,train
I would like to thank all my colleagues who are driving the solid performance for our company,neg,train
Thank you for your interest in Banner and for joining our call today,neg,train
We look forward to reporting our results to you again in the future,neg,train
"18% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4",neg,train
22% for the quarter ended -- the previous preceding quarter as a result of decreased acquired loan discount accretion,neg,train
Our contractual margin remained strong excluding the impact of acquisition accounting our contractual net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 4,neg,train
"And then one last one on just the margin, maybe for Lloyd, just any margin -- delayed margin benefit from the balance sheet restructuring that's anticipated?",neg,test
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeff Rulis of D,neg,train
"But we're not in a position to give you specific numbers or guidance about exactly what that is, but there is a significant amount of that 17 million in 2017 that will come out in 2018",neg,train
"The Utah generated about 250,000 in fee income per quarter",neg,train
"Nearly all of that was out of the fourth quarter, we closed on October 6",neg,train
"So we did have a few days of Utah in the fourth quarter, but by and large, that $250,000 contribution from Utah was absent in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"For the full-year-ended December 31, 2017, Banner Corporation reported net income available to common shareholders of $60",neg,test
"Excluding the impact of items just described in the fourth quarter, merger and acquisition expenses, gains and losses on the sale of securities and changes in fair value of financial instruments, earnings from core operations increased 5% to $98",neg,train
"Further, we continued our strong organic generation of new client relationships",neg,train
"Our organic net client growth in these product categories is now 92% since December 31, 2009",neg,train
"Reflective of the solid performance, coupled with our strong tangible common equity ratio of 10",neg,test
"61%, we issued a core dividend in the quarter of $0",neg,train
"25 per share and repurchased 520,000 shares of common stock",neg,train
"For the full-year 2017, deposit fees and service charges increased by 5% to $51",neg,train
8 million a direct result of growth in core deposit accounts and related transaction activity,neg,train
Fourth quarter mortgage banking revenues increased modestly compared to the immediately preceding quarter and were nearly unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"However, for the full-year 2017 mortgage banking revenues declined by 18% as the increasing interest rates and other market conditions were clearly less favorable than in the previous year",neg,train
"I will leave much of the detail related to those actions for Peter to discuss; however, I do want to reiterate what we have stated in the earnings release that our core operations remain solid during the quarter and for all of 2017, with strong net interest income and other revenues contributing to record pre-tax earnings for the year",neg,train
"Banner's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 operating results continued to reflect the increased scale of the company, and consistent revenue trends as a result of effective execution on our strategic initiatives, as well as meaningfully increased regulatory and risk management infrastructure costs as we plan for growth beyond the $10 million total asset benchmark",neg,train
"And on a related front, I guess, how do you guys -- how would you approach sort of DFAST costs or compliance costs, given I think you were kind of to the end of that and then depending on whatever regulatory world shapes up, is there -- at this point, it's kind of just a core expense rate and anything additional, how should we look at maybe additional or lower compliance costs, if you think about it that way",neg,train
"In summary, despite a number of unusual items during the fourth quarter, Banner Corporation had very solid performance in the quarter and for all of 2017 that continues to reflect the hard work of our many dedicated and skilled associates",neg,train
"But, first Peter will add some more color on the quarter",neg,train
7 million in marketing expense for the full year of ’17 and that's a reasonably good number to look at as far as expectations go in 2018,neg,train
"With the seasonality that you pointed out, reflect the quarter to quarter",neg,train
There obviously will be a little better impact from the branch sale,neg,train
"But perhaps more importantly, Jeff, is, as Peter pointed out, we did have very high professional service fees in the quarter",neg,train
"And we would expect some diminishment there, although the larger impact there will be probably in the second, third, and fourth quarter next of year",neg,train
"The one cautionary note of course is that, as Peter noted, we did have a significant gain on OREO sales in the quarter, which flows through as a credit to the expense line",neg,train
"And then finally, marketing was probably higher than our normal run rate during the quarter",neg,train
"So I think it's a testimony of exactly all the things that we've been saying on the call and have for several years now that small cells are going to be needed by all carriers across all markets, and there's going to be a lot of them",neg,train
"In order to provide not just carriers but more broadly, as people look to try to figure out how we can get consumers to use devices that have lower latency and greater speeds, the infrastructure is required to accomplish that",neg,test
So we feel like we sit in a sweet spot there from fiber and towers because both are going to be necessary in order to provide those kind of services to the consumer,neg,train
"As we look at the activity around towers, small cells and fiber solutions, the activity that we would expect in full year 2018 is greater than what we experienced during full year 2017",neg,train
"I mean, we're just now a couple of weeks into January, and our experience so far has been consistent with that expectation as we came into this year",neg,train
So we've seen increase in activity across all 3 areas,neg,train
"First, on FirstNet, I think one of your peers has actually talked about starting to see applications for FirstNet activity",neg,train
You mentioned in last night's release your guide is unchanged,neg,train
If you could just maybe give us some high-level comments or update on how you think FirstNet could impact your business in '18,neg,train
"And then secondly, on tax reform, just wondering if you've seen any change in plans or tone from customers, whether it's wireless customers or enterprise customers, on the fiber side in light of corporate tax reform late last year",neg,train
And we've talked about this over a long period of time,neg,train
"Whether it's committed or not committed, the value of doing some of these is that it gives some certainty and some line of sight to the carriers and reduces some paperwork, which, in turn, creates a little bit more speed for them",neg,train
"And so we found this to be valuable at points in time given the right set of circumstances and, in this case, the same thing",neg,train
But I'll go back to the point I'd said earlier,neg,train
"We carried forward the base escalators and haven't seen anything changing in the broader pricing environment around the way we're pricing new leases, amendments or escalations in the contracts",neg,test
"So far, from an operating results expectation and as well as the outlook, everything is in line with what our expectations were as we went through the diligence period",neg,test
"As you know, we get the best -- these questions a lot about the team",neg,train
"And if you remember, when we announced the transaction, we didn't assume or model any synergies associated with any of these transitions",neg,train
And I would put into this category not just the Lightower team but each of the fiber acquisitions that we've done over the last several years,neg,train
"And our experience has been, with each of the acquisitions, including, most recently, Lightower, these acquisitions bring with them a tremendous amount of talent and experience and insight into the business",neg,train
"On the first question, we obviously noted in the press release and mentioned in our remarks that we did not include impact of FirstNet into our outlook for 2018",neg,train
I'll pass on commenting on what I think the potential impacts could be,neg,train
"And if we have visibility and update to that, we'll certainly let you know when we know",neg,train
"On the second question, I don't know how to tie it directly to tax reform",neg,train
"I don't know whether it's tied directly to the tax reform or, more broadly, kind of the secular trends that we've talked about with increasing usage by the consumer, which is driving the need for network investment",neg,test
"During this earnings season, we've heard from one of your large customers who's doing a lot of fiber, and they've indicated they're increasingly less interested in using leased fiber solutions because they're looking to deploy fiber that has multiple use cases for themselves",neg,train
And so they feel like doing it themselves is a better option,neg,train
"Could you maybe talk a bit about how your customers are using your fiber, why you feel confident that you have assets in the right places? And are you actually finding that some of your tenants are, indeed, using your fiber for more than one reason? Or is this still very much targeted towards small cell solutions?",neg,train
"To your second question, the investment, you can look at our operating results, as we've mentioned a couple of times on the call, around new leasing activity",neg,train
New leasing activity around towers in calendar year 2018 is about $110 million is what our expectation is for the year,neg,test
Small cells is about $55 million of new leasing activity in 2018,neg,train
"We talked about, from a pricing environment, the pricing environment continues",neg,train
"So I think you will continue to see strong activity across both segments, the growth rates, as we've talked about, being higher on small cells than they are on towers",neg,train
And we'll first hear from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"I think when you provided initial Lightower guidance, you said here's what you thought calendar '18 would be anyway, right?",neg,train
Those are products that they're interested in and are using in various ways,neg,test
"To the question of the addressable market, which I think really goes into the heart of your question, we certainly don't anticipate or expect that as the usage continues to grow and site densification continues and use of small cells becomes increasingly important to some of the comments that I made in my prepared remarks, the carriers are going to self perform some portion of the need for small cells",neg,train
"To wrap up, 2017 was a very successful year for Crown Castle, and we remain excited about the opportunity to generate significant growth in cash flows across our asset portfolio and deliver on our 7% to 8% annual growth target in dividends per share",neg,train
"Further, we closed the acquisition of Lightower, the largest in our history, 2 months sooner than expected, and our early view of the operating performance of the business is in line with our expectations",neg,train
We increased our outlook for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $36 million due to the straight-line revenues associated with the customer agreements that Jay referenced earlier,neg,train
"First, it looks like new leasing activity in the quarter was a bit shy of the expectation you laid out in the third quarter, with full year new leasing activity coming at $166 million versus $172 million midpoint you indicated last quarter",neg,train
"Can you give some detail around what might have happened, if it was in any way related to the extensions you signed or if there's anything else we should bear in mind?",neg,train
And so the conversations have continued with many of the parties that we talked about last year and broadened,neg,train
"And what we've said, it'd be in the same neighborhood of what we've done historically in terms of land purchases and sustaining capital, so around $100 million each for those",neg,train
It will be up a little bit on sustaining because we've incorporated Lightower in 2018 versus 2017,neg,train
"Looking out over the next decade, we expect our customers will increasingly rely on a hyper dense network of towers and small cells connected by high-capacity fiber to provide these new services, which require faster speeds and significantly lower latency",neg,train
"With our distributed real estate of more than 40,000 towers, 50,000 small cells on air under contract and approximately 60,000 route miles of high-capacity fiber, we believe Crown Castle is in a unique position to benefit from these trends longer term",neg,train
"First, can you maybe provide a little bit more color on how much in total CapEx you're budgeting for this year? And maybe if you could break it into buckets",neg,train
"As you integrate the assets, are you finding any maybe synergy opportunities on the cost side, maybe procurement, best practices? And how long do you think that it would take to fully integrate the assets that you might be willing to look at more M&A opportunities?",neg,train
Have you had many discussions around using your infrastructure for fixed wireless broadband with any of your customers?,neg,train
Can you just compare how this leasing activity for either LTE advanced 5G compares to the original LTE buildouts a few years ago? Maybe what stage are we in? Do you think it will progress in kind of a similar way that we ramped up for a couple of years?,neg,train
So we're working hard at the moment to welcome about 900 new employees to Crown Castle and talk to them about why Crown Castle is a great place to be and why there's a lot of opportunity for them personally to work on the opportunity ahead for us as a company,neg,test
"On your first question, we're not going to get into the specifics of what we did around these agreements for obvious reasons",neg,train
So we're going to maintain sort of our historical practice of not commenting directly,neg,train
"But I think directly in answer to a part of your question, though, that as we extended the terms, the escalations remained the same",neg,train
"So broadly, in the pricing environment that we have seen, and we've talked about this, I think, over the last several quarters, the pricing environment, whether it's for new leases, amendments to leases or the underlying base escalator on those contracts, we've not seen any change in the pricing environment",neg,train
And I think that's reflected in the leasing activity and the growth in revenues that we've been showing on an organic basis,neg,train
"Now on the first question, the activity that we've seen, whether you go back and look at Sunesys or Wilcon, FiberNet, others, had been in line with what we talked about with regards to our expectations around Lightower",neg,train
And I've talked about it a couple of times on the call this morning,neg,train
And the financial returns on incremental investment of capital around that business has played out in line with what our expectations have been and in line with what we're talking about with regards to Lightower specifically,neg,test
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Crown Castle International Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
"At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ben Lowe",neg,train
"Typically, when you sign a holistic agreement, assume in that additional cell sites? Or is it typically just focused on amendments of current cell sites?",neg,train
"In addition, today's call includes discussions of certain non-GAAP financial measures",neg,train
Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle,neg,train
"I think probably, fundamental to the conversation is our belief that when you look at the macro tower sites, as we have seen for several decades, those macro tower sites don't move",neg,train
"So we obviously value long-term extensions, which are reflected in the results as we push the escalator out over longer periods of time and has the uplift to site rental revenues associated with that straight-line impact",neg,train
"But we certainly don't believe, over the long term, that the carriers are going to move macro tower sites",neg,train
"So we would assume, in due course, leases on macro tower sites get extended, and that would not be a big driver in terms of our thinking of value that's traded there",neg,train
That value is kind of near to the asset over a long period of time regardless of when ultimately you roll into the next term renewal,neg,train
"Around leasing activity, we just value what is going to go on the site and what's the price of that space that's being used and type of equipment that's going to be put on the tower and then run that out in order to figure out how to price any given contract",neg,train
"In 2017, we strengthened our leadership position with the acquisitions of FiberNet, Wilcon and Lightower that operate in top U",neg,train
markets where we see the greatest demand for network investment by our customers,neg,train
These investments reflect our strong belief that owning fiber is fundamental to delivering small cell solutions to our customers in a period of significantly increasing cell site densification,neg,train
I wonder if you could sort of characterize the level of activity around the applications,neg,train
"Obviously, you haven't got the leases signed to put, say, FirstNet into your guidance yet, but how are the application volumes generally compared to, say, this time last year? And then if there's any KPIs or anything you could share with us on the small cell and fiber business to get a better look under the hood there, appreciate that",neg,train
"I appreciate the sensitivity on the long-term contracts not to get into -- was it escalators or pricing, but clearly, the carrier wants to get something out of it",neg,train
"So should we expect that one of your asks would have been long-term contracts help us mitigate any longer-term churn? And was that done thinking about potential for M&A down the road or potential overbuilding? Just trying to think of -- obviously, two parties came at the table",neg,train
"Kind of help us understand what, on your side, you wanted to make sure you achieved out of that",neg,train
"I think one of the benefits of our company as we've set ourselves up to where -- if that mix changes from year to year, it doesn't really impact our business positively or negatively because we're getting a good portion of them",neg,train
And that's what I think has been kind of a unique position that we put Crown Castle in,neg,train
"And what's in your minds, if you look at the growth of your small cell and fiber business, what's the biggest constraint for that to grow faster? Is it just getting the booking? Is it just the time and labor to get small cells built? Is it capital? If you had to kind of rank order where you see things that may hold back growth in that business relative to sort of the broader commentary on small cells and fiber",neg,train
So I feel like we're well positioned for what's coming,neg,train
We expect between $910 million and $955 million of growth in site rental revenues from 2017 to 2018,neg,train
"As you can see on the slide, when compared to the prior outlook, there are no changes to either the organic contribution to site rental revenues or the contribution to growth from acquisitions in 2018",neg,test
"Looking at the far right side, the expected growth in site rental revenues is approximately $30 million higher when compared to the prior outlook, which is related to the higher straight-line revenues I just discussed",neg,test
"Next, we'll hear from David Barden of Bank of America",neg,train
"They're going to look to using more spectrum, densifying the network and using as much technology as they can",neg,train
"And no matter how that plays out, we're in position to take advantage of it",neg,train
So we're just looking out and seeing that all the trends are moving in the right direction,neg,train
"And whether DISH, like you're talking about specifically, or anybody else is going to use more spectrum or cell densification or newer technologies is going to play to our benefit",neg,train
"I noticed you guys took out the disclosure in the supplemental regarding the churn related to the Clearwire, Leap and PCS",neg,train
Can we still look back at last quarter's disclosures? And kind of is that still the same? Or is that -- any major changes in that?,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"We generated significant growth across our business by leveraging our leading portfolio of assets and focusing on our customers' evolving network needs, with this growth translating to an 8% increase in dividends per share compared to 2016",neg,train
"This growth was at the high end of our long-term annual dividends per share growth target and contributed significantly to the total return of 31% we generated for our shareholders, which compares favorably to the 22% returned by the S&P 500 in 2017",neg,train
"On your second question around synergies, we don't see any synergies at this point, to I think a question earlier on the call, around people",neg,train
Now what we've seen in terms of leasing the fiber for small cells continues to be at a pace of about twice what our historical experience has been for towers,neg,train
"So as we were previously adding and have for a long period of time in the neighborhood of about 1 tenant per tower over a 10-year period of time on the tower side, we're going at about twice that pace as we've seen lease-up on small cells",neg,train
"So directionally, we're continuing to see the sharing of the asset and the resulting economics pace -- at a pace faster than what we've historically seen on the towers side",neg,train
We've got significant plants in 23 of the top 25 markets in the U,neg,train
", and we are very well positioned to provide that fiber at a -- on a very timely basis at a very attractive cost profile to the customers",neg,train
"And I believe you will see, over a long period of time, that low cost and speed will win, as it has on the tower side and on the small cell side for a period of time",neg,train
"With regards to the technologies that are put at either end of the fiber, we're building high-capacity fiber",neg,train
So there are numerous strands and lots of capacity on the fiber that we're putting in the ground,neg,test
"And then, I guess, the tower services business seems to have picked up a little bit",neg,test
I guess the first one is just on the long-term contract extensions and the new business that got done in the fourth quarter,neg,test
"I guess some industry chatter out there suggests that maybe the terms and conditions are changing around that, specifically around escalators",neg,train
I was wondering if you could kind of just address kind of what the contracts' kind of terms and conditions look like relative to history,neg,train
"And then second, I guess, Dan or Jay, last quarter, when you were talking about the guide-up of, I think, about $190 million to $220 million, you broke it down into towers, fiber and small cells",neg,train
"I think towers was $110 million, and fiber and small cells were roughly half each of the balance",neg,train
Could you kind of revisit that? Is that still the same? And then could you kind of talk about the churn and how each of those 3 buckets are contributing to the churn numbers that we're looking at here in the guide for 2018?,neg,train
"As we turn the page on a great 2017, we believe the Crown Castle story remains compelling",neg,train
"We have positioned the company to benefit from a digital world, where massive amounts of data traverse networks",neg,train
"Based on this position, we are able to offer investors a unique value proposition of near-term returns consisting of a 4% dividend yield with 7% to 8% targeted annual growth while investing in assets and capabilities that we believe position us to generate growth for decades to come",neg,train
Our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets has significant capacity to support future organic growth as our customers look to access our assets to meet the increasing demand for data,neg,train
"And second, now that you've owned Lightower for almost three months, I mean, still a short period of time, but you've kind of been able to look under the hood",neg,train
"Can you talk about anything you might have encountered or observed that you didn't expect, whether positive surprises or maybe some challenges? And can you also touch on management retention?",neg,train
"Well, it feels like the growth is running pretty fast at the moment, so it doesn't feel constrained",neg,train
And I think that's reflected in kind of the numbers that we're talking about in terms of the growth that we're seeing with small cells and fiber,neg,test
"I would tell you, really big picture, if you go up 40,000 feet, we have a combination of 2 things that are happening around our fiber plant currently",neg,train
And then there's activity that's driving revenue related to building new fiber plant,neg,train
"To the extent that we get orders from customers to go into markets that we don't have existing fiber or there's not existing fiber in that market for us to utilize, then we go down the path of constructing new networks there",neg,train
"And as we talked about that build cycle for us, it's about a two-year build cycle from start to finish",neg,train
"As you saw from our earnings release yesterday afternoon, we finished 2017 on a strong note, delivering another quarter of solid financial results that capped off a terrific year for Crown Castle and its shareholders",neg,test
"And then on the last call, we discussed a little bit vapor IO",neg,train
Is there any update that you can provide on that project?,neg,train
Our solid fourth quarter results punctuated another very successful year for Crown Castle on several fronts,neg,train
"We increased our dividend per share by 8%, reflecting the underlying growth in our business and our commitment to return capital to shareholders",neg,train
"You mentioned the breakdown of the new leasing activity between tower, fiber, small cells",neg,train
Can you help us understand the escalator -- and you did that with churn as well,neg,train
Can you help us understand maybe the different dynamics of escalators on those 3 segments?,neg,train
"Following our successful bond offering earlier this month, the weighted average term remaining on our debt is approximately 6",neg,train
"5 years, with an average interest cost of under 4%",neg,train
"Additionally, we have approximately $3 billion of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility",neg,train
We invested approximately $9 billion in acquisitions and approximately $1,neg,train
"2 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $85 million of sustaining capital expenditures",neg,train
"And therefore, is that already reflected in, I guess, the step-up we saw in [indiscernible]? Or is it included, at least, in your new leasing activity guidance? And then secondly, when I look at the Lightower revenues in the fourth quarter, if you just kind of try to assume a full quarter benefit, call it, about $210 million of revenue or $840 million on an annualized basis versus your guidance of $850 million to $870 million for 2018, it seems like if you're going to be growing at high-single digits, which is what you've stated that business should be doing, that your $850 million to $870 million guidance is actually pretty conservative",neg,train
And I'm just trying to make sure I'm looking at the numbers correctly,neg,train
"Nick, what happened there is we typically have some -- at the end of the year, some -- in every quarter some nonrecurring or cleanup-type items that come in",neg,test
"That includes things like back billing for periods in the past and things of that nature, and we just didn't see that in the fourth quarter this year",neg,train
"But as you can see, when you look at 2018, we have everything that is remaining the same both in terms of the new leasing activity and the overall growth in revenues for organic site contribution, site rental revenues and otherwise",neg,train
And so it didn't impact the jumping off point in order to impact the 2018 guidance,neg,train
The barriers to entry in this business are extremely high,neg,train
"And once the investment has been embedded into an individual site, it is -- it becomes a part of a designed network",neg,test
And we see that very stable and have seen it over multiple renewals across multiple carriers for a long period of time,neg,train
"Crown Castle International Corp (NYSE:CCI) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 10:30 AM ET",neg,train
Could you talk a bit about what the specific tower organic site leasing growth rate was for the fourth quarter and maybe put that into perspective with where you see the industry right now?,neg,train
The reason we did that is that was -- to try to get some insight into a multiyear period of increased churn in the acquired networks,neg,train
"And where we are now, where the tower churn is back in the 1% or 2% range, we don't think it adds a lot of benefit to stay where -- what it is",neg,train
"We think that 1% to 2% range is good for a longer-term basis, so no real reason to continue to break out specific acquired network, but there's no change either from what we've disclosed last time",neg,train
"And anything you can do -- give us in terms of, say, the lease-up on the fiber and the small cell side per node, et cetera? I know you've given some of that color in the past",neg,train

"Similar to the wireless industry, the expected 20% annual growth in wired data traffic is driving additional demand across our dense metro fiber assets",neg,train
"I think last spring or summer, there was a notable pickup in discussions around various technology or Silicon Valley types that we're looking at, how they could leverage your assets",neg,train
Any update there on any potential developments that have taken place or any color that you can provide?,neg,train
"Importantly, we have underwritten our fiber investments based on existing applications, and the development of future technologies has the potential to further extend the runway of growth",neg,train
I believe you're going to see them search for and find a number of different partnerships,neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, we saw construction CapEx jump up meaningfully to $336 million",neg,train
What was driving that? And does it reset to a lower rate going forward? Or will it stay at an elevated -- relatively elevated level?,neg,train
"And that's very different than anything we've ever seen in any of the technology moves from 1G to 2G, 3G, 4G",neg,train
"Well, with that, I'll wrap up the call this morning",neg,train
"Obviously, I want to thank all of our employees who worked incredibly hard over 2017 not only to deliver on the results that we delivered but also the significant activities that are going on related to the integration of the assets that we've acquired",neg,train
Appreciate everyone's help on that and excited about what's in store for Crown Castle,neg,train
"And I think importantly, on the fiber side, we do see that, that is a differentiator there in that -- one of your questions around whether the existing fiber could withstand all of the demand that's coming, I think it's pretty clear from our actions",neg,test
because we don't see that what's there now is going to be able to carry all of the data that's going to be required to move -- to get these applications to people wherever they are,neg,test
It seems like there's certainly different characteristics between the customer bases and the churn,neg,train
I'm just trying to get a sense of how the mix could shift over time,neg,test
"Next, we'll hear from Spencer Kurn of New Street Research",neg,train
"And then at that point, you'll start to see the benefit of the returns as the assets age and we're able to incrementally add revenues to that existing plan",neg,train
"When considering the impact of these items, fourth quarter and full year 2017 results were within the ranges provided in our prior outlook for site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO",neg,test
"For the full year 2017, site rental revenues increased approximately 13% or $436 million as compared to full year 2016, including approximately 5% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenues",neg,train
"The fourth quarter was around 5% on the tower side, and I think it's in line generally with what the industry is doing",neg,train
"I think we're seeing our fair share of the activity given our portfolio of 40,000 assets across the U",neg,train
We think our assets are extremely well positioned to benefit from that,neg,train
"And I think that is also reflected on these agreements that we were just talking about a second ago, is that all of those characteristics of our business come out with our customers continuing to renew with us at the terms that we've seen and at the activity levels that are increasing as we're seeing this growth in demand",neg,train
"So to get at the second part of your question there, David, the breakdown of our new leasing activity between towers, small cells and fiber solutions haven't changed any",neg,train
"It's still $110 million at towers, $55 million at small cells and $45 million at fiber solutions",neg,train
"In regard to churn, we're about 1% to 2% on the towers side, and we think that that's a pretty good long-term view of what the churn is and pretty good for what would be in 2018",neg,test
"And then on the fiber solutions business, it's in the upper single digits on a per-year basis as a percentage of revenues",neg,train
And that really hasn't changed much either on our expectation for our outlook or longer term,neg,train
Thank you for joining us today as we review our fourth quarter 2017 results,neg,train
"With me on the call this morning are Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"To aid the discussion, we have posted supplemental materials in the Investors section of our website at crowncastle",neg,train
"com, which we will refer to throughout the call this morning",neg,train
"On the towers side, the escalator is still in the 3% range generally is what we're looking at",neg,train
"On small cells, it's generally about half of that on a per-year basis",neg,train
"And on the fiber solutions business, there really isn't any escalator at all",neg,train
You can see the 2018 outlook for AFFO growth remains unchanged at $360 million to $400 million,neg,train
"As a result, the 2018 outlook for AFFO per share at the midpoint is also unchanged at $5",neg,test
"50, representing approximately 10% growth when compared to 2017 AFFO per share after adjusting for the impact of Lightower and related financing transactions",neg,train
I guess Verizon's kind of arguing they're using a new generation of passive optical technology with multiple wavelengths and a lot more speeds,neg,train
And they don't want to just serve the wireless market,neg,train
"They also want to have kind of unique infrastructure, that they feel, historically, if they have unique infrastructure, they can create -- sell new services and gain market share",neg,train
"And I guess there's also some questions the cable -- separately, the cable companies are basically saying they have unique power at the edges of the network that are difficult for other people to kind of replicate what they have",neg,train
"I guess just curious, can your network support that type of service offering that Verizon's talking about as it's currently structured either the fiber or the conduits? And how do you argue against the uniqueness that they're kind of looking for?",neg,train

Our experience to date had shown that the carriers want to share it because it is their lowest cost and fastest time-to-market,neg,train
So I take-- and I don't believe it's just one carrier who's saying,neg,train
"I think that's because a portion of it came in, in 2017, when we previously had expected it was all going to be in '18 because we weren't closing until January of 2018",neg,test
"But once you get past that, it's hard to break anything else out because we're using the same asset to deliver a very similar service to multiple customers",neg,train
"So what we're trying to do, as Jay pointed out, that it works so well on towers, you just leverage that infrastructure again and again",neg,train
"So we actually believe that the appropriate breakdown of this business is what we've done now, which is towers and fiber, and we don't see that changing going forward",neg,train
"This conference call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and actual results may vary materially from those expected",neg,train
Information about potential factors which could affect our results is available in the press release and the Risk Factors sections of the company's SEC filings,neg,train
"Our statements are made as of today, January 25, 2018, and we assume no obligations to update any forward-looking statements",neg,train
Our focus on creating value for shareholders has resulted in a 14% compound annual growth in AFFO per share since we adopted that metric in 2007,neg,train
"Over that same period, we have delivered a 13% total annual return, more than doubling that of the S&P 500",neg,test
"So again, I don't want to speak specifically to the circumstances of these, but generically, I would tell you it's more likely to be related to amendment activities than it would be new leases",neg,train
"Our attempt given the change in timing and the movement that that had on the numbers, we were trying to keep things simple",neg,train
"So I think our plan, and as we go through the course of the year, maybe we'll rethink this, but our current plan was for calendar year 2018 to just leave the disclosure and the plan the same",neg,train
"So for all of '18, we leave new leasing from Lightower in the acquired bucket",neg,train
"We thought that was a little more streamlined and simple in terms of understanding, so we didn't have too many moving pieces",neg,train
We increased our outlook for site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA to reflect 2 long-term customer agreements signed during the quarter,neg,train
These agreements included contracted new leasing activity and term extensions on existing leases,neg,train
"On your second question around DISH, again, I don't want to get into any specific customers, and so I won't speak to the conversations that we're having with them",neg,test
"I would tell you, broadly, we haven't included anything in our 2018 outlook related to the deployment of that spectrum",neg,train
There is a meaningful amount of spectrum that's lying fallow in the hands of various potential users of wireless network,neg,train
"We think we'll benefit from the deployment of that spectrum as it's deployed in the coming years, but it's not included in our 2018 outlook",neg,train
"I was interested in just sort of the traditional enterprise fiber business going back to, say, Sunesys and how that has trended and then perspectively or how things are going kind of on the Lightower side and broader just kind of the non-telecom -- or the non-mobile infrastructure fiber assets and how to think about the growth out there",neg,train
"And then secondly, I was interested in your thoughts on the DISH spectrum and opportunities for seeing some activity on your towers from that deployment",neg,train
"I also noticed that the acquisition -- now with several months of Lightower under your control, it looks like you've lowered the acquisition and integration expense by about $19 million",neg,test
I was just wondering what you've seen that underlies that,neg,train
"As we look beyond 2018, we're excited by the opportunity we see ahead to leverage our unique portfolio of assets to drive long-term growth as our customers make significant investments to keep pace with the rapid growth in data demand",neg,train
"Robert, that construction business tends to be heavily weighted towards the back half of the year",neg,train
"So part of what you saw in the quarter-over-quarter moves in calendar year 2017, I would tell you it's not an unreasonable expectation",neg,train
"As you look at the business, I would expect later quarters in the year to have more CapEx than earlier quarters, just generally speaking",neg,train
The move year-over-year has to do with the scale of the business and how much bigger our business is because of the amount of activity,neg,train
"Richard, again, I don't think we're going to comment specifically on the customer agreements",neg,train
"So we're in constant dialogue, as you would expect, with each of our customers, and these things develop as they do in the normal course of conversation",neg,train
And also a validation that the fiber-fed small cell is the preferred method at this point given the data that's going to have to be moved across the small cell network,neg,train
"So I think that what it shows, like Jay is saying, is there's a lot of activity",neg,train
There's just too much work to go around to expect that we're going to get all of it more than we want to necessarily,neg,train
"In the 3G, 4G environment, if you try to compare that to 5G today, it's difficult to make the comparison",neg,test
"One, we're at the conversation stage around 5G, so we don't believe hardly any of the activity that we're currently seeing is really 5G-related",neg,train
"In a 5G environment, the densification that's required is a stairstep change from what has happened in the past",neg,train
"So just wondering, should we be expecting a change? Because that was unchanged, I think, from initial guidance to new guidance",neg,train
Should we think that there could be a movement to the higher end of the leasing activity and maybe the higher end of churn now that Lightower will have 2 months out of the newbuild acquisition category?,neg,train
"Next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research",neg,train
I wanted to touch upon or go back to some of the prior questions around how you're looking at sort of co-location opportunities versus self-fulfillment,neg,train
"We've seen a number of announcements in which carriers, one in particular, are working with cable providers in order to provide additional densification",neg,train
"One, do you see that as a -- does that fall into the banner of sort of the self-fulfillment opportunity that you guys mentioned? And obviously, you folks have made very strong investments into the fiber world",neg,train
Do you believe that those types of assets can provide the necessary backhaul capacity that you expect to need to support the kind of traffic growth that you're expecting down the future?,neg,train
Turning first to fourth quarter 2017 results on Slide 4,neg,train
"I want to walk through a few items that should be considered when comparing the results to our prior outlook, including the Lightower acquisition that closed earlier than expected on November 1 and was not included in that outlook",neg,train
"When compared to prior outlook, Lightower contributed approximately $140 million, $83 million and $79 million to site rental revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, respectively",neg,train
"Backing out the incremental contribution from Lightower, fourth quarter site rental revenues would have been $910 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been $624 million, and AFFO would have been $433 million",neg,test
"Additionally, site rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA benefited from approximately $5 million of straight-line impacts associated with the customer agreements that Jay mentioned earlier",neg,test
"And finally, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO were impacted by approximately $10 million of costs associated with additional accruals for annual bonuses relating to our 2017 outperformance as well as some severance-related expenses that were not included in our prior outlook",neg,train
"With that, April, I'd like to open the call to questions",neg,train
"3x leverage pro forma for a full quarter's contribution from Lightower, which is down nearly 0",neg,test
"So again, I don't want to get into specifics about what we did or didn't do, but we'd be open to both",neg,train
"With regards to Lightower, I think you've done the math correctly, or you've repeated the numbers that we've given accurately",neg,train
So we'll see how the year plays out and then update based on our performance and what our outlook is for future periods,neg,train
So Sprint has recently signed two deals with Altice and Cox to leverage their backhaul infrastructure for small cells,neg,train
I just want to get your impression on any thoughts around how these agreements impact your view on the lease-up potential for your -- the fiber that you've been acquiring,neg,train
"Colby, on your first comment, again, we're hesitant to get into any specifics around the lease agreements that we signed with our customers for lots of reasons",neg,train
"Well, we're continuing to do some work in trials at the edge",neg,train
"We believe that part of the driver of the devices that are going to be used, whether it's augmented reality, virtual reality, autonomous cars, a lot of the Internet of Things applications, the latency required in order to make those devices work effectively is going to require not only high-speed fiber, dense fiber networks and close proximity to the locations where they are distributed from things like small cells, but it's also going to require computing power at the very edge of the network",neg,train
"As I mentioned in the comments, we've done 2 other large acquisitions in 2017 that we're in the middle of integrating into the portfolio",neg,train
So it's going to take us a little bit of time to digest,neg,test
"It needs to be high-capacity fiber in dense urban areas, and that is a relatively limited targeted set of assets",neg,train
And I don't know that there will be another asset that will be of interest to us,neg,train
We're pleased with what we found so far and glad the assets are performing in line with our expectations as we went through diligence,neg,train
"The services business is tied to new leasing activity, and leasing activity, as we're suggesting in 2018, slightly up on the tower side from 2017",neg,train
So let's now turn and talk a little bit about the businesses themselves,neg,train
"First, we talk about LoyaltyOne, which consists of our Canadian business AIR MILES as Charles again sort of highlighted",neg,train
"In my mind, we setout to do five things, and I think four out of the five came through",neg,train
"Most importantly after the crisis last year, we stabilized the model with number of changes that we made and specifically we came in the mid 20% EBITDA margins, which was our goal, and very pleased to see that that has stuck",neg,train
"Frankly, the biggest news that everyone is been waiting for is the stabilization of the credit loss rate where there after two years of absorbing increases, and we’re poised now to return to mid-to-high teens core EPS growth rate in 2018, which quite frankly is our long-term model",neg,train
So it's been a bumpy couple of years and we're right where we wanted to be for the slingshot for 2018,neg,train
57 per share starting in Q1 and with that let's put 2017 behind us and move right into 2018 and talk about guidance,neg,train
"As always joining me is Charles Horn, who is preparing himself for about the 20 questions on tax",neg,train
And we will also update you on the fourth quarter full-year results,neg,train
"I'll give a wrap up of 2017, and then we're going to get right into 2018 and the trends we are seeing by business, and we are going to get after it",neg,train
"So with that being said, I’ll just kick it over to Charles right away",neg,train
The 2018 summary is the two-year credit normalization process is over,neg,train
We are back as a company to mid-to-high teen’s earnings growth,neg,train
Free cash flow will be very robust with over $1,neg,train
"Right now, we've only allocated roughly 500 of that to support regulatory capital and dividends",neg,train
"So over $1 billion of unencumbered free cash flow, and we feel very good about 2018",neg,train
BrandLoyalty unfortunately had a – frankly there is no other way to put it,neg,train
And I think we got a little bit comfortable with three straight years of strong double-digit growth of topline and EBITDA,neg,train
The program just kept rolling along and then we just had frankly it fell off a cliff in 2017 and we had very poor results,neg,train
But we didn't want to cloud the actual performance and frankly exiting the year to plus seven topline is a very good signal as we move into next year,neg,train
So we think we're getting a handle on that sort of mid single-digit growth rate,neg,train
"Card Services as Charles said even with 90 basis point increase in loss rates, still managed to deliver EBITDA, net of all these provision costs and funding costs and everything else of double-digit, so nice job there",neg,train
"Charles, just last question and I'll turn it back to the queue",neg,train
"But on the tax side, it's great to see your guidance unchanged backing out the tax benefit implicit in your 2018 guidance",neg,train
"Just curious in terms of the assumptions for the tax benefit, I mean I think we had estimated a little bit higher than the $1",neg,train
50 or so you're guiding? And I know there's a $0,neg,train
"But even with that, is there any other items we should just be aware of in terms of conservatism in your tax profile adjustments or tax estimates for the year?",neg,train
"The story line for 2017 is all about the faster than expected stabilization of the technology platform business, which finished strong with 7% growth",neg,train
Revenue growth in the fourth quarter as the offering stabilized through the sale of more packaged offerings and record volumes through our harmony digital messaging platform,neg,train
The other two big drivers of growth Auto and Conversant CRM finished the fourth quarter and year with double-digit revenue growth,neg,test
"Auto continues to benefit from ongoing penetration to new OEMs, while Conversant CRM cross-line efforts continue to gain traction, in particular, as this digital capabilities are now embedded in both auto and technology platform offerings",neg,train
"Look, we don’t – the areas that we need to continue to show consistency that would be Epsilon and Conversant; we've had a good run in 2017 frankly",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens,neg,train
"So if you look at 2017, our effective tax rate was 33%",neg,train
We're guiding to 26% to 27% effective tax rate in 2018,neg,train
"To Darrin’s point, it does assume that will get a little pressure from the States",neg,train
"You’ve read what's going on in New York, New Jersey, California",neg,train
They could – the States could look to grab some of that federal savings,neg,train
"So there is a little bit of conservatism built in there, but the state rates could go up in 2018 versus 2017, which is why we set the bar at 26% to 27% effective tax rate in 2018",neg,train
"So if you look on the chart here in 2016, 1",neg,train
8% meant to roughly 26% of gross losses were recovered,neg,train
"In 2017, we received much less when we sold those accounts, our recovery rate fell to 16%, and therefore, it added 60 basis points to the net loss rate or two-thirds of the total",neg,train
"Again, for those of you who recall the end of 2016 that's when – that was a big question on our largest chunk of the business with technology platform, which is about over a quarter of all of Epsilon Conversant, and that was a bit of a melting iceberg at that point is down 13% year-over-year in Q4 of 2016",neg,train
I think David it's hangover from what took place in the fourth quarter of 2016 around the expiry,neg,train
Obvious we had a number of things going on this year,neg,train
"We need to get Bank of Montreal renewed, which we did around the third quarter that should help",neg,train
"And I do think in the grocery vertical, we just need to get them back satisfied, get the consumers back in their stores and that by itself will lead to getting promotional activity back, but I would attributed to purely hangover from the Q4 2016 event",neg,train
"In the mid-teens, Charles that's a 12/31 versus 12/31 guidance average apples-to-apples?",neg,train
Non-store sales growth was driven by both the increase in buyers and spends per buyer and that's 3% and 2% respectively,neg,test
This growth came from an increase in omnichannel buyers reflecting our continued strategy to help brands engage customers in all relevant channels,neg,train
I think the Canadian business we’ve set the bar I think at a reasonable level,neg,train
"So the goal for 2017 was stabilized, get the margins back to the mid-20s",neg,train
"For 2018, frankly Darrin we’re talking 2% to 3% type growth which should certainly be doable",neg,train
"What we do is, obviously, we've got roughly 160 clients, actually a lot of the core clients that we had wound up doing a bit better in [indiscernible] holiday than I think a lot of people had anticipated",neg,train
"There also what we do is, we look at, Darrin, the vintages that we've signed not just in 2017, but 2016 and 2015 and see how they're ramping up and when they're going to layer into the 2018 growth pipeline",neg,test
Growth rate in the book of business is quite strong 15%,neg,train
"Frankly, I feel that's a good number for us to shoot for on a yearly basis",neg,train
"If you were to look back the last five years, I think the numbers are closer to 20%",neg,test
But I think 15% is a very solid number that gives us a lot of flexibility when it comes to signing new clients and also being very selective on renewals,neg,train
"Operating expenses were up 7% compared to revenue growth at 13%, so very strong expense leveraging",neg,train
"The net loss rate was 6% for the year at 90 basis points over 2016, 60 basis points of the increase was due to lower recovery rates and 30 basis points due to higher gross losses",neg,train
"Also as Charles mentioned, our two big growth area is digital CRM and the auto offerings were both up strongly double-digit",neg,train
"There was a bit of a concern in Q3 whether the digital CRM, which had fallen off in terms of growth rate, whether that was an air-pocket",neg,train
"Fortunately, it was and as a result, you saw a nice pick up in Q4",neg,train
"On the call today, we have Ed Heffernan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance Data; and Charles Horn, Chief Financial Officer of Alliance Data",neg,train
"We've looked back, Oh! Gosh, if you went back prior five years, our average growth rate has been 22%",neg,train
"If you layer in the vintages, what you're seeing with the ramp up of the IKEAs and stuff like that the 15% looks certainly doable",neg,train
"Yes, we went through this whole recovery in-house versus selling to third parties, post great recession where we raised same type of issue and we had to bring things back in-house",neg,test
"All right, it's pretty simple math at a certain level",neg,train
What we have found so far because we're about six months into this process is that much like we had anticipated,neg,train
"If I were to put a number on it, the recovery rates internally are probably somewhere around 20% to 22% of your gross loss rates",neg,train
"Probably the couple of things that we still need to work on, one is, look the model stabilized, but it has not yet kicked into adding to our growth rate at ADS",neg,train
Now that it's been stabilized into growth rate mode and that’s the job for 2018,neg,train
"All right, so it’s maybe another 100 basis points or so above what it otherwise would have been or…?",neg,train
Gross loss rates stabilized as 2017 progressed as we reached the end of the credit normalization cycle,neg,train
"The delinquency trend or wedges we call it closed within 10 basis points at year end, excluding the transitory impact of the hurricanes",neg,test
"Yes, Jason from an EBITDA margin standpoint, think of technology platform being in the 18% to 20% range",neg,train
"But it looks like factoring in same-store sales of about a point, we will get tender share of course and so we're thinking 4% or 5%, and then the rest will come from the big books of businesses that we've signed in 2017, 2016 and 2015",neg,train
"Yes, we have not factored in any acquisitions of portfolios in 2018",neg,train
"On the negative side, I would say it's a bit more from a macro perspective",neg,train
"It's both a tech offering, but it's also a services offering and from a macro perspective, we're going to be watching very carefully the impact of the tight labor market for hard skills",neg,test
"Let me just start off on the Card business, from an outlook perspective, and you're talking about mid-teens receivables growth, the like again",neg,test
And I know the year ended off with a slightly slower growth rate and it was closer to 10% in the December month,neg,train
So I just want to be clear on the credit recoveries,neg,train
"It sounds like we have some noise with the hurricanes maybe in the first quarter, but taking it in-house and the changes you made, I mean, shouldn’t the recovery rate shouldn’t there be a tailwind to your net charge-off rate or are you expecting that still kind of flat versus the 2017 level?",neg,train
"So where the folks who will sit there and hopefully use predictive analysis and more and more the telematics, the data that comes out of the dashboard that basically will say, let's through a text on an email or a big card in your mailbox, it say, hey Andrew, it looks to me like you're about a week and a half away from when it's time to get your oil changed come on over to the dealership and we'll give you a great deal",neg,train
That's the type of stuff that we will be doing,neg,train
"So first I have to ask a question on credit, but on the in-house question efforts that you've had so far, so I know its early days, but given the 60 basis point headwind you had in 2017",neg,train
"What are you seeing so far in your experience that maybe can give us some encouragement? And then also how you think about the level of credit reserves that you keep? We've had some good provision performance recently, but just kind of wondering how you think about credit reserves",neg,train
The recovery market for sales of written-off accounts got to be very challenging for us,neg,train
And again for people who don't live this there's two stages,neg,train
"One is, when you go delinquent, some people call that a recovery process for the first – for the next 180 days",neg,train
"It's certainly one of our advantages, but what we are talking about is post write-offs",neg,test
"So after 180 days after we write-off the account, we sell some of that paper to the third-party",neg,train
We normally recover between 22% and 25% of gross losses,neg,train
"Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements",neg,train
These statements are subject to the risks and the uncertainties described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC,neg,train
Alliance Data has no obligation to update the information presented on the call,neg,train
"I would say across the board, our card clients are asking not only for the type of insight into their existing customers",neg,train
But they also want to be able to say let me take a look at my best customers,neg,train
How do I go out and find people similar to that that may not be customers today,neg,train
"And then finally, on the earnings per share, we had guided to roughly $18",neg,train
"23 and then a little over a buck coming from the tax benefit, which consisted both of the benefit itself less about $12 million that we allocated to non-executive bonuses coming out of the Tax Reform Act",neg,train
"Beginning back in 2015, we carried up to 13 months coverage all the way through the third quarter of this year",neg,train
We trimmed it back to 12 basis points favorable trends,neg,train
"Could you drill down a little bit more into the mid-teens portfolio growth assumption for 2018 for Card Services? More specifically, could you talk about your assumption for same-store credit sales and what the breakdown of that would be between expectation for same-store sales of your existing retailers versus expected wallet share gain?",neg,test
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
We expect stable delinquency rates and that will lead to stable loss rates,neg,test
"And so if you look at the loss rates in the composition of loss rates, what you'll see is, it's kind of interesting that the gross loss rates were up only 30 basis points last year and better than the 50 basis points we had initially forecast",neg,train
By now you should have received a copy of the Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings release,neg,train
"Double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, so obviously that includes absorbing the 90 basis point increase in losses, and frankly getting that done I thought was outstanding",neg,train
"On the negative side, what did we miss? We missed the third-party recovery market which I'll talk about in a little bit, absolutely plummeted",neg,train
"And as a result, it lowered our recovery rates dramatically",neg,train
"And if you look at that 90 basis point increase in net losses, we thought it would be more like 50 basis point",neg,test
"What it turned out to be was gross losses were only up 30 basis point, and so we lost it on the recovery side when the market cratered",neg,train
I think it’s actually an office that we've built over there these are Alliance Data employees just like the folks here,neg,train
So it's very much keeping it within the family type approach,neg,train
"I would expect we're going to have 2,000 folks over there and no I don't think it's on its course in terms of the cost model itself",neg,train
"The second would be to establish an innovation fund to get – to make sure one on the leading edge of the various digital payment products that are out there, and then the third would be to bolster some employee benefits whether it's getting the 401(k) participation rate up or holding down any increases on the benefits",neg,train
The premiums on various healthcare packages for the employees we want to help out there,neg,train
"It's a growing market, right, as you know, it really comes down to the CMO needs to decide whether she wants to have the thing built in-house and have a big tax back, meaning let's get a SaaS-based solution and surround it with 100 tech people or now that we can have a similar price point to that offering and do it ourselves",neg,train
And that's the beauty of what Conversant can do with its unique ID,neg,train
"We can take all those characteristics and then go find these folks, and on behalf of the clients get something really exciting that could motivate them to show up either online or in store at our clients",neg,train
And that's sort of a new area that we're really beginning to expand,neg,train
"5 billion to the growth rate in 2018 plus the core we expect to be in growth mode, modest growth mode, add another $1 billion, so you're at $3",neg,train
"And so we've put in a fair amount of squish there to get us to the 15%, which means it could be a tad bit higher or right at 15%, but that looks like a good number",neg,train
"Turning to the all important holiday season, overall credit sales increased to 8% with strong performance from our recent vintages",neg,train
On a comparable brand basis credit sales were up 5% over last year,neg,train
"The growth was fueled by continued non-store spend, up 11%, which includes digital and web channels",neg,test
"I don't think it will hurt 2018 per se, but what we will do is, we will make for a tough grower for 2019",neg,test
"So from a macro perspective, it’s more retailer specific, a handful we've sort of identified, it's no more than a handful",neg,train
"It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr",neg,test
We were successful in introducing small changes that allowed AIR MILES EBITDA margins to return to the mid-20's range,neg,train
"On the other hand, AIR MILES issued came in short of expectations, down 4% for 2017",neg,train
"Softness in promotional activity, especially in the grocery vertical, caused the shortfall",neg,train
Second BrandLoyalty as we also talked about usually runs at a solid double-digit top and bottom,neg,train
"We did have a very poor year in 2017, which means we expect a very strong snapback in 2018",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust,neg,train
"And then finally, we want to have more consistent better visibility on the financial results",neg,train
"I think 2017 was a good start, but this still works there",neg,train
"All right, Card Services, as Charles mentioned the fabulous wedge that we put out, I don't know 15 months ago which is our best predictor of future losses, as everyone knows",neg,train
We started it was up year-over-year about 50 basis points and that's where we sort of said look we think losses will be up about 50 basis points,neg,test
"The new partners we have signed this year been a great reflection of where the market is growing and what consumers value, brands like IKEA and Viking Cruises being valued for the product and experiences they provide and Build",neg,train
com been a strong e-tailer in a growing category for ADS,neg,train
There's a big market for companies that want to run and they get SaaS-based solutions and they hire IT staff and they go do their things,neg,train
And so that's why I think this is something that right now certainly seems sustainable based on the book of business we signed,neg,train
Our goal for Epsilon entering [indiscernible] top and bottom line growth,neg,test
"The strong finish to 2017 allowed us to hit the 5% revenue growth target, and on apples-to-apples basis, we also achieved the 5% adjusted EBITDA target",neg,train
The difference to the reported decline of 1% is the restoration of $29 million in incentive compensation versus zero last year,neg,train
"If everyone could turn to the slide titled 2017 full-year, this is sort of more of the commentary part of the call",neg,train
"I don't have a lot to add from the numbers perspective, but I would call out two items on the slide",neg,train
"When as Charles mentioned, the goal for the year was mid single-digits top and bottom on an apples-to-apples basis, we believe we accomplished that",neg,train
"Also, on today's call, our speakers will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe will provide useful information for investors",neg,train
Reconciliation of those measures to GAAP will be posted on the Investor Relations website at www,neg,train
"Epsilon, consistency, consistency, and consistency, we want to see minimum of mid single-digit top and bottom",neg,train
"We expect the tech platform, now that it’s turned to actually turn into growth along with auto and the Conversant CRM",neg,train
"With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Heffernan",neg,train
"Think of it David, we divested $800 million in December",neg,train
So you know for the full-year in terms of average this going to be part of it,neg,train
"So basically it means that there's another $200 million potential over the course of the year that we could look at evaluate, do a held-for-sale or it could be a retailer that goes away",neg,train
So simply the bulk of it was the divestiture we made at the end of December,neg,train
"If you look at the clients, it's interesting that they differ across verticals and across physical presence versus strictly e-commerce",neg,train
"com, Viking, Guess, Diamonds, Adorama and IKEA represent sort of what we're beginning to see now which is different from the more traditional model of mall-based soft good apparels",neg,train
Again the delta between the reported number for EBITDA and the 5% growth rate is the restoration of the incentive comp or bonus program,neg,test
"So if you - said differently if you went back the prior year, there was zero payout, which we don't believe is sustainable in this market and therefore we wanted to make sure we were highly competitive as we move into 2018",neg,train
Is it okay to give up controls of the guts of this thing and just have the results forward through into her shop,neg,train
So he or she can just have a bunch of analysts to look at the results,neg,train
"All right, big question, tax bill, tax bill, tax bill",neg,test
"The tax bill will provide us with $100 million, roughly $100 million a year in additional free cash flow",neg,train
"We're going to take that $100 million and obviously flow through, roughly two-thirds of it and we're going to take between 30% and 33% in cloud that back into the company",neg,train
We could do a modicum of buyback obviously the dividend that there is well,neg,train
"But I would say is expect M&A to be a relatively low priority at this point, really the focus is to get all three of our segments back fine",neg,train
"But really where the 90 basis point increase came from, two-thirds of it came from, again, as I talked about the third-party recovery market, which fell off a cliff",neg,train
"On the Auto side, what's interesting is the bulk of the work that we do both for the OEM and for the various dealerships, thousands and thousands of dealerships",neg,train
"Really is more after the sale is made, so it's much more in terms of service",neg,train
"So that doesn't have the type of variability you'll have with everything is driven off of sales, new car sales",neg,test
Your last question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities,neg,test
"And then just on Epsilon, the technology platform revenue it grew 7% in the quarter, so it was a nice improvement on the growth rate there",neg,train
Can we sustain that level and can you just help us understand kind of the drivers of that and then kind of the margin profile of that revenue versus the rest of Epsilon?,neg,train
And I'd like Charles to just very briefly talk about it,neg,test
Maybe this goes back to spirit of some of Darrin questions,neg,train
"But Ed, maybe you could just talk about where you see the largest risks to your outlook? I know there's a lot of positive things happening underneath it all, but maybe you can just talk about what you're worried about to the extent that you are worried about anything",neg,train
"And then as far as tax reform, can that help Card Services in Epsilon as consumers benefit from that and businesses look to reinvest? I'm just trying to think through the impact?",neg,train
"If there's one place of risk at the overall level, it's certainly not with the consumer",neg,train
"Good morning, and welcome to the Alliance Data Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
"At this time, all parties have been placed in a listen-only-mode",neg,train
"Following today's presentation, the floor will be open for your questions",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] In order to view the Company's presentation on the website, please remember to turn off your pop-up blocker on your computer",neg,train
"Absolutely going to be – when it's fully up and running, it should be – you should think 22% versus 16% that we did in 2017",neg,train
So from that perspective if you had flat delinquencies which we have and you're going to see flat gross loss rates and you get this tailwind on the recoveries,neg,train
"As the year progresses, it certainly suggests that we're going to be in decent shape",neg,train
"Excluding the net tax benefit, core EPS increased 12% to $5",neg,train
"33 for the full-year, better than our guidance of $18",neg,train
"The recently enacted tax reform lowered the provision for income tax for the fourth quarter of 2017 and full-year by reducing our net deferred tax liabilities, essentially reducing cash taxes that we would have had to pay in the future",neg,train
Let's move on to the next slide and talk about LoyaltyOne,neg,train
"AIR MILES made expectations and we restored the profitability of the level we anticipated, while BrandLoyalty results were unexpectedly poor",neg,train
"And that's something that we are working on right now to make sure that it's not just the every day spend that gets rewarded, but we want a big chunk of the promotional spend as well",neg,train
"So overall, I would say the Canadian business did a nice job, following the crisis the year before",neg,train
"So against our marketplace that was paying us 25%, it certainly made sense to go outside",neg,train
"However, that 25% dropped all the way down to 16% during 2017",neg,train
"So as we gradually move that up to the 20%, 22% in-house that's what we're seeing, and that's why I think we feel very good about where the net loss rate trend is going to be this year, from a gross loss perspective, it’s going to be flat",neg,test
And just last question quickly on the AIR MILES business,neg,train
You've noted obviously for several quarters the challenges in issuance growth associated with the Grocery segment,neg,train
"So similar to the past, we know we can do better in house",neg,train
That process started in earnest in late fall and will be complete by Q2 of 2018,neg,train
"All right, what's it all mean? We're trying – Charles and I are trying to answer every single delinquency loss question here",neg,train
So we don't have 100 of them after the call,neg,train
"Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  8:30 AM ET",neg,train
"In terms of the product itself, what we basically had there was the traditional Epsilon product release, big iron type database is in loyalty platforms that were highly customized for each and every client and they were just massive, right",neg,test
"They dealt with tens of millions of customers or clients, all the bells and whistles in the world, and they were frankly pretty cool",neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
"Let's talk about LoyaltyOne, which is our Canadian business and BrandLoyalty, we expect high single-digit revenue, low double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth",neg,train
"Now we would like to see, it begin to return to incremental growth",neg,train
"So it's not just taking care of the existing best customers that's obviously job number one, but it's now moving into help me take a profile of my best customer and then go out into space there and find someone similar and then get them all excited about the brand",neg,train
And that is an area that's getting our clients very excited because it's going to drive sales and that's sort of the bottom line,neg,train
"As more and more data comes from the telematics side of it, we'll be able to bug you all day long about your mission level and all these other things that we will be making sure you don't break down out there in California",neg,train
So that's sort of it on the auto side from the CRM side,neg,test
"From the CRM side, look the huge verticals thus far have been retail",neg,train
I think David we are taking a fairly conservative view based upon what we've seen over the last year or so,neg,train
"So for the core clients, the folks who've been with us for three or more years, what we have seen is they've gone from probably negative 2% or 3% to the last quarter",neg,train
"They were probably, which is broke the surface of the water probably 0% to 1%",neg,train
So we're assuming same-store sales are probably not going to be better than 1% for those core retailers,neg,test
"By the end of the year, for me, it should have closed",neg,train
That would have been a nice finish to the year,neg,train
"We did have some noise from the hurricanes, but look the trends are friend at this point and it's effectively closed",neg,train
That means that the outlook for 2018 gives us comfort that stable loss rates will follow,neg,train
Again sort of that mid single-digit organic top and bottom line is what we’re looking for,neg,train
The delinquency flows suggest stable gross losses and in-house recovery process will be done by Q2,neg,train
"So after an elevated Q1 to these transitory items, Q2 through Q4, we expect flat to better versus prior year on loss rates and to make up for the Q1 noise with favorable comps in Q2 to Q4",neg,train
Tender share grew more than 160 basis points in Q4 and more than 100 basis points for the full-year,neg,train
"The growth rate in the fourth quarter dipped slightly to 13% as we divested approximately $800 million of non-core program receivables in December, which hurt receivables growth by about 2%",neg,train
"The key thing to keep in mind and looking at the reserve quality of the reserve coverage is that Signet fall came on late in the year, close to $1 billion",neg,train
"The losses embedded with the forward recorded net, so there is no reserve attributable to it",neg,train
"And then finally, more macro issue, obviously, everyone knows about the retail environment",neg,train
"Full-year, decent year, revenue up 8%, core EPS up 14%, while the tax penny, up 8% excluding the penny",neg,train
Leverage at the corporate level was very modest at 2,neg,train
"7 and that included the impact of funding over $1 billion for buybacks and capital for growth in the portfolio, so good generation of free cash flow for the company",neg,train

Tax reform also benefits us moving forward as we expect our effective tax rate to drop to 26% to 27% in 2018 and that compares to 33% in 2017 prior to the adjustment we just talked about,neg,train
We also anticipate the cash benefit to approximate $100 million to cash flow in 2018,neg,train
Our net corporate debt ended the year at approximately $5,neg,train
"9 billion, while the corporate leverage ratio ended the year at 2",neg,train
I was going to ask about – I appreciate that,neg,train
"On the LoyaltyOne side, just to be clear, I mean I understand BrandLoyalty has a ton of different new business coming on World Cup, Olympics, Disney et cetera",neg,train
"Just give us more color on the overall confidence on that business, not just, I mean on the LoyaltyOne, on the AIR MILES side specifically in terms of the overall guidance high single-digit revenue",neg,train
"What do you need for the AIR MILES business to do for that business overall LoyaltyOne to deliver the guidance, you are giving high single-digit revenue growth",neg,train
"Second, we renewed our largest client Bank Montreal, which is critical to the ongoing success of the program",neg,train
"And then finally, we wanted to get the folks excited about the program again and that comes through with active collectors",neg,train
Active collectors were all the way back to pre-crisis levels by Q4,neg,train
In technology side – to the extent you're winning more there and your win rates look better,neg,train
Are these competitive takeaways or are they buy versus build decisions that you're swaying?,neg,train
Let’s flip to the next slide and talk about Card Services,neg,test
"Facing the headwinds of the second year of credit normalization, Card Services still delivered with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for 2017",neg,train
"Looking at the key performance metrics, credit sales increased 6% for the year with apparel brand partner showing consistent improvement as the year progressed, culminating a strong holiday performance",neg,test
"But in terms of the benefits on working across both India and here in the States, we're just beginning to see that",neg,train
So I would expect while there's a nice chunk that we picked up thus far there's probably another chunk to go,neg,train
The big question for me was that in air-pocket or do we have a fundamental issue with the program,neg,train
"Fortunately, we now have visibility on the fact that we've got a huge book of business for 2018 and it looks like it's more like an air-pocket",neg,train
"And in separately on the – I mean the loyalty programs and kind of a loyalty updates, you talked about 15% AR growth in the card side and the signings activity that you're getting",neg,train
I am just kind of wondering how – also that might translate into some growth on the Epsilon side,neg,train
It seems like there seems to be more engagement in the overall loyalty offering that you have and if you can just get more perspective on that? Thanks,neg,train
There's a couple other verticals we’re beginning to look at that whole promise,neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Deleeuw with Piper Jaffray,neg,train
"How about Epsilon, are businesses looking to reinvest some of the upside?",neg,train
"In addition to that, we frankly could no longer sit there and spend six months getting all the bells and whistles on these platforms and we said here's what we can deliver in a two months timeframe",neg,train
"And so we sort of modularized the offering, and lo and behold with the new price point and the time to market being brought from 10 months to two months",neg,train
We found a very receptive audience because a lot of these folks frankly don't want to run the things in-house,neg,train
"So essentially this revenue standard has been out there for quite a while, but it was really in December when AICPA came out with a whitepaper, that basically said that if the locality program does not take inventory risk, meaning we don't – own it we don't carry the inventory into the point of redemption we should record it net, meaning the gross revenue minus the cost of the product redemption to get to a net revenue",neg,train
"And then let's get into the credit stuff, stable delinquency rates, best predictor of future losses",neg,train
Again we started 2017 at about 55 basis points higher,neg,train
"It just about close to 10%, and that's sort of what we're seeing going forward here",neg,train
"I mean, 100% of our card clients are on the loyalty platform developed by Epsilon",neg,train
"The various digital distribution channels such as e-mail, our card clients would use the Epsilon",neg,train
We are right now beginning a bigger push to get the unique sort of identification platform that is Conversant CRM into the hands of our card clients,neg,train
"So petty straightforward of course there's always a little wrinkle, but the revenue itself looks quite strong",neg,train
"Against that there is an accounting adjustment that does not affect cash flow or EBITDA or earnings per share, it's merely geography",neg,train
But it does change the recognition of roughly $350 million in our business in Canada,neg,train
"So it's really organic, I mean in terms of the strength you're seeing is actually organic additional clients?",neg,train
"And we appreciate your patience, and we'll open it up now for Q&A",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays,neg,train
"Obviously, the BrandLoyalty thing was probably the thing that took us all by surprise",neg,train
"And I can – I see the number of programs we've signed, based on prior year, we know how that will flow into earnings growth",neg,train
I don't think we're going to say much more until we actually just print the numbers because we missed so badly during 2017,neg,test
I would say David we're going to be flexible in how we use that,neg,train
"I'd say right now, M&A is probably pretty low on the radar screen",neg,train
We could use some to pay down debt over the course of the year,neg,train
"In Card Services, growth math as they say, we expect roughly mid-teens growth or 15% growth in average credit card receivables",neg,train
"I get a lot of questions about, how do you do the math? And if you look at the signings from 2015 to 2017, those signings are ramping, and let's say combined",neg,train
"The problem was, they cost an awful lot of money and it took anywhere between nine months to 15 months for these things to be delivered and cranked up for the customer",neg,train
"We were frankly a bit slow to make the pivot to transition to a lower cost, quicker delivered product and that's what took us a full-year maybe 15 months to do",neg,train
We opened a large office in India which helped with the price point brought us very competitive with some of the SaaS-based solutions out there,neg,train
"Really nice to see Epsilon back in the mid-to-high single-digit range, I'm wondering if you could provide just a little more color and Auto has been really strong, CRM is doing well",neg,train
"First on auto, could you characterize how you think about the cyclicality of those – of that end market versus sort of structural demand? And then within the CRM offering, are there any verticals in particular that you'd call out as being important drivers? And again I'm just trying to get a sense for the sustainability of the growth in those two really important drivers of Epsilon?",neg,train
What’s it all mean? Q1 will be noisy and will be elevated,neg,test
"The final hurricane flow through will cause gross losses to be elevated, while we will also be refraining from any third-party sales of written-off accounts, which would normally have lowered – which will in fact lower the recovery rates versus prior year",neg,train
"Hey, first question on the card side, just a point of clarification",neg,test
"Ed, when I look at the components of your portfolio growth guidance this year, is the $1 billion subtraction for retailers that ultimately may become non-core, non-growing, is that just a guess in a cushion or are there specific programs you've identified?",neg,train
"Okay, so again from our perspective and from how we're going to be presenting on earnings and stuff, pro-forma, the norms and from our perspective, it's a 12% topline core EPS",neg,train
"Even with the big bump up in 2017, from the $18",neg,train
We're still looking at 16% to 19% growth in 2018,neg,train
"If you want to go back to the original guidance, we said we wanted to do $18",neg,train
35 and we're going to bump up 2018 to $22,neg,train
"50 to $23 of share, representing 16% to 19% growth",neg,train
"We will be rolling out and launching a new source of funding, which will be on the consumer deposit side, out of our ILC facility in Utah and obviously that requires consumer platform",neg,train
We’ll have to come up with some fancy slogan or catchy slogan I guess that will get people excited about what's in their purse,neg,train
Revenue for the fourth quarter came in strong at 15% growth to $2,neg,train
"72 billion, slightly soft to guidance due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacting revenue at Card Services by approximately $80 million",neg,train
Your next question is from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI,neg,train
"Team did a wonderful job of turning it, not only getting the pricing at a level we want",neg,train
"Also, moving from a very customized model where things take 15, 17 months to get to market to a more standard package where we are talking about two to three months",neg,train
"And as a result, what we saw was steady progress and actually exited the year at plus 7% growth for their business",neg,train
We did have a record new vintage this year close to $3 billion for those of you who don't live and breathe in the Card business,neg,train
$3 billion essentially means if you took all the signings that we did over the past year whether it was an existing file or whether it was a file starting from scratch and it takes three years to ramp up,neg,train
"After three years all of these clients together will add roughly $3 billion to the portfolio, and that's how we look at it",neg,train
We have a number of vintages each year that are screwing up,neg,train
"The weakness is due to several reasons; one, key markets Germany and Russia were off due to the absence of events such as the Euro Cup and Olympics, which reduced the number of programs executed",neg,train
do not manifest as it is taking longer to establish the foothold here than we anticipated,neg,train
"And three, the rollout of Disney product offering was delayed to 2018",neg,train
"On a positive note, the backlog for the first quarter – first half of BrandLoyalty looks good in 2018",neg,train
"So would have forced us to do is to look at the travel related redemptions going into 2018, recognize will now have a net recordation for it",neg,train
"To Ed’s points, no impact at all in terms your earnings, any of your earnings metrics obviously bumps up your EBITDA margin appreciably, but it's purely shifting to a net presentation",neg,train
This was something that came very late in the year,neg,train
"We not anticipated to early, not a big impact overall to ADS in terms of revenue, and like I said, no impact to profitability",neg,train
"Yes, I think from some of the reinvestments, I would call out probably two areas",neg,train
The first in terms of reinvestment would be – we have always given the size of the Card business today,neg,train
It was a lot easier when the file was a couple billion as opposed to heading towards $20 billion,neg,train
This morning we announced results for our first quarter of fiscal 2018 and we are excited about our continued strong execution and performance,neg,train
We achieved another record level of quarterly revenue and very strong operating performance driven by the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives and healthy semiconductor industry demand,neg,train
"We continued our momentum from last year in three key product areas: CMP slurries for polishing tungsten, dielectrics slurries, and CMP pads",neg,train
We’ve recently broadened our product portfolio with a family of new pad configurations and continue to win new business for advanced and legacy applications,neg,train
"We continue to believe we can grow our pads revenues over $100 million in fiscal 2019, which would reflect compound annual growth of at least 20%",neg,train
"I am pleased to report that during the quarter, we were awarded a Best Supplier Award from SK Hynix a leading memory device company and a strategic customer",neg,train
Scott will discuss our financial results later in the call,neg,train
"And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Scott for more detail on our financial results",neg,train
"And then just – I guess, in general, can you talk about what raw materials are doing year-over-year and expectations there? And then a specific question around the one deal you have with your former parent Cabot",neg,train
"When that deal rolls off in 2019, once it resets, should we think about being significantly different economics? Or is where the market at today, fairly in line with where that contract is?",neg,train
"It’s early in the year, so we’re going to continue with the guidance that we had",neg,train
"On margin, there is a little bit of a seasonality effect because of our Q1 being the – the December quarter",neg,train
"As we go into March, we do pick up some extra costs with merit increases and some equity grants and things like that",neg,train
So there is a seasonality impact to the margin percentage and the margin metric,neg,train
"And with it being early on in the year, we’re continuing to be comfortable with the guidance that we had",neg,train
"This is notable, since the March quarter is traditionally seasonally softer than the December quarter and sometimes includes volatility in orders around the Lunar New Year holiday",neg,train
"However, I would caution that we have some limited visibility towards near-term revenue",neg,train
We’re always – it’s always going to be competitive out there,neg,test
"We’ve really been delighted with the growth we’ve seen, 17% this quarter year-over-year",neg,train
"We reaffirmed our expectation to grow the business over $100 million by 2019, which would be a 20% CAGR, so really healthy growth and continued growth from what we’ve seen at the start",neg,train
"So we’re seeing both POR wins and just more proliferation within the same customer, which is exciting",neg,train
"Later in the call, Scott will provide commentary on our current view on revenue for the March quarter",neg,test
"Considering a longer term view, two weeks ago our company participated in SEMI Industry Strategy Symposium or ISS in California",neg,train
This annual event early in the calendar year represents a great opportunity to compare views with other industry participants,neg,train
"This theme of this year’s conference was smart, intuitive and connected semiconductor devices transforming the world",neg,train
12 this quarter or diluted earnings per share of $1,neg,train
"19 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the onetime impact of tax reform in the referenced amortization expense",neg,train
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were approximately 29% higher than in the first quarter of fiscal 2017,neg,train
"Now I’ll turn to operating expenses, which include research, development and technical, selling and marketing, and general and administrative costs",neg,train
"4 million reported in the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher staffing related expenses, including costs related to the company’s CFO transition and higher incentive compensation expense",neg,train
"Finally, quarterly revenue from our Engineered Surface Finishes business or ESF, which includes QED Technologies, represented 6% of our total quarterly sales and was up 70% compared to the same quarter last year",neg,train
2 million of amortization expense related to the NexPlanar acquisition,neg,train
"8% of revenue, which is up 290 basis points compared to last year",neg,train
Dielectric slurries representing the second key product area provided 23% of our revenue for this quarter with sales up 8% from the same quarter a year ago,neg,test
"We look forward to winning more business in this area with our higher performing, lower cost and higher profitability products",neg,train
And our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities,neg,train
"We’re going to continue to look at M&A that is going to leverage our core capabilities and then also it needs to be actionable, of course",neg,train
A webcast of today’s conference call and the script of this morning’s prepared comments will also be available on our website shortly after this live conference call,neg,train
"Please remember that our discussions today may include forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements",neg,train
"These risk factors are discussed in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017",neg,train
"As for the March quarter, recall that it is historically seasonally soft, although the consensus is for an overall continued strong demand environment in calendar 2018",neg,train
"We serve all semiconductor manufacturers and have broad exposure across the memory, foundry and logic sectors",neg,train
"And through January, we are seeing continued solid demand for IC CMP consumables products",neg,test
And I also saw their comments about the kind of continued strong demand in DRAM and continued expended strong demand in NAND,neg,train
"So that’s a really important part of the business for us, of course, that transaction is really key as well because there’s a doubling of CMP steps and so – and most of those are tungsten and dielectrics",neg,train
"Recall that, we typically experience an increase in expenses in the March quarter, due to certain factors related to the new calendar year, such as merit salary increases, higher payroll taxes and also cost around our annual meeting in March",neg,train
We are one of only five recipients and the only CMP slurry and pad supplier to be honored by SK Hynix,neg,train
Our company was recognized for delivering best-in-class CMP slurry and pad solutions for their NAND flash and DRAM applications and demonstrating outstanding performance in technology innovation,neg,train
"We have, as you know, 80% of our business is actually in Asia, so we have – and 60% of our cash today is in Asia, so – or is outside the U",neg,train
"So we have a little bit less of an impact in terms of ongoing tax rate, but a potentially greater impact in terms of less friction of moving cash across the world and back to the U",neg,train
And our next question comes from Chris Kapsch of Loop Capital,neg,train
And so we’re excited both on the legacy and advanced side and see a lot of runway,neg,train
"As you might have – as you might know, dielectrics is the largest portion of the CMP slurries market, so a lot of room to grow there",neg,train
"Well, Mike, we benefited here from a great history of cash and operating performance",neg,train
"We won’t comment a lot about the M&A pipeline, but we’re very cognizant about where we sit from a capital deployment perspective, where we sit with the balance sheet today",neg,train
"So speaking of memory pricing, my understanding is that there are some declines actually happening in some of the memory markets for pricing",neg,train
"And just curious, in that kind of environment, how would you expect CCMP’s pricing to hold up?",neg,train
We assume no obligation to update any of this forward-looking information,neg,train
"Also, our prepared remarks this morning reference non-GAAP financial measures",neg,train
Our earnings release includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures,neg,train
"Just a question, you’ve touched on a little bit but with revenue up so strongly, walk us through why R&D in sales and marketing would have been down quarter-over-quarter and then G&A within that was up pretty large",neg,test
Was there a shift in something that last year was kind of R&D you’re selling and this year is in G&A? Can you just walk us through kind of the dynamics where 3 of them – or 2 are down and 2 are up and then is that can extrapolate through the rest of the year?,neg,train
"QED is really not much of a factor with its low percentage of our revenue right now, Chris, so that’s not really part of the story",neg,test
"And it’s a relevant question that you ask about what we’ve delivered this quarter in terms of even GAAP gross profit but then keeping our projection for the rest of the fiscal year, where it was at 50% to 52%",neg,test
And I think you could just think of that in terms of its early in the year,neg,train
I think you said those words as part of your question,neg,train
I’ll conclude my remarks with a few comments on demand for our IC CMP consumables products,neg,train
"During the first fiscal quarter, we saw a 3% sequential increase in revenue from our IC CMP consumable products, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017",neg,train
This is in line with the expected slight increase that we referenced during our call in October,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays,neg,test
We expect the industry transition from 2D to 3D memory will continue over the next several years,neg,train
"As a result, we achieved record revenue in our tungsten product area in the first fiscal quarter and year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 14%",neg,train
"Over the years, we have seen sustain revenue growth from our tungsten products, which reflects our continued leadership and commitment to this important product area",neg,train
"Drilling into revenue by product area, tungsten slurries accounted for 45% of total quarterly revenue",neg,train
Revenue in this area was up 14% compared to the same quarter last year and we achieved record revenue of $63 million in the current quarter,neg,train
"Our – you referenced the former parent, that’s one of the particle suppliers we currently use",neg,train
"In terms of China and growth with the Mainland China, the new fabs that are being built, do you expect to see any volume production happening this year, late in the year? Or do you expect to see more pilot productions this year with volume expected next year? And how that’s changed at all over the last couple of months?",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Amanda Scarnati of Citi,neg,train
"Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (NASDAQ:CCMP) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,test
"Just a follow-up question on cash return and uses of cash and how, if at all, it’s been changed with the tax reform in the U",neg,train
Are you looking to getting a little bit more aggressive in cash usage? Or still kind of building out that cash fund that you have?,neg,train
"Our full fiscal year GAAP gross profit guidance range is 50% to 52% of revenue, which remains unchanged",neg,train
This includes approximately 100 basis points of NexPlanar amortization expense,neg,train
"Wanted to ask about the memory side of the business, one of your customers, who recently gave you an award, mentioned on their earnings calls that they expect DRAM shipment growth of 20% and NAND and shipment growth in the mid-40s",neg,train
Just wondering if you could comment on this 2018 outlook as it compares to your own expectations for the memory side of the business,neg,test
"Higher performing chips with smaller feature sizes and requiring lower power consumption can only be realized through innovations in equipment, materials, design and packaging technologies",neg,train
The additional income tax expense associated with tax reform resulted in a net loss for the quarter of $3,neg,train
"1 million, excluding this one-time impact in the previously mentioned amortization expense",neg,train
"Non-GAAP net income was approximately 33% higher than the same quarter last year, and increased primarily due to higher revenue and higher gross profit margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses",neg,test
"Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was a record $140 million, which represents an approximately 14% increase from the same quarter last year",neg,train
This increase reflects the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives and continued strong global semiconductor industry demand that we have seen over the last seven quarters,neg,train
"Hi everyone, this is actually Arthur on for Edwin, and thanks for taking our questions",neg,train
"During the quarter, we experienced strong demand for our tungsten and dielectric slurries and pad solutions across a wide range of applications and technology nodes",neg,train
This drove approximately 11% year-on-year revenue growth for the quarter for IC CMP consumables products,neg,train
A particular significance we also achieved year-on-year revenue growth for the quarter of approximately 34% in China and 36% in Korea,neg,test
"Our strong positions in these countries are notable, given industry expectations for long-term overall semiconductor growth in China and continued memory growth in Korea",neg,train
"So Arthur, first, just for context, we’re coming off a record quarter for dielectrics last quarter, and we still saw year-over-year growth",neg,train
"And just to remind, we’re really trying to transform that portfolio",neg,train
"So we’ve introduced really two new families of products: one, is ceria-based and one is colloidal silica-based",neg,train
"Both of them offer better cost of ownership, better performance, a better defectivity",neg,train
"So we’ve gone through many, many cycles as part of the industry, and the memory pricing from our customers is something that really, for us, when I think there’s – what we’ve seen historically is when there’s pressure on memory pricing, it’s really not as profound of an impact on materials",neg,train
"But they may pull in CapEx, so it may impact the equipment side a lot more",neg,train
"What happens with the material side is they have those really significant investments in place with their fabs, and they just continue to run them",neg,train
"So from a material side although the CapEx or equipment side may be peaking, we see the material side is still a lot of upside going forward and not as affected by memory pricing at the end markets",neg,test
"So obviously, I spent quite a bit of time there",neg,train
We’ve always had a very strong position on the slurry side,neg,train
"We, of course, have our partnership on the pad side with KFMI, which is just starting",neg,train
We did realize revenue in this fiscal year from the early collaboration in pads,neg,train
"I would say also, just to qualify, some of the revenue from China was also due to strong QED, so that could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter",neg,train
"It’s a really important region for us, and we feel like we are really well positioned",neg,train
"Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was about 108%, compared to 20% in the same quarter last year",neg,train
The significant increase is primarily related to the one time impact of U,neg,train
"tax reform, which increased our income tax expense by approximately $33 million",neg,train
"Excluding this one-time effect, our tax expense would have been approximately $7 million and our tax rate would have been 19%",neg,train
"We currently expect our effective tax rate for the rest of the fiscal year to be within the range of 21% to 24%, including the benefit of a lower tax rate in the U",neg,train
"Before the enactment of tax reform, we had estimated between 24% to 27% for the full fiscal year",neg,train
"This morning we reported results for our first quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended December 31, 2017",neg,train
"A copy of our earnings release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website, cabotcmp",neg,train
com or by calling our Investor Relations office at 630-499-2600,neg,train
"Yes, we follow the same things you do, Amanda, which is to look at when the equipment sales are going in, that construction is being completed",neg,test
"So a lot of those new customers like YMCC and OTRAN [ph], they’re still not only finishing construction, but I think an important element to China’s growth, domestic customer growth is demonstrating that they can achieve technology and an acceptable yield, right? So we’re working closely with many of them",neg,test
"Most of the consensus would be that, that capacity comes online really starting second half of 2018 and that varies by customer",neg,train
"So a lot of that – some of that’s coming from domestic customers that are already in production, like SMIC and Huali",neg,train
"So it’s not just the domestic customers, but also the international customers that are very active in China ramping up their facilities",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
"Now turning to cash and balance sheet related items, capital investments for the quarter were $4 million",neg,train
"For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect capital spending to be within the range of $18 million to $22 million",neg,train
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter was $6 million and we generated cash flow from operations of $31 million,neg,train
Non-GAAP net income increased by approximately 33% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased by approximately 29% compared to last year,neg,test
"In addition, we continued our strong cash flow generation trend with cash from operations of $31 million",neg,train
"To summarize, from a financial standpoint, we’ve now delivered strong performance for seven consecutive quarters, and achieved another record level of quarterly revenue, along with strong operating performance and cash flow for our first quarter of fiscal 2018",neg,train
"We remain focused on delivering innovative, high performing and high quality CMP solutions",neg,train
"And then may be a question for Scott just – you mentioned some of the capital deployment plans that – those haven’t changed, but obviously, you bring some additional perspective, shall we say on M&A",neg,train
Your thoughts may be on the M&A pipeline and kind of the strategy going forward for CCMP,neg,train
Now I’ll turn the call back to the operator as we prepare to take your questions,neg,train
"Yes, it is unusual that we – that we’ve said flat to slightly higher for Q2 revenue, that’s historically, revenue has been down about 4% on average over a number of years",neg,train
"So structurally, there’s less seasonality and less seasonality throughout the year with our business",neg,train
"During the quarter, we realize record revenue of $140 million approximately 14% higher than in the same quarter last year",neg,test
"companies, our net income was significantly impacted this quarter by the one-time effect of U",neg,train
"tax reform enacted in December, which resulted in a GAAP loss of $3",neg,train
"However, non-GAAP net income this quarter was a record $31 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share or $1",neg,train
19 both excluding the one-time impact of tax reform as well as amortization expense related to our 2015 acquisition of NexPlanar,neg,train
"Turning to CMP pads, this quarter we achieved record revenue and year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 16%",neg,train
This was driven by continued strong customer pull for our products,neg,train
We have a rich pipeline of new pad business opportunities spanning a wide range of customers and applications,neg,train
"And as we’ve previously discussed, we continue to experience significantly shorter qualification times than in years past given a unique attributes of our NexPlanar technology",neg,train
Thank you for your time and your interest in Cabot Microelectronics,neg,train
"In addition, we achieved significant growth from our dielectrics slurries with revenue up approximately 8% compared to the same quarter last year",neg,train
This was primarily driven by demand for ceria and colloidal silica-based dielectrics solutions for advanced applications,neg,test
"We believe these CPM solutions provide benefits of high removal rate, improved defectivity and lower cost of ownership",neg,train
Dielectrics represents the largest application within the CMP slurries market,neg,train
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cabot Microelectronics First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode,neg,train
"Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time",neg,test
"[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded",neg,train
"We believe this recognition along with the many other awards we have won over the years from a number of other important customers, is evidence of our long-term commitment to collaborating closely with our customers and our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of best-in-class CMP solutions to the highest standards for quality, performance and technology",neg,train
"Factors impacting gross profit for the quarter compared to last year include higher sales volume, higher value product mix, partially offset by higher fixed manufacturing costs, including higher incentive compensation expense",neg,train
"I think you – in your prepared remarks, you said China was up 34% year-over-year, which is up from 26% year-over-year in the last quarter",neg,train
"David, can you provide some more color on the activity level you are seeing in China and kind of what you are expecting in that region in fiscal 2018?",neg,train
So the first question is just on the dielectrics business,neg,train
"4% year-over-year, which is lower than average year-over-year growth rate of about 20% you saw in fiscal 2017",neg,train
"So obviously, you have with the strong growth in 2017, you should have tougher comps going into fiscal 2018",neg,train
So should we think of this as a new normal growth rate? Or do you think we can return back to this double-digit percentage growth rate as you did in fiscal 2017?,neg,train

There is a distinction the memory producers seem to prefer a ceria-based solution,neg,test
"The logic and foundry customers tend to prefer colloidal silica, so there is some segmentation by customer",neg,train

We currently expect our GAAP operating expenses for the full year to be between $145 million and $150 million,neg,train
Our prior guidance range was $142 million to $147 million,neg,train
It’s been my sincere pleasure to serve as CFO of Cabot Microelectronics,neg,train
I’m very proud of what we’ve accomplished over the years and I look forward to the Company’s continued success in the future,neg,train
In particular I have really enjoyed my interactions with all of our investors and analysts,neg,train
I think Cabot Microelectronics is a great company and it’s been an honor to help tell our story,neg,train
I look forward to working with Scott to assure a smooth and seamless transition,neg,test
"I think as you think about the P&L, we’ve had a number of reclasses and some moving parts within each of the buckets so I think the best way to look at that for the quarter is to focus on the total operating expenses",neg,train
"And as we think about those expenses, at the December quarter last year, we’re $33",neg,train
"9 million this time with the primary item being the cost related to the CFO transition, of which the majority of that is related to cash and non-cash items for the longer-term items that were related to bill’s performance over a long period of time with the company",neg,test
"So it’s going to be – it’s difficult to look at those buckets, good question",neg,test
"But if we focus on the total, we can drill it down for that item",neg,train
"With me today are David Li, President and CEO; Scott Beamer, who joined us as our new CFO earlier this month; and Bill Johnson, who recently retired as CFO",neg,train
"Hi, good morning, and congrats Bill on your retirement, and welcome aboard, Scott",neg,test
"We ended the quarter with $426 million in cash and short-term equivalents and $141 million of debt outstanding, so net cash was approximately $285 million",neg,train
And our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company,neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to Trisha Tuntland, Director of Investor Relations at Cabot Microelectronics",neg,train
"To provide some context for our first quarter results, let me offer some perspectives on the global semiconductor industry environments",neg,train
"As forecast by several of our customers and industry analysts, industry demand was firm during the December quarter and our results are consistent with this as well as the expectations we discussed during our fourth quarter conference call in October",neg,train
"Reports suggest that overall semiconductor demand was driven by continued robust memory market, generally due to the growing requirements for storage in a wide range of end-use applications, as well as a healthy logic market driven by mobile product launches",neg,train
"Two things, one, did QED move the needle at all during this quarter? And, secondly, I know it’s early in the fiscal year, but given the strong performance, given the strong outlook for the memory end market and therefore, your tungsten slurry, high-margin tungsten slurry business, any thoughts on may be lifting the gross margin guidance for the year at this juncture?",neg,train
"I think quarter-to-quarter, you could see some volatility but overall, good trajectory for this product line",neg,train
"Over the last several years, we’ve been very focused and committed to performance and growth and our three key product areas, slurries for polishing tungsten, dielectrics slurries and CMP pads, including slurry and pad consumable sets",neg,train
We continue to see memory as a really important driver of growth for us,neg,train
"As we’ve mentioned, that transition especially on the NAND side, going from 2D to 3D, is really still on the relatively early stages",neg,test
"So you mentioned SK Hynix, who we received their highest supplier honor this past quarter, really important customer of ours",neg,train
"And if you look at that overall conversion, we’re still about – we would estimate or based on what’s out there today, only about 1/3 of the 2D NAND today from a wafer start basis has been converted to 3D",neg,train
"Before we get started, I’d like to note that on December 12, we announced Bill Johnson’s retirement after nearly 15 years of service as our CFO and the appointment of Scott Beamer as our new CFO",neg,train
I want to thank Bill for his many contributions to the company over the years and welcome Scott to his new role,neg,test
We all wish you the best in your future endeavors,neg,train
"Turning to CMP slurries, during the quarter, we continued to grow with the ramp of our customers advanced technologies including 3D NAND and FinFET",neg,train
"As we have discussed in the past 3D NAND and FinFET applications require more CMP steps, mainly tungsten and dielectrics",neg,train
In particular 3D memory requires roughly twice the number of CMP steps as 2D and many of those steps are tungsten,neg,train
This growth opportunity is significant for our business given our leadership in this product area,neg,test
"5% of revenue, which is 370 basis points higher than the same quarter last year",neg,train
"A significant year-over-year increase representing operating leverage driven by revenue growth combined with the company’s ongoing attention to controlling costs and progress toward achieving our multi-year financial objective of expanding profit margins, which we introduced during fiscal 2017",neg,train
We have a tremendous opportunity for continued growth given the strength of our business and the industry in which we operate,neg,train
"I think in the prior quarter, we talked about Roz being higher based on previous contract prices and those were working the way through our balance sheet and ultimately through the P&L",neg,train
So that is behind us now from an impact perspective in the total quarter,neg,train
"The largest raw material that we have are the abrasive products that you mentioned where we have a buying agreement with the former parent company, which – Dave, if you have a comment about 2019 beyond that",neg,test
"I think we’re pleased with our performance so far, what we’ve demonstrated not far from satisfied",neg,train
"But what we see is if you look at those three key product areas, tungsten, as you mentioned, is above our corporate gross margin",neg,test
Dielectrics is we’re transforming that product area should also be positive from a margin standpoint,neg,train
"And then pads, pads is our strong growing area for us",neg,train
"Very excited about that, but it is a headwind versus our corporate gross margin, obviously positive for gross margin dollars",neg,train
"Thanks very much for questions guys, congrats on the great quarter",neg,train
"Earlier, Dave talked about a range of general industry expectations for continued firm demand for memory devices and somewhat softer demand for a logic devices during our second quarter of fiscal 2018",neg,train
"Within this environment, we currently expect demand for our IC CMP consumables products in the March quarter to be flat to slightly higher than the record level of revenue we achieved in our first quarter",neg,train
And then just a follow-up on the dielectric business and I get the longer-term growth there and displacing some matured technologies,neg,train
"The growth there just curious, as you mentioned winning market share versus more commoditized I guess competitive offerings as well as cannibalizing your own lower margin dielectric business",neg,train
"Can – is it – the performance of those new dielectric slurries, it is balanced? Is it – or is the growth more pronounced from cannibalization vis-à-vis market share gains? Can you break that out?",neg,train
"Our expectations are for continued firm near-term demand, sustained solid gross margin performance and ongoing prudent management of operating cost",neg,train
"Based on all this, we believe we are well positioned to deliver another successful – a year of another successful performance in fiscal 2018",neg,test
"Just a last question for me, maybe for you, Scott, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how March quarter IC’s consumable is a trend was better than seasonal",neg,train
Just want to see what are the puts and takes in your March quarter IC consumables trend? Is it mostly strong growth in memory that’s offsetting the TSMC decline?,neg,train
"Sales of polishing pads, our third key product area represented 13% of our total revenue for the quarter and increased 16% compared to the same quarter last year",neg,train
"Sales of slurries for polishing metals other than tungsten, including copper, aluminum and barrier, represented 12% of our total revenue and increased 4% from the same quarter last year",neg,train
"And then one last one I guess, just on the pad business",neg,train
"I mean we're starting to bump into the law of bigger numbers I guess with the growth rate, decelerating a little bit from a function of the success and the growth of that business",neg,train
"But so just on the – what I’m curious is, are you – do you feel like you’re getting as many POR wins and as much momentum in that business commercially as you would have expected when you did the due diligence on the NexPlanar deal? And is there any evidence of any change in competitive behavior from the big gorilla in the room and the pad business, especially considering changes that – at that company? Thank you",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference",neg,train
"This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect",neg,train
Next we’ll go to the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust,neg,train
It’s going to be a credit for us to costs of about $53 million,neg,test
Thanks for all the clarity that you’ve given this morning,neg,train
One question on--can you give us some sort of sense of where you think the rate base for (indiscernible) to get out to 2020 shakes out versus the--I think you have 13,neg,train
"(NYSE:AEP) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2017  9:00 AM ET",neg,test
2017 was a re-basing year following the sale of the competitive generation assets,neg,train
We are pleased with our operating earnings for the year which were achieved despite the headwinds from very mild weather,neg,train
"Okay, and then just finally, do you see this as pretty set, or is there a chance that the numbers shift around a bit depending on how your conversations with states go, which you’re obviously saying are in process?",neg,train
Let’s turn to Slide 12 now and talk about tax reform,neg,train
Remember back two years ago when bonus depreciation was extended,neg,train
"At that time, we were getting increased cash due to not having to pay cash taxes",neg,train
"In response, the company did what Congress had hoped it would do and increased our capital expenditures for the benefit of our customers",neg,train
"This increase in capex had the effect of offsetting increased ADIT balances, so the story that we talked about then was lower cash taxes, increased retained cash, increased capex, increased customer benefits, and steady growth rate",neg,train
"Greg, certainly our guidance that we’ve given, we’re very comfortable with that guidance that we’ve given, and actually Oklahoma is one of our smaller jurisdictions, so--but that being said, we still expect a good outcome in Oklahoma",neg,test
I wanted to see if you guys were prepared to clarify the 5 to 7% growth,neg,test
My understanding is previously it was off a 365 base in 2017 and went through 2019,neg,train
Is that the same way that we should think about it now?,neg,train
"It’s that small portion that was associated with the co-gens that’s not permanent, and again we don’t want to overstate the industrial growth because of that portion, and as we look forward and forecast the full year 2018, we look at what we think are expansions, we look at what we think the growth rate it, and we think we’ve got that forecasted appropriately with the essentially flat that we’re estimating for industrial in 2018",neg,train
"Looking at the drivers by segment, earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1",neg,train
"37 with one of the largest drivers being weather, which had a negative impact of $0",neg,train
"This difference was driven by the warm summer in 2016 which increased our cooling load compared to the warm winter in 2017, which decreased our heating load",neg,test
"Favorable prior year items also contributed to this difference, including formula rate true-ups, recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia, and positive tax adjustments",neg,train
"Other rate relief was favorable due to the recovery of incremental investment across multiple jurisdictions, and we reduced O&M in response to the unfavorable weather in 2017",neg,train
"Additional variances in this segment include higher depreciation and taxes other than income taxes, along with lower AFUDC",neg,train
We think the larger portion of it was really the broad growth across most of our industrial sectors,neg,train
"Commission orders have been received in Texas and Kentucky that were generally constructive, and we await orders in Indiana, Michigan and Oklahoma as well as the ESP case in Ohio",neg,train
"Last, we’ll go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley",neg,train
Next we’ll go to the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan,neg,train
"Nick or Brian, on the Wind Catcher project, there has been some rumblings in the past that maybe a competing transmission line may complicate the overall project",neg,train
Can you talk to that - is that a concern?,neg,train
"More near term, I remember when you laid out your ’18 guidance for us back at EEI, it was assumed in there a certain amount of rate increases from the various rate cases that had been going on and still going on",neg,train
Can you just remind us what percentage of that has currently been locked in?,neg,train
"I was recently asked what song would be a good one to pick for this quarter to illustrate the quarter, and it has to be Taxman by the Beatles",neg,test
"Tax reform has definitely been at the forefront, taking center stage",neg,train
"As we adjust the outcome of tax reform, our focus is no different - allocation of capital, maintaining credit quality, and ensuring our consistent growth trajectory",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Did you say that the major factor that drove industrial demand up in the fourth quarter was these two co-gen facilities shutting down and taking demand from you, and so that’s why you don’t consider that an ongoing trajectory of demand?",neg,train
"Yes, and in terms of just your conviction level on it, it seems like the recommendations so far have generally not been that good in any of the states, or maybe one of them, so I’m just--but you did talk about maybe some settlement talks in certain states",neg,train
"Maybe you could talk about which ones are able, and why you’d be convinced you can still get this moving forward?",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11:15 am today through February 1 at midnight",neg,test
You may access the AT&T Teleconference replay system at any time by dialing 1-800-475-6701 and enter the access code of 441047,neg,train
"Those numbers again are 1-800-475-6701 and 320-365-3844, access code 441047",neg,train
Our OPAB funding improved 18 percentage points during the quarter to 130% primarily due to strong investment returns and a change in the medical coverage for post-65 retirees,neg,test
This change lowered the estimated OPAB liability and annual expense,neg,train
The estimated cost for both plants in 2018 is expected to reduce after-tax expense by $53 million,neg,train
"As you know, we have several rate cases that were filed in 2017 that we expect outcomes generally in early 2018",neg,train
"Rate case filings were made in Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas, and we still have an outstanding ESP case in Ohio that we await the outcome as well",neg,train
"Additionally, as you all know, we’ve filed for state regulatory approvals for the Wind Catcher project in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas",neg,train
Two other questions we often get are related to the deductibility of interest on parent debt and whether or not we have a significant net operating loss carry-forward,neg,train
We expect interest on our parent debt to be mostly tax deductible and we are going into 2018 without a significant net NOL,neg,train
Most of our state commissions have already opened documents related to changes in the tax law,neg,test
We have begun working with regulators to determine the appropriate mechanisms to provide the customer benefits of both the change in tax rate and the excess ADIT,neg,train
"We have several options, including decreasing rates, increasing the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerating depreciation, and offsetting other rate increases",neg,train
"Overall, we’ll maintain our credit metrics in the Baa1 range and stay within our earnings growth rate of 5 to 7% while customers get the benefit of continued investment and lower taxes",neg,train
"I will now turn the conference call over to your host, Ms",neg,train
"Yes, so Jonathan, remember we were showing in the upper teens back then and people were saying to us, hey, you need to consume more of that balance sheet capacity and grow more than what you’re showing, and what we always said to people back then was, we anticipate being a significant taxpayer around 2020 and that’s going to consumer some of that balance sheet and drop us from the high teens into the mid-teens",neg,train
We’re now anticipating bottoming out in the 14% FFO to debt range before we start climbing again,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Electric Power Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings conference call",neg,train
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question and answer session",neg,train
"If you should require assistance during today’s call, please press star followed by zero",neg,train
"So just on tax reform, wanted to dig into one other topic on it",neg,train
"Looking at your EEI slides and the drop relative to that in your cash flow from operations for ’18 and ’19 is about $700 million to $800 million, wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving that drop? Is it one of the bonus depreciation to makers, is it the revenue requirement coming down? Just wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving it, and if there are any that can move as a result of all the negotiations that you’re talking about right now",neg,train
"So starting with our financial performance for the fourth quarter, we came in with GAAP earnings at $0",neg,train
"76 per share in 2016, and operating earnings at $0",neg,train
This brought the 2017 year-to-date total GAAP earnings to $3,neg,train
"24 per share in 2016, and 2017 year-to-date total operating earnings to $3",neg,train
"68 per share for 2017 landed at the top end of our revised guidance, so we ended in very good fashion leading into 2018, and looking at AEP’s total shareholder return, we have consistently over the last one, three and five-year periods provided comparable returns to the S&P 500 and consistently outperformed by a wide margin the S&P 500 electric utilities index, the very definition of a premium regulated utility company",neg,test
"Yes, I think the schedules are still moving towards April",neg,train
"We had a two-week delay in Texas for the tax reform implications, but the other jurisdictions are pretty well--have pretty well stayed intact, so we’re still looking at the same time frame and really we need to make that we get those kinds of responses so that we can make decisions about the other commitments relative to the project",neg,train
"I think we had given detail around that going out even a year farther than that, but we don’t anticipate any change to that in even years beyond that, so we see a runway for that out as far as we can see in our forecasts",neg,train
"First regarding Wind Catcher, I’m very pleased with the cases our teams are putting forward in all the jurisdictions",neg,test
"Sure, investors in opposition do what interveners do, but overall our regulatory teams have demonstrated the benefits of the project",neg,train
The schedules in the various jurisdictions continue to be largely on path to complete in a timely basis for approvals,neg,train
"Wind Catcher is a very unique opportunity, and our willingness to take on risk associated with this project while also providing all the benefits to the customers is a testament that we really are trying to do something good for customers",neg,train
This segment realized lower earnings due to the sale of assets,neg,train
"Partially offsetting this impact were lower depreciation on the remaining assets, positive impacts from solar projects going into service, higher trading revenues, lower taxes, and lower overall costs",neg,test
"07 per share from last year due to investment gains, lower O&M, and taxes",neg,train
"You brought up the issues of what the responses could be - obviously we could pull capital out of Oklahoma, we could look at strategic options for Oklahoma, but that’s really--let’s don’t get there yet, because we’re going to let the commission speak on this",neg,train
"I really believe that the commission will be responsive, so let’s just wait and see what that order looks like",neg,train
"No, no, but you have more debt, obviously, in the forecast",neg,train
So why are you sort of reverting to a very low expected demand growth forecast in 2018? Is that out of a function of conservatism or are you fairly confident you’re seeing things in the Q4 data that were not permanent?,neg,train
"You know, it’s an earnings growth rate, Christopher, so say it’s off 365",neg,test
"As we go forward, we don’t see that changing as ’16 came in more or less than what we had forecast",neg,train
"Looking ahead to 2018, we are reiterating our operating earnings guidance of $3",neg,train
We are also confident that there is significant runway in our capital programs to reaffirm our 5 to 7% operating earnings growth rate,neg,train
"We will finalize our pending rate cases, obtain clarity on the Wind Catcher project, and continue working with regulators to provide the best solution around the customer benefits of tax reform",neg,train
Now let’s take a look at Slide 9 to review weather-normalized load,neg,train
"Starting with the lower right chart, our normalized retail sales increased by 1",neg,test
6% this quarter and ended the year up three-tenths of a percent,neg,train
"It has taken some time, but we finally saw the growth in residential sales we expected following the steady expansion of industrial sales that started last spring, particularly in the west",neg,train
"5% return for the year, and in 2017 we increased the quarterly dividend by 5",neg,test
"1%, so even with the headwinds of weather and the need for rate case recovery, AEP provided a very respectable year to our investors while providing quality service to our customers",neg,train
"It wouldn’t make any sense for the regulatory commissions to ask for all the cash back immediately, because that would impact the credit metrics of each individual entity, and historically it hasn’t been dealt with that way",neg,train
"Back in the 80s when this occurred, it was amortized over time and we would fully expect the same thing this time around",neg,train
"SWEPCO, ROE at SWEPCO at the end of the fourth quarter was 6",neg,test
"4%, at the end of the third quarter it was 5",neg,test
"Just keep in mind, we still have that 88 megawatts of Turk hanging out there that will continue to be a slight drag to the ROE overall of SWEPCO",neg,train
"When we talk about 5 to 7% growth rate, we’re basing that off an increase in net plant and then getting that reflected in rates, and even at EEI we talked about there being somewhat of a lag associated with the investment we’ve put into place and then having that reflected in rates",neg,train
That’s least in our transmission business because of the formula-based annual true-ups that they have in the rate base,neg,test
"But really, that 5 to 7% growth rate is based on our continuing to put investment in the ground for the benefit of our customers than getting that reflected in rates, and that has--what we’ve been able to do even with what’s happened with bonus depreciation, with the reduction in the ADIT and the reduction in cash flows, we’ve still been able to keep that investment essentially unchanged",neg,train
"Yes, what we’d previously shown you at EEI was a CAGR for that over the 18 to 20 period of about 8%",neg,train
"Next, let’s review the status of our regional economies on Slide 10",neg,train
"As shown in the upper left chart, GDP growth in AEP service territory exceeded the U",neg,train
by nearly seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter,neg,train
Higher energy prices and the strong global economy in 2017 were the primary drivers for this improvement,neg,train
4% with the growth in our eastern territory following close behind at 3,neg,train
The bottom left chart shows the gap in employment growth is closing between AEP and the U,neg,test
"Once again, the strongest job growth occurred in our western territory at 1",neg,train
"3%, which was only a tenth of a percent behind the U",neg,train
Employment growth in our eastern territory closely followed at 1,neg,train
"Oh yes, and you know, that’s really where the framework originated and the rebuttal testimony",neg,train
"As far as confidence level is concerned, I’m still very happy with the way this project looks, and even with tax reform, because a lot of times it gets hung up with what we call our ultra-low gas case, and it’s not really even a gas case",neg,train
It was really made up - we took our low gas case and we stress-tested the project at 50% of whatever those gas costs,neg,train
"It’s far less than NYMEX is now, and so that’s why I say a lot of the arguments are on the fringes, talking about things that really haven’t happened",neg,train
"So if we can just get the dialog to where it’s a reasonable type of discussion, then we’ll be in good shape",neg,train
I’m with you on that - let’s don’t prejudge it,neg,train
But I would say that we’re certainly expecting all the states to give approval to it,neg,train
"The benefit of this project is its size, its proximity, where it’s located in western Oklahoma with high capacity factor wind, and with the transmission sized accordingly to serve that capacity, I think you’re getting maximum benefit in terms of the value proposition to customers",neg,train
"I’d have to say--you know, we’re just going to have look and see what outcomes",neg,train
"That’s really probably all we need to say at this point, because we want to make this project moves ahead",neg,train
"Last question, Brian, just a clarification, so the 5 to 7% growth rate, you are still basing that off an implied 365 number for ’17, and I heard you say it will go beyond 2020 as well",neg,train
"But again, should we assume that’s kind of an annual growth, or we should again assume it’s cumulative and could move around within years?",neg,train
"My last question and then I’ll cede the floor, it looks to me that the ALJ position in Oklahoma, which looks incredibly confiscatory to me as well, is as much as an $0",neg,train
09 swing in the expected earnings versus what you asked for in the case,neg,train
"It will move around within years, but the growth rate is 5 to 7%",neg,test
"Finally in the upper right chart, commercial sales for the quarter decreased by 1",neg,train
"2%, bringing the year-to-date normalized contraction to eight-tenths of a percent",neg,test
"Commercial sales declined at every operating company in 2017 except AEP Texas, with the most pronounced drop in Appalachian and Kentucky Power",neg,train
"Despite this, we still expect a modest improvement in 2018 as the economic recovery works its way through the business cycle",neg,train
"In contrast to that story, let’s talk about what tax reform and the elimination of bonus depreciation means to AEP - lower taxes, lower cash metrics, but also reduced ADIT balances, so if we largely maintain our capital spending program for the benefit of customers in the face of lower cash metrics, then we can maintain our previously forecasted growth rates",neg,train
We plan to maintain our capital spending forecast of approximately $6 billion in 2018 and $6,neg,train
"Our credit metrics will move from the high end of the Baa1 range to the lower end, but we do not anticipate raising incremental equity due to tax reform",neg,train
"We still anticipate raising $100 million through equity programs in each year 2018 through 2020, and an additional $400 million in 2020",neg,train
"This represents no change in equity needs from what we discussed with you at EEI in November, and we are reaffirming our 5 to 7% growth rate",neg,train
"Finally, as was the case at EEI in November, this plan does not include Wind Catcher",neg,train
"You know, I testified in a case in Oklahoma in the 90s",neg,train
"There was a rail spur in the northeastern, and the commission--the Oklahoma commission approved that and we got capital recovery on the project, but it benefited in terms of fuel costs",neg,train
"Matter of fact, we’ve got more customer protection mechanisms in a rebuttal than we ever had anything like that, so when you look at what’s going on in this case, we have stepped up to provide answers to the concerns that the interveners have had, and again caveated by--they certainly recommended rejection, but at the same time they said, okay, let’s work on these customer protection mechanisms, and that’s what we’ve done",neg,train
"Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"I think you have to look at the overall message of AEP has been consistent for years now, but it continues to even be augmented beyond that",neg,train
"This is a very, very solid, financially sound utility that is doing smart things for our customers and working with our jurisdictions, but it’s obviously accentuated by the largest transmission system in the country and the fact that we are making our own version of an adjustment in the fleet itself, and that’s why you have the Wind Catcher and you have other wind power projects, you’re having other transitions occur from a resource standpoint",neg,train
"I’ll take us through the fourth quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide some insight on load and the economy, review our balance sheet and liquidity, discuss tax reform, and finish with a review of our outlook for 2018",neg,train
"We dealt with major storm events with Hurricane Harvey, which was a direct hit to our AEP Texas territory, as well as provided support in Florida as a result of Hurricane Irma",neg,train
We currently have AEP employees in devastated Puerto Rico helping with the recovery and rebuilding efforts there as well and certainly wish them a safe return,neg,train
Next we’ll go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, higher ERCOT transmission revenue, the prior year Ohio global settlement, and lower O&M",neg,train
"These were offset by several items, including lower normalized load, the reversal of a regulatory provision in 2016, and higher depreciation and taxes",neg,train
The growth in earnings over last year largely reflected our return on incremental investment,neg,train
The growth in earnings also reflected the implementation of the FERC 205 forecasted transmission rates as well as the normal historical expense true-up,neg,train
"Finally, we experienced a slight decline in our joint venture earnings due to an ETT settlement in 2017",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 8, our annual operating earnings for 2017 were $3",neg,train
"This difference can be primarily attributed to unfavorable weather, the sale of the competitive generation assets, and positive items that occurred last year that were not repeated this year",neg,train
"Offsetting these were lower O&M, higher transmission earnings, and recovery of incremental investment to serve our customers",neg,train
"For 2018, we are maintaining our guidance range for the year of $3",neg,train
95 per share and reaffirming our growth rate of 5 to 7% operating earnings,neg,train
"We will be investing $6 billion in capital substantially in the regulated entities, with the vast majority of that being wires related to provide reliability and quality of service to our customers",neg,train
Obviously the rate case outcomes in the various jurisdictions that I will discuss later will be a key component of these allocation decisions,neg,train
"First, I was modestly distracted when you mentioned that you’re making a reduction in expenses due to change in benefit costs",neg,train
"And is the assumption that Wind Catcher would displace other things, or is it partially incremental? Can you remind us how we should think about that?",neg,train
Let’s try to wrap this up on Slide 13 so we can get to your questions,neg,train
"For seven years now, we have maintained O&M discipline and kept spending in a tight range of between $2",neg,train
"Last year, AEP’s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 5",neg,train
"What will be left behind will be a very small portion which will be allocable to the parent, which doesn’t have EBITDA associated with it, and that’s the small portion that we think will not be deductible",neg,train
"As we have explained previously, we have the best customer satisfaction, the best service quality and the lowest rates",neg,train
We just need to be able to attract a fair return on our investments in Oklahoma,neg,train
"After our previous disappointing rate case and a disappointing ALJ recommendation on our current case, we are hopeful that the Oklahoma commission will arrest this negative trend",neg,train
"5% but actually only recovering a 6% ROE, and if the ALJ recommendation has approved in its presence form only a 5% ROE, these results would be unattractive given AEP’s other investment opportunities",neg,train
"Now that PSO is on negative credit outlook by Moody’s, a positive result is even more important",neg,train
"You had talked about making a decision by maybe March-April, I think",neg,train
"With that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for your questions",neg,test
"Then you said parent interest expense would be mostly tax deductible, which means it’s not completely tax deductible",neg,train
"In 2020 at least, could we consider 5 to 7% to be an annual growth rate as opposed to a CAGR off of a previous base?",neg,train
The final chart to the right shows the net jobs created in AEP service territory in 2017 by sector,neg,train
"In total, there were approximately 87,000 more people working in AEP’s footprint at the end of 2017 than at the start of the year",neg,train
"Over 60% of the new jobs added in 2017 came from three categories: education and health services, professional business services, and manufacturing",neg,train
These categories typically represent higher wage jobs which should support residential sales growth in 2018,neg,train
"The exception was the retail sector, which lost nearly 5,500 jobs in 2017",neg,train
"As you know, more people are choosing to shop online as opposed to traditional big box stores",neg,test
"Despite this outlier, we are encouraged by the momentum of economic trends in our service territory and still expect modest growth in 2018",neg,train
I was answering the question in regards to tax reform,neg,train
Wind Catcher is a big change and that would clearly require us to come back out to you and explain how we’re going to finance that,neg,train
"4% at the end of the fourth quarter 2017, which is unchanged from third quarter",neg,train
"Again, you probably know we have Indiana case and our Michigan case, both rate cases filed in those jurisdictions, and would expect an outcome of those in the next couple of quarters",neg,test
"So clearly that portion about how we allocate the excess deferred income tax back to our customers is something that’s in play, and since it’s in play across 11 jurisdictions, all of which may have different interests, that’s something that we will firm up over time",neg,test
We don’t anticipate there to be a strategic change in our numbers that would have our capital and financing plans change materially,neg,test

"Finally just in terms of load growth, again in the EEI deck you had load growth of, I think for 2018, 0",neg,train
"I know you touched on this earlier as well with, I think, Greg’s question, but just wanted to get any more color on what led to the drop in ’18, anything we should be focused on, and is that ’18 number more of a steady state, do you think?",neg,train
Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call,neg,train
There are many factors that may cause these results to differ materially from these statements,neg,train
Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors,neg,train
Please refer to the reconciliation of the applicable GAAP measures provided in the appendix of today’s presentation,neg,train
"Then there is a lot of jurisdictions here to deal with as it relates to tax reform, and a couple of previous questions have touched on this already, but we have you guys reiterating the 5 to 7% long term rate, we also have a $700 million to $800 million decrease in your forecasted operating cash flow versus EEI, as would be expected here",neg,train
Is it fair to characterize your assumptions as they relate to tax reform as conservative as they pertain both to the DTL revaluation as well as just the refund considerations to customers themselves?,neg,train
"Going back to a little bit more detail on the prior conversation around the impact of tax reform and flowing that back into the state, regulatory commission processes, can you give us a little bit of a sense on how you’re thinking about that across the various states? I mean, there’s a number of ways that you could presumably approach this in terms of both addressing perhaps unrecovered items, accelerating investment, returning benefits to customers, etc",neg,train
Maybe a little bit of a flavor as you think about the various states,neg,train
"Absolutely, we just wanted to get behind what’s in those numbers",neg,train
"As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have",neg,train
"The thing is these cases, and you probably read the transcripts like I do - I get irritated with the transcripts half the time because it’s really arguments on the fringes, and a lot more discussion needs to be had about the benefits of the project and the benefits of a hedge and that kind of thing, but you argue on the fringes and a lot of it is risk adjustments associated with the project that allow for customer protections to be in place relative to the project benefits",neg,train
We’re certainly encouraging that all interveners propose what they want to get approved,neg,train
Our first question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore,neg,train
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference,neg,train
So now I’ll move to the equalizer graph and explain some of the cases that we have ongoing,neg,train
"First of all, overall we’ve continued to have a 9",neg,test
"5% ROE, and over the 12-month period we have had some delays during the year that moved into ’18, and certainly weather has impacted ’17 as well overall",neg,train
You’ll hear that in many of the cases going across the equalizer graph,neg,test
"So for AEP Ohio, the ROE for AEP Ohio at the end of fourth quarter 2017 was 14",neg,train
"2%, but you have to keep in mind that that 14",neg,train
"2% includes the legacy issues that were resolved from the global settlements that had been done earlier, so really when you look at the seed-adjusted ROE, we’re right around 10% in AEP Ohio, so we’re in a good place there",neg,train
Next we’ll go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research,neg,train
"Okay, but Oklahoma is one of the states where you might have discussions, as you say?",neg,train
Can you quantify for us at this time a range of dollars in terms of debt that you think will not qualify?,neg,test
Next we’ll go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup,neg,train
"Well again, we did not assume right away, we certainly don’t assume day one flow-backs, and we don’t think that would be a reasonable answer for jurisdictions to ask from us",neg,test
"We’ve built these ADIT balances up over the last 10 or so years, and a flow-back period that is in that time range, we think would be reasonable, or a flow-back that would be associated with the life of an asset would be reasonable",neg,train
"As far as PSO is concerned, we’ve already talked about that pretty extensively at this point",neg,train
"1% at the end of the third quarter, and of course we’re looking for the Oklahoma commission to adjust the recommendations of the ALJ at this point and hopefully have a good outcome associated with that rate case, which we expect an order very soon",neg,train
That’s something we take very seriously because we want to make investment in Oklahoma,neg,train
"When you look at the performance of PSO in relation to its customers and the rate making and everything, it doesn’t deserve the ROE recommendation and it doesn’t deserve the outcomes that we’re getting in Oklahoma",neg,train
So we have to look at that and see what the broad view is,neg,train

) So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www,neg,train
"Kentucky Power, we obviously--that was a work in progress last year",neg,train
It should move up even more now given that we have an outcome of a rate case,neg,train
"4 million increase, and it was--the settlement was actually adjusted there for certainly the impacts of tax reform",neg,train
"Long-term solution for Kentucky Power, though, will again--the rates was only a part of it",neg,train
"Let’s begin on Slide 7, which shows that operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $0",neg,train
"All of our regulated segments experienced growth for the quarter compared to last year, and as expected our competitive generation and marketing business was down due to last year’s asset sales",neg,train
"All the detail by segment is shown in the boxes on the chart, but overall the growth in our regulated business was driven by lower O&M, return on incremental investment, and positive weather impacts all partially offset by a higher effective tax rate",neg,train
The impact of the sale of the competitive assets was partially offset by lower operating expenses on the remaining assets and higher trading revenues,neg,test
05 per share from last year primarily due to lower O&M and favorable tax adjustments,neg,test
"As far as APCo is concerned, the ROE for APCo at the end of the fourth quarter was 8",neg,test
"4% at the end of the third quarter, so they are making progress; but again, it reflects weather for the entire year",neg,train
"The other thing I just want to reiterate too is that through all this, if there is any question of the 5 to 7% growth rate being in jeopardy in some fashion, that’s just not the case",neg,train
"We’re looking at the 5 to 7% growth rate just like we looked at it before, and luckily--well, not just luckily, but certainly we’re in the enviable position to be able to adjust to tax reform and still confidently talk about our 5 to 7% growth rate",neg,train
"We do assume that we are going to the lower tax rate from the 35% down to 21%, and that that will be a fairly direct pass-through to our customers in terms of rate since that 35% was baked into our rates and now 21% will be, so we view that as not being an earnings issue",neg,train
Similarly with the excess ADIT issue - it’s a matter of how do we flow that cash back to our customers and over what period of time,neg,test
"In 1986, it ranged from two years, I think, to 20 years depending on jurisdiction, and I think we’ll have an equally large spread of jurisdictions depending on each jurisdiction’s particular interest, so both of those we have reflected in our numbers, but both of those tend not to be earnings issues, they tend to be, as you were pointing out, cash issues",neg,train
"So as we look at AEP Texas, AEP Texas at the end of fourth quarter 2017 was 10%, and it was 10",neg,train
"3% last quarter, and AEP Texas decreased due to a tax refund that dropped out of the calculation that was taking place in there",neg,train
"Of course, AEP Transmission, the ROE for AEP Transmission holdco at the end of fourth quarter was 12",neg,train
"Yes, so our numbers for ’18 essentially stayed the same",neg,train
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for AEP’s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call,neg,train
"I know many of you are happy to get 2017 in the rear view mirror and move onto 2018, but I would say that we ended 2017 very strong",neg,train
"I mentioned in the third quarter earnings call for those who watch Game of Thrones, Khaleesi’s dragons didn’t show up for the heat of the summer but we definitely spent the beginning of winter at the North Wall of the White Walkers - it was really cold",neg,train
"As a matter of fact, one of my family members had the great idea that I could barbecue chicken wings on New Year’s Day for the football games, so I was outside in 10 degree weather grilling wings",neg,test
"But all in all, though I was cold outside as a shareholder, I was warm inside as we sold a lot of comfort to our customers during this cold spell",neg,train
"It’s still cold here, but we know that’s good for demand, so I’ll take it",neg,train
"Yes, it’s an all-of-the-above type of thing, because state jurisdictions are going to look at it differently based upon their own individual situations",neg,train
"We also have areas where we can accelerate depreciation or adjust plant balances or those types of things, so I think it’s particularly important for us to be mindful of where each individual jurisdiction, where the touch points are, and be able to address that",neg,train
"Transmission will be a bit of that, environmental will be a piece of that",neg,train
"Everything else, the numbers kind of work out the way they work out",neg,train
"Yes, so we assume that flows through to customers pretty directly",neg,train
"So for fourth quarter ’17, it was an outstanding quarter, and the year’s results exemplify the resiliency and the commitment of AEP’s employees to deliver consistent earnings and dividend quality, regardless of the headwinds that may exist",neg,test
"We’re very proud of 2017, and as we move into 2018, the year of tax reform, Wind Catcher, rate cases, and also forging ahead with Smart Cities, Ohio’s PowerForward project, and other forward-thinking initiatives, this will set the tone for the years to come",neg,train
"There is obviously--you know, as we go through discussions with the interveners, it’s important for us to be able to have those discussions wherever we can, and certainly we’re having those discussions certainly with Oklahoma and in Texas",neg,train
"Moving to the upper left chart, normalized residential sales were up two-tenths of a percent for the quarter and down 1",neg,train
8% in our western footprint where customer counts increased by seven-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"In the east, however, residential sales declined by nine-tenths of a percent despite the three-tenths of a percent increase in customer counts",neg,train
"Got it, so from a rating agency perspective, the drop--given you had accretion, I guess, going in, in terms of your FFO to debt, there is not a requirement to do anything at the back end given your metrics are improving by the back end, and you already had cushion, is that the way to think about the FFO to debt going forward?",neg,train
"Okay, I didn’t necessarily mean just with the deferred tax liability going back on that, just the lower tax rate itself",neg,train
Good morning everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2017 earnings call for American Electric Power,neg,train
Thank you for taking the time to join us today,neg,train
"Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep",neg,train
"Praful, we were starting in a position of strength relative to our credit metrics against our ratings, and the reason we were in that position of strength was we anticipated being taxpayers in 2020 and we described that to rating agencies and investors",neg,train
"People understood that those metrics were going to deteriorate over time, but still stay within the metrics that are appropriate for our current ratings",neg,train
Next we’ll go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"Presumably as we’re sort of thinking about the earnings implications, the main offset is the higher financing costs on more debt with the lower FFO, increasing your financing needs albeit without equity",neg,train
6% for the quarter and ended the year up 2,neg,train
"In fact, our five largest industrial sectors experienced nearly 11% growth this quarter, led by chemicals and primary metals",neg,train
"Second, in the fourth quarter two large co-generators on our system took their units offline for routine maintenance and purchased their needs from us",neg,train
"Our project is unique in that it does originate in western Oklahoma high capacity wind, but we also terminate it at where the load is in our territory, and that’s toward Tulsa",neg,train
"I think the other projects have different routings and different assumptions associated with them and congestion associated with them, different assumptions entirely",neg,train
"The pie is big enough for more than our particular transaction, so more power to them, but more power to us as well",neg,train
"I’ll just add onto that, I think it’s probably a testament to the sound financial condition of what Brian and the team has been doing for this organization, to be able to absorb the tax reform implications without issuing additional equity",neg,train
Now let’s move to Slide 11 and review the company’s capitalization and liquidity,neg,train
Our debt to total capital ratio increased nine-tenths of a percent during the quarter to 55,neg,test
Our FFO to debt ratio was solidly in the Baa1 range at 18,neg,train
Our qualified pension funding improved approximately one percentage point to 101%,neg,train
"Despite a lower discount rate, gains from plan assets outpaced an increase in the plan liability due to strong market returns",neg,train
"So to that, I was going to--I mean, you’re now talking about mid-teens as your FFO to debt target",neg,train
I think one of the slides from EEI was sort of mid to high teens,neg,train
Can you give us sort of hundreds of basis points net effect of what you think is going to happen to that metric?,neg,train
"I guess just stepping back at a high level and thinking about your growth drivers, I do see a couple positives",neg,test
"So I guess I see a few positives - you know, Oklahoma is an unknown and certainly potentially concerning, but I respect your perspective on that",neg,train
At a very big picture drivers--I guess there is often confusion between cash and GAAP and real earnings power here,neg,train
I just want to make sure I’m thinking about high level drivers correctly,neg,train
"Okay, and just on that front, to hit the 5 to 7% growth rate because cash will eventually impact earnings at some point, you don’t need to hit any certain targets in certain jurisdictions to delay that refund or get some kind of reg asset taken off your balance sheet or anything? You feel that you can reach that level with the refunds happening essentially right away?",neg,test
"At this point, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker",neg,train
And we would take our next question from Jamie Baker with J,neg,train
In fact we closed out the year with every entity with positive unit revenue growth for the entire year,neg,train
We had another quarter of strong performance in the corporate segment and forward outlook remains positive as our sales investments and initiatives continue to take hold,neg,train
Corporate revenue continued to improve quarter over quarter ending the fourth quarter 2017 with the highest year-over-year growth of the last eight quarters,neg,train
On a full year basis our GAAP net profit for 2017 was $1,neg,train
90 per diluted share compared to our 2016 GAAP net profit of $2,neg,train
Excluding net special items we reported a net profit of $455 million in the fourth quarter 2017 versus our fourth quarter 2016 net profit excluding special items of $475 million,neg,train
Our diluted earnings per share excluding net special items were $0,neg,train
92 per diluted share that we had in the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"Yes, Doug thanks from me as well for the wonderful response earlier here, it's very helpful to investors",neg,train
Hopefully you’re impressed by that answer because I know I was,neg,train
And we will take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays,neg,train
Improved execution of low-cost carrier price matching together with strong premium cabin performance due to our premium cabin initiatives were the primary drivers and the UK led the way with double digit growth,neg,test
But it does add complexity to our fleet by a new aircraft type,neg,train
"So it's not about the aircraft, it's about the complexity that it brings to our operating group for having more aircraft",neg,train
One is from an aircraft standpoint we did announce that we were bringing in ten more E175 aircraft to replace an outsourced contract that we had and take out some CRJ200s,neg,train
From a non-aircraft CapEx side as Maya said there's just so much demand going on out there,neg,train
"I just want to - what the, you know obviously you've ruled out basically I mean this last year, what the plans for 2018 will be for that, did you see that changing in terms of giving customers more options to buy some of the things that have been subtracted out of that product? And then also do you see it expanding to other markets beyond domestic and then that near Caribbean stuff you guys did a little bit ago?",neg,train
"We attracted nearly 24,000 new small-to-medium sized corporate accounts through revitalized sales efforts and investments and saw improvements in our revenue share premium to fair share in the business agency channel of 2",neg,test
6 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $5,neg,train
The company also had a restricted cash position of $318 million,neg,train
"In addition, we successfully repriced two term loans bringing our entire term loan performance portfolio to an industry-leading rate of 200 basis points over LIBOR",neg,train
All of these transactions helped contribute to the long-term financial strength of American,neg,train
"I spoke for five minutes and you gave me seven but I didn’t say, so make your own conclusions from what I told you about Americans growth, but you know, look we're not here to talk about what other people are doing their networks",neg,train
"That’s for them to decide and again we know who we are, we know the assets we have",neg,train
We feel good about our growth and look all I'm pointing out is you can look at our 2,neg,train
"5%, 3% growth and so guess why do you guess it makes sense and I just gave you the answer",neg,train
"American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  8:30 AM ET",neg,train
"Turning to revenue, the demand environment continues to be strong",neg,train
"6%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth and the sixth consecutive quarter where we outpaced the industry average growth rate",neg,train
Improvement was broad-based with every entity in a positive territory for the quarter,neg,train
"Hey Derek, can we go back to your comment about the A350s? And you said you're working with Airbus and Boeing on another option from a widebody perspective and where to go on that",neg,train
"Can you talk a little bit more in detail on what you're looking at, what you're considering?",neg,train
So I think this can change out in the farther years in 2020,neg,train
I think the fleet plan over the time period should stay pretty flat,neg,train
"Yes, I’ll try not to take the bait, but I'll try – let me try and help",neg,train
But look you know we're not going to pine on other airlines capacity plans,neg,train
That's for them to decide what to do to and to describe to you their plans,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News,neg,train
And what we have found is that there's been this explosion in new technologies that allow us to basically take some shortcuts and get things done more quickly than we were previously able to do,neg,train
The plan is to take the Embraer 190 fleet and the MD-80 fleet out by the end of '19 and that's firm in the plan,neg,train
"We are working from a widebody perspective as we talked about on the call as before, you see the A350s coming in in 2020, you know we've had conversations about that",neg,train
Those would replace - they are currently set to replace aA330-300s and other widebodys as they come in,neg,train
We're working with Airbus and Boeing on other options from a widebody perspective just to see where we go with that,neg,train
But I would assume that this fleet stays pretty flat over the next to two to three years,neg,train
Total GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $9,neg,train
This increase was driven by higher consolidated fuel expense which was up 23,neg,train
"5%, higher salaries and benefits expenses as a result of the mid-contract base pay increase given to our pilots and flight attendants in April 2017, and higher revenue related expenses and depreciation",neg,train
1% year-over-year and our consolidated CASM ex-fuel and special items was 11,neg,train
8% year-over-year due primarily to the expense increases I just mentioned,neg,train
Correct it would have been a credit to salaries and then wages,neg,train
"Okay, I appreciate the perspective and then second question really is for Robert",neg,train
"And then just a quick followup, does this include buybacks or no? I would guess it does right?",neg,train
"I just have two questions, one can you say I know you don’t report traffic, but I'm wondering if you can say what your loads are looking like and maybe you're bookings",neg,train
How they're coming along for the rest of the quarter or as far along as you're willing to comment?,neg,test

"Kind of an off, unusual question I think and maybe it's for Derek or I'm not sure who should answer this",neg,train
"If we think about the return on invested capital of the underlying airline, it's improved significantly, and while cargo has improved, you know, you mentioned that how well cargo was doing on a year-over-year basis, I wanted to get an understanding of how cargo return on invested capital fully allocated compares to that of the airline because it might – sense is historically is that it hasn't had you know it may be was contributing when the airline was weaker, but it may be not be meeting that standard now, so I wanted to understand how you think about cargoes return relative to the airline? Thanks",neg,test
How was it that you determined the appropriate pricing levels then forward if it's seen as like basically free belly space?,neg,train
"Okay, it's Don, so let me just start with the buy up",neg,train
"So we've had basic economy in the market now, but broadly domestically since September",neg,test
"We rolled it out to the Caribbean, the subset of Caribbean and Mexico markets in late November",neg,train
"The product is working entirely as we expected and so we're seeing the buy up rates that we expected to see and we're seeing the sell up amounts that we expected to see, so basic economy is really at this point working as designed",neg,train

"The reason I believe that is, because kind of fuel prices have run up so quickly",neg,train
"And if you look, you know, as Derek stated I mean you're right, your numbers are right of course if you take them, I guess at the midpoint of our range kind of year-over-year earnings are pretty flat in our forecast",neg,train
For the sixth consecutive quarter our fourth quarter revenue performance led the industry,neg,train
7% to $232 million in the fourth quarter due in part to a 12,neg,train
1% year-over-year primarily driven by higher bank fees and frequent flyer revenue,neg,train
My question is just how are you at American addressing these concerns to shareholders and just what's the general view on capacity growth and how it's affecting the market,neg,train
Like this 2017 was a great year for American Airlines from a financial perspective as we announced this morning,neg,train
"In terms of accomplishments, the teams did a phenomenal job through sometimes difficult circumstances",neg,test
"Yes, on the revenue side we have a lot of fantastic opportunities that we're working with Don Casey's group on",neg,train
On the cost side we have opportunities to really streamline our processes and the product that we provide,neg,test
And a lot of it is really just better customer experience and we're very focused on providing things to our customers that really make the whole experience with American better,neg,train
"In addition to our earnings release, we also filed our investor update this morning",neg,test
As discussed at our Investor Day in September we will now provide guidance on a consolidated basis and longer-term CASM CapEx and fleet guidance,neg,train
"We also disclosed in our updated that due to the adoption of new accounting standards on January 1, 2018 relating to revenue recognition as well as the income statement classification of certain pension and benefit costs, we would provide recast numbers for 2017 reflecting those changes",neg,train
"We've reduced schedule churn, implemented airport service management tools at key hubs, brought innovated automation tools online and enhanced our maintenance processes",neg,train
All of these changes are evident in our operating stats as our performance was significantly better in 2017 versus 2016,neg,train
"And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr",neg,train
"More on the cost side, more on the revenue side, if you could just help us understand?",neg,test
We entered 2018 with great momentum and we are bullish about our future,neg,train
We certainly don’t think there's enough return in that business for an airline like American to go invest in freighters for example,neg,train
"Before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and costs, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices",neg,train
"These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected",neg,train
"Information about some of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017",neg,train
For the remainder of the year we expect our CASM growth to trend lower,neg,train
5% and fourth quarter will be up approximately 0 to 2% versus 2017,neg,train
1% year-over-year increase in consolidated fuel expense in 2018 or about $1,neg,train
12 [ph] also in the second quarter and the third quarter $2,neg,train
Everything I just rattled off about our growth plans were in place before and remain in place now and we don't have any intention to change those based on what we know,neg,train
Our customer survey data on likelihood to recommend is the highest of American Airlines history and our year-over-year growth in revenue was industry leading,neg,train
As to making culture a competitive advantage we started the year by giving each team member two round-trip positive based tickets in appreciation of their work and allowing American Airlines to win the Air transport World’s 2017 Airline of the Year award,neg,train
"Yes, and Dan I would say for us to get the $3",neg,train
"9 billion worth of initiatives that we're talking about, this work will help us bring it in quicker and do what we need to do",neg,train
Some of that is required a lot of IT help to get us done,neg,train
We can't get there without the IT group helping us get through this and what they're doing is really helping us get through it quicker and figuring out ways to bring things in the market quicker on both the revenue and the cost side,neg,train
"And lastly, we completed the mainline livery repainting project in the fourth quarter",neg,train
So all mainline aircraft that are planned to stay in the fleet have now been painted,neg,train
We appreciate everyone's interest and thank you for tuning in,neg,test
"If you have any questions and you are an Investor, cal, Dan, if you have any questions and you are in the media call corp",neg,train
"I appreciate that commentary and then just as a follow up maybe some data thinking as well, but with regional aircraft which have the highest fuel intensity, the highest sort of gallons per passenger if you want to think about it that way, obviously a lot less 50 seaters than there used to be and you're growing with 76s which are more fuel efficient, but where do you start to see the break points on fuel for regional lift? Is it 80 bucks, is it 90 bucks, where does that become more of a focus? Thanks for taking the questions",neg,train
"My follow up will be American centric okay? So shifting this spotlight back to and thank you to indulging me, it's what people needed to hear, so forgive me for that first question",neg,train
"In 2017 we posted our best full year results in on-time departures, on-time arrivals and baggage handling since our merger closed in 2013",neg,train
"Our completion factor would have set records too, but was significantly impacted by the back-to-back-to-back hurricanes in September that impacted the Caribbean and Southeast United States",neg,train
"In November we set records in each of the core metrics and equally important, our operational performance during the peak summer and holiday periods were significantly improved versus 2016",neg,train
"How long it took for kind of capacity to respond to the new economics? And when prices go up this fast, it does, it takes a while to respond",neg,train
"So as we sit here today if oil stays where it is, I happen to believe you'll see the industry and you'll - the fares are too low for oil prices this high, and over time you'll see that adjust, but it takes time",neg,train
"part of it is that requires some capacity refinement, part of it is people have to believe it's there",neg,train
"This has gone from oil, but it's gone from what 50 to 70 in five months? 40% increase?",neg,test
And we will take our final question from Alana Wise with Reuters,neg,train
"Before I begin, I'd like to thank our team members for the great job they did in 2017 taking care of our customers",neg,train
We filed our fourth quarter and full-year earnings press release this morning,neg,train
"In that release, our fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net profit was $258 million or $0",neg,train
"54 per diluted share, down $31 million from our fourth quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $289 million",neg,train
"Yes, I mean we mean we currently have an order for 22, A350s that come in 2020",neg,train
So there is - we have the order in place,neg,train
"We still have three big integration projects that we want to complete with our HR systems, our pilots, flight attendants and tech ops",neg,train
So those are the two big differences from the Investor Day,neg,train
We've got a pretty good idea of where we're doing well and not and you know what the impact of variations of fuel expense are,neg,train
So it's something that we look at certainly every month if not more and especially as we take a look out into the longer term,neg,train
Our full year 2017 revenue performance finished well ahead of 2016 with a 3,neg,train
We continue to innovate in revenue management with our focus on the premium cabin which delivered a full 2 points to system unit revenue improvement,neg,train
"So with that said, I'll turn it over to Derek, who will give you some more detail on the financials and then we'll go to Robert who has some more color on the revenue and the operations fronts",neg,train
There is no date that we need to make that decision,neg,train
Under the new revenue standard our 2017 pretax income received a non-cash benefit of $311 million,neg,train
The reclassification of certain pension and benefit costs resulted in a net $138 million gain moving from operating to non-operating expense and has no effect on the 2017 pretax income,neg,train
The recast financial statements are included along with the investor update we filed as an 8-K this morning and should be used as a baseline for your models,neg,train
"Yes, Conor as Don said earlier, the product has been out about six months now",neg,train
"It's meeting expectations which is great, will always take a look at ways to refine and optimize",neg,train
We like what's going on right now and we're staying the course with it,neg,train
"2% year-over-year in line with performance from previous quarters, while growing capacity by 7",neg,train
"5% with the launch of Los Angeles to Beijing, again our strong premium cabin performance made the material difference",neg,train
And we will take our next question from Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News,neg,test
In regard to creating a world-class customer experience we produced record-setting operational reliability to American and we did that where we continued the most aggressive and successful aircraft modernization program in the history of commercial aviation,neg,train
We've introduced the best lounge product ever created by a U,neg,train
"carrier with flagship lounges in Miami, LAX, JFK, and improvements in Chicago",neg,train
We successfully rolled out our basic and premium economy products,neg,train
And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI,neg,train
Our capital plans for 2018 include a decline in spending from previous years due primarily to lower aircraft CapEx,neg,test
"Our fleet renewal program will continue in 2018, but at a much slower rate",neg,train
For the full year we expect gross CapEx to total $1,neg,train
This includes the delivery of 22 mainline and five regional aircraft,neg,train
"These will replace older Super 80s, Dash 8s and CRJ 200 aircraft",neg,train
"7% year-over-year on both strong volume and yields, continuing a positive trend that we've seen since the second half of 2016",neg,train
We expect our year-over-year TRASM to be up 2% to 4% in the first quarter,neg,train
This will mark the sixth quarter in a row of positive unit revenue growth,neg,train
"Consistent with 2017 we expect all four entities to have positive unit revenue growth led by Latin, followed by Atlantic, then Domestic and Pacific",neg,train
"Our pretax basis of course, after tax because the tax rate they’re up a good bit, but on a pretax basis they are pretty flat",neg,train
"8 billion our higher expense, so for us to be producing flat earnings on one of our - what's become again our largest cost going up by $1",neg,train
"Now again, you should rightfully say, well gosh, if it's a real business that like you've been saying that we'll figure out a way to pass its cost increases along to customers like why don’t you pass it on, there definitely is a lag on things like this",neg,train
"We saw it in, what year it was 2014 when prices fell really quickly?",neg,train
So in conclusion I'd like to once again congratulate our entire team for another excellent year and thank them for getting our customers where they need to go safely and on time,neg,train
"Yes that's all, Michael most of that is the pension benefit",neg,train
"The Republic, since we're 25% ownership we do have to use the equity method of accounting, but that's a small portion",neg,train
At this time I'd like to turn the call over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks,neg,train
Before I begin my remarks I'd like to echo what both Doug and Derek said and thank our entire team for taking care of our customers throughout the year,neg,train
"They worked through hot temperatures, cold temperatures, rains, snow, ice, hurricanes and even earthquakes and demonstrated to the world what teamwork at American Airlines is all about",neg,train
So from all of us I'd like to offer sincere thank you for a great year,neg,train
A reconciliation to those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website at aa,neg,train
By region we expect 2018 system capacity to be up approximately 3% both domestically and internationally,neg,test
By quarter we expect first quarter consolidated capacity to be up 666,neg,train
76 [ph] billion ASMs and the fourth quarter to be 69,neg,train
"As discussed at our Investor Day and reiterated on our third quarter 2017 earnings call, we continue to anticipate that our unit cost growth rates will trend lower throughout the year and expect 2018 full-year nonfuel CASM to increase by approximately 2% excluding the impact of any new labor",neg,train
Because once you get to a point that those are your assets it makes sense I think to strengthen them and some of us are further along in that than others,neg,train
"I don’t ask if we changed our estimate based upon what we heard we have not - it doesn't - nor have we changed, nor do we have any plans to change",neg,train
"And Duane look, I remember the old days and the old days the reason you'd cut that point was because it was cash negative and it made sense to cut it as oil prices got to a certain level it was running close to that in today's world",neg,train
So if we were to cut flying because oil prices ran up from 50 to 70 we would reduce profits and instead it turns into a $4 billion year instead of $5 billion year and over time we adjust pricing and capacity over time and adjust to where we think we're in the world fuel price starts to spell out,neg,train
"2017 also brought the highly anticipated opening of the flagship lounges in JFK, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, which have been met with enthusiastic reviews",neg,train
"Flagship lounges will be added to DFW, Philadelphia, London Heathrow in the future",neg,test
"We also opened new Admirals Club locations in Orlando, Houston, Los Angeles Terminal 5 and Toronto with refurbished clubs opening in JFK, Chicago and Los Angeles Terminal 4",neg,train
And we will take our next question from Kevin Crissey with Citi,neg,train
"Well, I'm going to ask a more nerdy analyst question about your EPS outlook, so we do appreciate the range, but to get to 650 if I just put in your guidance on cost, I'm getting to like a 7% to 8% range on revenue",neg,train
"And now my math is not perfect, but I think that's implying like a RASM north of 5% hit the top range assuming your TRASM stays where you've guided",neg,train
So can you talk to - should we be thinking the upside of EPS as more cost base or do you really think significant revenue acceleration in this market is achievable?,neg,train
During the fourth quarter the company made dividend payments of $48 million and repurchased 4,neg,train
6 billion in share repurchases and $200 million in dividends and since mid-2014 as Doug said our total is $11,neg,train
"As a result of these repurchases, our share count outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was 475",neg,train
5 million a reduction of 37% from the merger close in December 2013,neg,test
So we've got a pretty good handle on it and at the end of the day we feel really confident with the schedule that we have built right now that we're profitable at these levels and that we're flying to where we ought to be,neg,train
So I think we've got a good handle on both the short and long range plan for it,neg,train
It's part of the process that we put the team through as we built the schedule,neg,train
"On the fleet side, 2017 was the final year of our Accelerative Fleet Renewal Program where we inducted more than 400 mainline and 100 regional aircraft",neg,test
We added an average of 97 aircraft per year from 20 14 to 2017 and expect to only induct 27 aircraft in 2018,neg,train
"Once we do that, we'll go certainly create unique connections to Europe for a customer base that flies a lot already",neg,train
"So in our announcement you see new nonstop from Wellington Dallas, this just opens up customers and connections to places like Mexico, Ski markets, Hawaii, all of which are one stop markets a customer has never had",neg,train
"So of the 52 two new routes we added 47 of them fall into that category, existing cities and new hubs",neg,train
We were able to deliver both load factor and yield improvements with continually improving revenue management execution in both the trough and peak periods,neg,train
The improvements were broad-based with every hub exhibiting unit revenue growth,neg,train
Our Latin America performance was very strong with PRASM up 6,neg,train
"The rest of South America, the Caribbean and Central America, all had double-digit revenue - unit revenue growth",neg,train
A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website,neg,train
The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently,neg,test
"And Helane, as you take a look at kind of the strength of bookings, yes we're seeing just a continuation of what we saw in December and so it's relatively flat, but that was a pretty good spot to be in",neg,test
"It doesn't result in yield decline, doesn’t result in fare wars",neg,train
It does mostly I think better and we're not spending enough time to suggest that his is all stimulus and it's not,neg,train
"But it just doesn't engender the kind of response that it feels like people seem to think, we're just looking at a number because we're doing what we think makes sense given our competitive advantage",neg,train
"Okay perfect and then second question on, I really appreciate the fact that you guys are providing a fleet plan all the way out to 2020, this is great",neg,train
And it took a while for us all to think that 50 was a real number when it had fallen from 100 down to 50,neg,train
"It may take a while for people to really understand that if 70 is the real normal the new normal, you certainly will see I think us get to a point where we can produce the kind of earnings that you're talking about in $70 oil, but we've done it in $100 oil in the past",neg,train
"So any way long way we're saying it's - I'm not saying just because oil is $70 we can't make those numbers, what I'm saying is it's run up so fast it makes it hard to get there",neg,test
"If it falls back down quickly, we're absolutely right back in that range",neg,train
"Doug, if I were to para – that's very helpful exceedingly helpful",neg,train
"If I were to paraphrase that into a sound bite, do you characterize OA growth provided its hub centric and not uniquely damaging to the American Airlines franchise, yes or no?",neg,train
"So that's how we're paying ourselves on short term incentive based on our ability to - not by the way, you’re right our guidance doesn't have us there, so I'm not suggesting that our guidance has a setting, what I'm saying is it's still in the range up 3, 5, 7, and this feels like a year at least looking at it right now isn't one of the - is somewhat a below average year for our kind of steady-state [indiscernible]",neg,train
"The 777-200 retrofit program which involved updating the aircraft interiors, adding new IFE and Wi-Fi was completed in mid-2017 Premium Economy officially launched in early May on the 787-9 aircraft and customer response has been very positive",neg,train
More than half the planned widebody fleet now features this highly differentiated product and all planned aircraft will have it installed by the fourth quarter of this year,neg,train
"The 777-200 fleet, the high density 777-200 fleet and the 330-200s are fully installed and work is underway on the 777-300 fleet as well",neg,train
We continue to expect our 2018 capacity to be up approximately 2,neg,train
5% on a schedule over schedule basis which is consistent with guidance provided on our third quarter 2017 earnings call and in line with anticipated GDP growth,neg,train
The hurricanes that hit Florida and the Caribbean last September which resulted in more than 8000 flight cancellations is expected to add approximately 50 basis points of this guidance on a schedule over actual basis,neg,train
"The full year growth is driven by an increase in utilization of about two points, completion factor increase of about half a point, and engage of about a half a point",neg,train
"We're seeing commodity like products, fish and salmon out of South America and Central America coming up that's adding revenue",neg,train
We're seeing meat out of the South Pacific that are coming into the U,neg,train
In the old days we thought about red eye flying to leisure destinations as the first candidates for capacity trends,neg,train
"Of course this would put some upward pressure on your unit cost as you shrink today, but can you talk about how higher fuel impacts network planning and if it has started to lead to any cuts and if so what profile of markets that would include?",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"We've got a great cargo team led by Rick Elieson, who was appointed earlier this past year taking over from Jim Butler",neg,train
We're returning to levels of production that we really haven’t seen since 2014,neg,train
"And when you take a look at, you know, what we've actually produced over the last couple of quarters, it’s both volume and yield based, so you know all good",neg,test
"Hey Kevin, I'll start and then Robert can just give you more color if you'd like on the cargo business of it",neg,train
We invest in capital through our people and cargo and we invest in their plans and a lot more for people than for cargo,neg,train
So you need to put them together and it's impossible,neg,train
They come together when you acquire the capital and aircraft,neg,train
"And then lastly and the biggest one is connecting existing cities to new hubs and this – look this is really, this is much of the promise of the merger",neg,train
"For example, American Airlines has always done really well in Oklahoma City for obvious reasons, proximity to Dallas",neg,train
And we have a pretty strong base of customers there,neg,train
But we've never flown from Philadelphia to Oklahoma City and that's one of the routes we announced,neg,train
We did talk a little bit about this and the comment for the record is we're not going to pine on another airline,neg,train
For the full year our 2017 net income excluding special items was $2,neg,train
"On a pretax basis, GAAP fourth quarter 2017 pretax profit was $425 million",neg,train
Excluding net special items our fourth quarter pretax profit was $739 million resulted in a pretax margin of 7%,neg,train
For the full year our GAAP pretax profit of $3,neg,train
1 billion if we exclude special items the number is $3,neg,train
"In 2017 we also introduced several new customer service tools with dynamic re-accommodation, customer bag notification, Notify All and a refreshed mobile app",neg,train
We're also enhancing the customer experience in Main Cabin Extra,neg,train
The new placards will go on to the overhead bins next week and that free drink is coming in the spring,neg,train
"Okay, fine and then Robert, in the opening remarks, funny you cited effective LCC price matching is a tailwind to your transatlantic RASM, it's funny",neg,train
You get – calling price matching is the reason your RASM was good,neg,test
"Can you, if I am not misinterpreting the comment, can you just elaborate on what you meant by that and maybe feel free to talk about that entire LCC transatlantic dynamic for a second while you're at it? Thank you",neg,train
Is there a date by which you need to make that decision?,neg,train
"Okay, and then can I just ask a different cargo related question, because your volumes are up a lot and you're - obviously you reported a very strong number and you commented on Kevin's question, but I'm kind of wondering what are you carrying? Is this packages for Amazon, is it packages for the postal service which would be Amazon, do you know what's in those? I mean you must have to know what's in the bellies right? Because you have to know your customer",neg,train
"It's certainly appropriate if you want to dig my advantage account by 20,000 or 25,000 miles in light of the time totally fair",neg,test
"Two questions here, just on the guidance in the non-operating [ph] it looks like you're getting a $300 million benefit there and it does look like I guess Republics in there",neg,train
Is some of that what just been with the pension I know you've had a pension benefit that ran through the P&L is that showing up in there? What's driving that number?,neg,train
Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group Fourth Quarter 2017 earnings call,neg,train
"At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
As we look to 2018 we continue to be encouraged with the revenue environment and are excited about what that means for American,neg,train
"We're proud of what our team has accomplished so far and we look forward to the future and with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session",neg,train
"Yes, first off, Daniel and strategic advantage doesn't mean we have to be number one",neg,train
"In LAX we today are the largest, it's a definitely a fragmented market, but a very large market",neg,train
The issue is LAX's terminal space and you know my comments were directed around the fact that we have been able to work out the situation with the Airport Authority we'll be able to expand there,neg,train
Robert will talk more about our fourth quarter 2018 TRASM forecast increase of $2% to 4% but when we combine the cost guidance we just gave we expect the first quarter 2018 pretax margin excluding special items to be between 2% and 4%,neg,train
"In addition, we also are providing long-term earnings per share guidance at this point",neg,train
We expect our 2018 earnings per diluted share to be between $5,neg,train
"We're going to start the call today with Doug, and he will provide an overview of our financial results",neg,train
Derek will then walk us through the details on the fourth quarter and provide some additional information on our 2018 guidance,neg,train
"Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions and lastly questions from the media",neg,train
"To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a followup",neg,train
"Of course there's equipment and people in that and we price it to achieve, you know and we're not going to get into that today, but we price it to achieve what we consider a significant margin and you know a margin that in many cases exceeds what we would see from aspects of our passenger revenue",neg,train
"We'll, I would like to start on that, but go ahead and share, just as there is a price matching and you know the industry ended up much more comprehensively matching the Atlantic LCCs in October 2016, so we're kind of lapping the period where we started the matching and over the kind of the year we've become - as we looked at the results more affective at where we match, and how the yield management system views those fares and when we are open and closed",neg,train
"So this is really a benefit associated to better execution, right of the strategy that when the industry started to employ in October 2016",neg,train
We invested several $100 million in team member facilities throughout the system as well as equipment improvements,neg,train
We launched the first team member survey in over a decade and now we ended the year by sharing the long-term benefits of the recent tax cuts and jobs acts by issuing $1000 payments to all of our non-officer team members,neg,test
Hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question,neg,train
"And Robert, I appreciate because we've gotten more airfreight discussions here on this call that I've heard probably in ten years of [indiscernible] calls",neg,train
"So you know, Derek told you that we estimate at American that we're going to grow you know schedule to schedule only about 2",neg,train
"5% of growth in 2018 versus 2017, 3% when you include the fact that we had the Hurricanes in 2017",neg,test
"That number by itself is somewhat meaningful, but it's really important I think to understand and to try and understand what type of growth we're talking about in that 2",neg,train
5% or 3% and how it relates to our existing set of assets,neg,test
"So look, well that's an example based on today's world",neg,test
"It's indicative of the kind of things we all used to see in the old days and I think again we're still a victim of our past when people just hear growth they think, well here they go again",neg,train
"Well, first off, you should work with Derek and Dan",neg,train
I think we don't have that type of number in order to get to the top of the range,neg,train
"It was like 3% to 4%, 3 at the bottom, 4 at the top, but points still now, but we have to make sure we're all working with similar math",neg,train
"Yes, based on what - where we closed the year and what we' think, the ASM growth is going to be next year, you would need 3% to 4% RASM growth",neg,train
"And but, we wouldn't have given that as our EPS guidance and we didn't think that was reasonable revenue guidance",neg,test
"So yes, it's and again if fuel prices stay where they are we think that well within the realm of possibilities",neg,train
"Okay and so that you know under the old accounting Derek, that pension piece would have just shown up in salary and wage expense?",neg,train
"And Chicago is one more story, we're not the largest hub carrier in Chicago, but we're awfully close and another enormous market where we do well even though we're not the absolute largest and the good news is, we've just worked with the Airport Authority and five more gates there which allows us to become even stronger",neg,train
A lot of these cities have one or two departures a day,neg,train
"We take them up to three, you know, cities like Stillwater and Lake Charles get up to three departures a day instead of one or two",neg,train
It has the same sort of effect and we just make the connections,neg,train
"We create more connections for our customers, make the hubs even stronger",neg,train
"In the Atlantic the premium market, we saw very strong premier performance last year",neg,train
This was a combination of the product improvements that we've made,neg,train
"We didn't get to a fully life like product across our entire widebody fleet until June, July '17 and now we can have that product consistently in the marketplace",neg,train
And the combination of those changes have led to very strong Premium Cabin performance and in fact for the full year of 2017 revenue in the Premium Cabin was up 15%,neg,train
The high end of your 2018 EPS guide still falls around a billion short of that mid cycle $5 billion target,neg,train
"Revenue trends are looking good at the moment, labor pretty much industry wide has been remarked, but capacity is starting to creep, margins appear to have stagnated",neg,train
I don't know it just sort of fuels mid cycle to me right now,neg,test
"So I'm wondering what's holding you or holding American back from achieving that $5 billion mid cycle target or should we just assume that the 3, 5, 7, needs to be downwardly adjusted maybe by a billion for each post?",neg,train
Following the passing of the recent tax cuts and job act our book tax rate has been reduced from approximately 38% to approximately 24%,neg,train
As a result of tax reform the company recorded a special non-cash tax benefit of $7 million to reflect the impact of the lower rate on our deferred tax accounts,neg,train
"In addition, under the new law we expect to receive cash tax refunds of approximately $170 million in both 2019 and 2020 related to the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax",neg,train
This guidance includes approximately $250 million of cost reductions from our One Airline initiative which is $50 million higher than what we had outlined at our Investor Day,neg,train
"We expect our first quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items to be up approximately 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis with the increase driven in part by the rate increases given to our pilots and flight attendants last April which is not in our 2017 first quarter base, higher depreciation and amortization, increases in revenue related expenses and increases in rent and landing fees",neg,train
"We had Panama City to Dallas, we open up markets to the people of Panama City and people who want to get to Panama City that don't really exist today and certainly give them better connections than they have today",neg,train
There's not an ability to – that doesn't engender some sort of enormous competitor response so what do you do,neg,test
"So that's part of it, but it's not most of it",neg,train
"With respect to our pensions, on our last call I had estimated that our 2018 pension contribution would be approximately $780 million which will fund our pensions to 80%",neg,train
"However, in 2017 our pension assets had strong investment performance and as a result we now expect to make pension contributions of only $465 million in 2018 to reach that 80% funded level",neg,train
This amount is significantly more than the minimum required contribution of abruptly $35 million in 2018,neg,train
"In 2017 we worked hard to validate the trust placed in us by our customers, team members, and shareholders",neg,train
"Okay, I appreciate the discloser and the discussion in this call",neg,train
"So, you know if we were to tell you for example, or that 2",neg,train
"5% to 3% here is what we decided, we are one of the biggest airline in the world, so we think we should serve the largest point of one [ph] market the United States",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank,neg,test
"We continue to believe 3, 5, 7 are at range",neg,train
We continue to - and again don't take our word for it,neg,train
We just said our – we had our board meeting yesterday to set our 2018 objectives and our management teams bonus payments are based upon that in fact is our formula,neg,test
"Doug, I appreciate your leap of faith on the earnings guide, I really do, but then I probably know the answer to this, but was this the same EPS range that you expected to provide a couple of days ago, before United announced their, let's just call it ambitious capacity plan?",neg,train
"Okay, I appreciate the details there and then I do want to nitpick a little bit on CapEx because it looks like since your analyst meeting you've taken up the fin level about $0",neg,train
Can you talk to you know it was this driven by tax reform or is just incremental opportunities that you found even before the tax rates came down?,neg,train
Derek Kerr - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
The air bags as everybody knows is still a driver of volume,neg,train
So it's broad based and it's everything from technology to more food and perishables and so and then as well I would note that just general mail has been pretty strong too,neg,train
"We're doing it in three ways; new cities and first off and this is, I know you noticed some changes from all those - we announced a couple weeks ago a schedule change through the summer which defines most of where we're going to be where that expansion is",neg,train
"Thanks Alan and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call",neg,train
"In the room with us this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"Also in the room with us for our Q&A session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior Vice President of Revenue Management",neg,train
"Hey Dan, I'm going to let Maya Leibman, our CIO answer that for you",neg,train
9 billion in revenue and cost initiatives that are expected to be realized by the end of 2021,neg,train
"And again, I think one way to characterize this, we talked a lot about how we think the domestic U",neg,train
"So the guidance would not include anything related to follow-on storm activity just too hard to predict but what I - just to remind everyone, whenever there's a storm and the kind of storms that we had, the portables or the things that sell very quickly because they provide immediate power needs for people",neg,train
And so that's what we saw and you do have a little trickle-on effect doing smaller obviously that's what you saw here in the quarter a bit,neg,train
Certainly Joe we've had our number discussions with the OEMs and the retailers in terms of what the market expectations are,neg,train
The industry forecast still remain pretty consistent along the way,neg,train
What’s happened and we’ve tried to highlight this and I think they're just remains a bit of confusion about kind of capacities that are in the market on the OEM side,neg,train
"If I look going back, we're able to change a little bit over the years, but it could be north of 200 basis points of a benefit to the effective rate",neg,train
For the fiscal 2018 second quarter we reported 4% growth in quarterly earnings with accelerating strength in our commercial offerings supplemented by a modest contribution from follow-on storm related sales of generators,neg,train
"Across the board, our lines of commercial products have robust revenue growth",neg,train
"With our second quarter results, we announced upward revisions to our full year guidance increasing our sales range by $10 million, an adjusted earnings per share by $0",neg,train
Growth and sales of Vanguard commercial engines partially offset the decrease,neg,test
"1%, a decrease of approximately 50 basis points from the gross profit margin last year of 23",neg,train
The decrease was largely driven by unfavorable sales mix due to lower service parts revenue and lower production volume,neg,test
8 million units which was 5% lower than the second quarter last year,neg,train
I will begin by touching on some highlights from the financial results,neg,train
"Third, our move in to services continues to make progress with our recent introduction of Infohub for commercial cutters",neg,test
"Infohub for commercial cutters is an integrated technology solution that provides commercial cutters with a tool to be more effective at scheduling jobs, preparing bids and deploying their crews and equipment",neg,train
It is unique to the industry and that is the first fleet management solution that can integrate all equipment brands,neg,train
"The new Vanguard engines feature include starting, reduce maintenance, less noise and vibration and better service and support",neg,train
5 horsepower Vanguard 200 will be available in our fourth quarter,neg,train
We are very encouraged by this engine launch based on early feedback from our customers and will keep you updated as this and other commercial Vanguard engines in this series are launched over the next two years,neg,train
"As Todd noted earlier, we also expect to begin shipping our new commercial Vanguard horizontal engine in the fourth quarter",neg,test
"Second, our small engine inventory position was elevated at the end of the second quarter",neg,train
"As a result, we plan to have lower engine production in the third quarter compared to last year",neg,test
We continue to expect full year gross margin expansions for both the engines and products segments,neg,train
"9 million related to the implementation of tax reform, as well as business optimization and pretax cost of $3",neg,train
"Excluding these items, our second quarter adjusted net income was $10",neg,train
The engines and products segments incurred approximately $2 million and $1 million of pretax business optimization program costs respectively,neg,train
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter of $14 million was lower than capital expenditures which were higher year-over-year largely due to investments in our business optimization program,neg,train
Those are probably the two of the biggest things near-term and then on a go-forward basis the thing every company has to evaluate are couple of new provisions that you may have heard of that look at some your foreign earnings mix as well as I guess how they restate the alternative minimum tax that used to exist that can impact time over time depending on where your earnings are,neg,test
"Three questions if I could, Mark, I just what to clarify one comment you had in terms of because of the moving parts in the third quarter you mentioned that the earnings would be flat year-over-year",neg,train
You expect that the earnings will be flat year-over-year in the third quarter,neg,train
Were you referring to earnings before or after tax with that comment?,neg,train
"In addition, we’ll be on joint production of Vanguard commercial engines which will reduce delivery lead times to our largest market facilitate accelerating product development and overall enable us to fully implement our commercial strategy",neg,test
Product segment net sales for the second quarter increased by approximately 17% or $31 million,neg,train
The increase was largely driven by growth in sales of Allmand commercial jobsite products and Ferris commercial mowers,neg,train
"In addition to favorable market conditions, several new products we launched in the second half of last year have gained nice traction and continue to propel growth",neg,train
Can you help ballpark quantify the amount of the spend in dollars?,neg,train

As I noted previously we increase our sales outlook for the year due to follow-on generator sales that occurred in the second quarter,neg,train
We are observing increase market activity for standby generators in the regions impacted by hurricane in this past fall particularly in Florida which is encouraging,neg,train
"We'll keep you updated on our efforts to help owners, homeowners and small businesses gain the peace of mind that comes with having standby power",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of [Gary Seams],neg,train
We're also increasingly optimistic about the future of our new horizontal engine platform,neg,train
We continue to see strong demand for commercial mowers and as Mark noted earlier bringing our new facility online later this year will provide capacity for growth,neg,train
"As a result of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, we reported a one-time charge of $24",neg,train
9 million in the second quarter from the estimated impact of the inclusion of foreign earnings and revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities,neg,train
"Excluding this charge, as well as the costs of our business optimization program, we now expect that our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate will be in a range of 29% to 31% which is approximately 200 basis points lower than what we anticipated prior to tax reform",neg,train
And was that - is that the most significant credit that potentially goes away or are there others also that offset the significant corporate tax drawdown?,neg,train
I have a question about the six and seven Ace bonds maturing in a few years,neg,train
Could we possibly have a bond offering sooner to replace them at a savings in the coupon? Thank you,neg,train
Is that going to be ongoing best you can tell on a go-forward basis each year or is that a one-time investment and I noticed the inclusion of just homeowner-related end markets,neg,test
I thought that was interesting especially since your obviously have a very significant focus on your commercial markets? Why the focus on the promotional spend for homeowners as opposed to commercial?,neg,train
"But I'd say looking at the go-forward rate, the biggest impacts on favorable would indeed be that manufacturer deduction the change in executive comp, the fact that we mentioned on the call to our foreign earnings now we expect will blend at a rate higher than the U",neg,train
statutory and so that takes up the blended effective rate as well,neg,train
Well we took up the net sales for the follow-on storm at around $10 million compared to in the first quarter where we took up the sales close to $30 million brought to the impact of the original storms,neg,train
So it's a fairly small by the time you get to the bottom line of what incremental profit you would have from that call it somewhere around the $2 million area pretax,neg,test
"Under the program, production of our Ferris commercial mowers will be moving into a new expanded and more efficient production facility",neg,train
"Sure, happy to comment, so let me start with residential",neg,train
"Our placement has been very consistent and remember and I think as you know Joe that we have very strong market share in that residential engine business in most cases north of 50%, in some cases north of 70%",neg,train
Our next quarterly earnings conference call will be held in April,neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Joe Mondillo,neg,train
"Third, in our product segment, we will be adding production capacity of the Ferris commercial mowers in the fourth quarter",neg,train
We expect that this added capacity will enable higher year-over-year growth of commercial mower sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter,neg,train
Under our business optimization program we will begin bringing online production at our new Ferris mower plant by early spring which will supplement the current plans production,neg,train
"In fiscal 2019, we will transition all remaining manufacturing to the new plant which will help us continue to meet the demand of the fast-growing commercial mower market",neg,train
"So just to clarify, your overall engine placement is similar to a year ago both on the residential and commercial and commercial is just doing so good because the end market the mowers out there that you're selling into on the engine side is just outperforming the market?",neg,train
It is also worth noting that the new tax law changed certain deductions that are done in place prior to tax reform,neg,train
"Most notably beginning in fiscal 2019, the manufactures tax deduction which have been a large contributor and lowering our effective tax rate in the past is eliminated under the new tax law",neg,train
4 million was lower than last year segment income of $17,neg,train
9 million but in line with what we had anticipated in the second quarter,neg,test
Today's presentation and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements,neg,train
These statements are based on our current assessment of the markets in which we operate,neg,train
"Actual results could differ materially from any stated or implied projections due to changes in one or more of the factors described in the safe harbor section of yesterday earnings release, as well as our filings with the SEC",neg,train
"Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE:BGG) Q2 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
We also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call,neg,test
"Additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations to comparable U",neg,train
GAAP amounts is available in our earnings release and in our SEC filings,neg,train
This conference call will be made available on our website or by phone replay approximately 2 hours after the end of this call,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
Net debt at the end of the second fiscal quarter was approximately $285 million which was $23 million lower than last year,neg,train
Last 12 month cash provided by operating activities was $152 million and last 12 month free cash flow was approximately $54 million,neg,train
"At the same time, we are not de-focusing if you will from commercial",neg,train
We are still going very hard at that market because we see some benefits,neg,train
"We wish to isolate ourselves as best as possible from the volatility around the P&L, as well as funding",neg,train
"Now, I’ll turn it over to Mark to walk through our financial results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter including our implementation of tax reform",neg,train
"Good morning, and welcome to the Briggs & Stratton fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings conference call",neg,train
"I'm Mark Schwertfeger, Chief Financial Officer, and joining me today is Todd Teske, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer",neg,train
The decrease in margins was partially offset by favorable sales mix from higher sales of commercial offerings,neg,train
"Product segment adjusted ESG&A expenses increased by approximately $2 million this year due to higher employee compensation costs, higher commissions expense on increased sales volume, and higher costs associated ERP system upgrade, as well as investments to grow our commercial offerings",neg,train
"So regarding the revenue guidance, if you exclude sort of the generator - the benefit from generators in the first half of the year, it looks like the revenue guidance still call us for roughly the 4",neg,train
5% growth that you expected at the beginning of the year,neg,train
Can you see - do you have visibility into that yet - Mark's sort of guidance for the third quarter was calling for even we been sort of pushing out production towards the spring season closer and closer you mentioned that in the second quarter now we are pushing production out from the third quarter into the fourth quarter,neg,train
5% yet in the early months of this calendar year?,neg,train
I think what you could be getting as I don't think you would have a very significant impact on interest expense for the balance of this year,neg,train
So I'm just wondering why the EPS guidance is only going up $0,neg,train
"04 before getting that fully with the taxes and is it being offset by the - is the SG&A related to the marketing and such that you mentioned is that incremental? Is that offsetting some of the benefits of the higher revenue and lower taxes, or just could you clear that up?",neg,train
And just lastly regarding sort of the generator follow-on business from the hurricanes,neg,train
You mentioned I think on the last call or on previous calls that major storms like this tend to - in terms of follow-on revenue tend sort of play out over many quarters as people sort of educate themselves,neg,train
And I'm looking to things and maybe ahead of next year's hurricane season,neg,train
"In fact on a trailing 12 month basis, we have grown sales of our commercial offerings by over 15%",neg,train
This includes considerable strength in jobsite as our strategy to expand sales to the rental channel is proving increasingly successful,neg,train
"And regarding that sort of revenue guidance in terms of the different product offerings within residential and commercial, is there any change in sort of your view or feeling, commercial versus residential or any other different product offerings as we head into the back half of the year as compared to what you are sort of thinking at the beginning of the year?",neg,train
"Grow margins in residential, drive growth in commercial, invest and built on enabling technologies, and drive operational excellence",neg,test
We look forward to providing you updates on these initiatives throughout the remainder of the fiscal year,neg,train
"And so when you look at that, I mean holding placement is really important and that's exactly what we've done",neg,train
"So, yes it’s all very consistent with our strategy in residential it's pretty much hold share, grow margins through innovation and that's exactly what we’re doing",neg,train
Total engine inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately 2,neg,train
"3 million units which is an increase of approximately 200,000 units compared to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017",neg,train
The increase in inventory is largely driven by small engines which helps to mitigate the impact on inventory dollars,neg,test
"Finally, we completed the acquisition of the ground logic commercial spreader sprayers product line",neg,train
"The transaction brought the Briggs & Stratton premiums stand on commercial spreaders and spreader sprayers for fertilizer and pesticide, herbicide lawn applications",neg,train
The acquisition fits into our strategy to fill up the trailer of the commercial lawn and turf professional with highly regarded innovative products that are built to stand up to the toughest working demands,neg,train
"And then the last question I’ll ask and I’ll let someone else have a chance is regarding the engine placement now that we’re in the beginning of this calendar year and you are closer to the spring season, you mentioned in the press release that your engine placement is similar to last year which you mentioned last year was similar two years ago",neg,train
So it's been sort of consistent over the last couple of years,neg,train
"I'm just wondering if you have any more color to add on that and then regarding sort of engine placement commercial versus residential, has there been any sort of shifts if you look at either those businesses if you single out any of those businesses, you know adding more placement on commercial and maybe nothing as much in residential or any changes or any color you can add to sort of your engine placement statement that you put in the press release?",neg,train
"I wanted to ask about the guidance, so you increased the EPS guidance by $0",neg,train
"You also mentioned that you had some follow-on generator revenue, and I think the snow throwers was good in the second quarter and you're increasing the revenue guidance",neg,train
"Second, in the fourth quarter we intend to annuitize a portion of the pension obligation which we expect will remove approximately $100 million of pension obligation and result in a non-cash pretax charge of $40 million to $42",neg,train
"Together these de-risking actions will lower our total pension obligation, help to reduce plan funding, and expense volatility and help us minimize escalating regulatory costs",neg,train
"So does your guidance include any sort of further follow-on revenue for generators in the third quarter or the fourth quarter and if not do you think there a chance that like you've said in the past, that you know maybe over the next several quarters, we continue to see sort of follow-on benefits",neg,train
"I think that that's someone true although I would say on the commercial side there's greater placement if you will by virtue of us taking market share, which is part of our objective and goals",neg,train
Now let me turn the call back over to Todd for some closing remarks,neg,train
But it's fair to say that it's probably a benefit as you look in fiscal 2019 is that fair?,neg,train
We will be able to apply our power application expertise and use our industry leading global distribution network to accelerate growth of these high-quality products,neg,train
We are track to make further progress on these and other strategic priorities during the second half of this fiscal year,neg,test
"On tax reform, as Mark noted earlier we are still evaluating the expected full impact of the legislation on our business",neg,train
"At this point, we believe our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be 200 basis points lower than our previous estimate and will add $0",neg,test
The change in the corporate tax rate became effective for us in the middle of our fiscal year,neg,train
Accordingly our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate is comprised of a blend of the pre-and post-tax reform tax rates,neg,train
"Just a few follow-up questions, the contribution of the pension plan",neg,train
And then my last set of questions have to do with the incremental promotional investment spend that you're citing I guess just for the third quarter although I don't think that's a presumption on my behalf,neg,train
"First off, can you help quantify the dollar amount of the incremental promotional spend?",neg,test
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs,neg,train
So this spend offsets the $2 million is what you are saying?,neg,train
"That's probably the most significant single one, the tax deductions on executive compensation are also different under the new rules compared to the old and so we think that could have the potential of increasing the effective rate as well",neg,train
"When you look at standby zone, that was really what I was trying to get out with regards to - in the prepared comments",neg,train
"Standby does have a longer tail on it and so we have seen increased activity in - at first we saw not increased activity in the non-storm areas because obviously when you have the storm, there is a recovery that goes on in and we're seeing obviously places as I said Florida, now we are seeing additional activity as well",neg,train
"Yes, as you relate to fiscal 2018 not very significantly from a standpoint we will have owned it for a portion of the year only and as you saw that it’s relatively small compared to the size of our overall business",neg,train
"Engine segment sales for the second quarter were $244 million, a decrease of approximately $70 million compared to the prior year",neg,train
"Engine unit sales decreased by 10% or approximately 180,000 engines in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 mainly due to the timing changes we had anticipated",neg,train
There is a lot that goes into that and you remeasure it on an annualized basis,neg,train
So it’s a little bit tough at this point in time to give you the guidance as to where that will go,neg,train
"And so at this point as we do the math refinancing those significantly prior to their due date if you will, it hasn't been advantageous",neg,train
"Joe, we don't guide to that level of granularity, but I would say the biggest change that occurred is the additional sales of generators particularly portable generators coming off the hurricane activity",neg,train
Otherwise where we believe we’re largely in line with what we anticipated at the beginning of the year and I really encouraged as Todd mentioned by the over 15% growth of our commercial offerings on a trailing 12 basis two or three quarters this year that’s the way our first half of this year rather,neg,train
"Things are different today than they were five, six, seven years ago as it relates to some of the benefits that consumers get",neg,train
So it does we are increasing our marketing spend for demand creation,neg,train
Second quarter results reflected temporary decline in gross margin primarily related to sales mix and lower production volumes compared to last year as we had anticipated,neg,train
SG&A expenses which increased year-over-year were also in line with our expectations and include incremental investments supporting growth of commercial sales,neg,train
Mark will provide details on these and other items in his prepared remarks,neg,train
"Example of new products include our Allmand towable air compressors and towable generator line, as well as our Ferris mowers with oil guard",neg,train
Generator sales were slightly lower in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as last year's second quarter sales were bolstered by more significant hurricane activity last year,neg,train
"First, regarding engine sales, following consecutive seasons of suboptimal spring weather, we expect our engine OEM customers to produce its close to seasonal demand as possible",neg,train
This could have the impact of shifting engine sales from the third quarter too early in our fourth quarter,neg,train
"First, we intend to make a voluntary contribution to the plan of up to $50 million in the third fiscal quarter",neg,test
"By making this contribution prior to mid-March, we deduct the contribution at the 35% federal tax rate that was in place prior to tax reform thus making the contribution more impactful on an after-tax basis",neg,test
That concludes our prepared comments and now I like to open the call up for questions,neg,train
"So while we've seen some inflationary pressures on the material side and little bit on transportation, we believe that the modest pricing we have will offset that in combination with the efficiency improvements we anticipate earning",neg,train
I will turn the call back over to our presenters,neg,train
"Our engine and products today provide substantially better performance and benefits to homeowners including easy starting, low maintenance, efficient storage and less noise",neg,train
"And just two more questions to start and regarding to the acquisition that you made, is that going to be accretive to EPS at all do you expect?",neg,train
"Importantly, we remain confidently on track with our strategic initiatives which we highlighted at our Investor Day in November to deliver 3% to 5% sales growth and better than 8% adjusted operating margin over the next 3 to 5 years",neg,train
For the second quarter we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0,neg,train
"39 includes one-time tax charges related to the implementation of tax reform, as well as anticipated cost for business optimization initiatives",neg,train
Fiscal 2019 will be the first full year we were able to use the new lower corporate tax rate which we estimate will decrease our effective tax rate to a range of approximately 26% to 28% on a go forward basis,neg,train
federal statutory rate of 21% plus state taxes which add approximately 300 basis points to the effective tax rate,neg,train
Lastly we expect higher ESG&A spending in the third quarter compared to a year ago related to a increase marketing activity to promote our innovative products to both homeowners and commercial users,neg,train
"In addition, we expect a modest increase in spending related to our ERP upgrade in the third quarter",neg,train
"So is your commercial engine placement similar, but those units or those mowers are just outperforming the market and so your commercial engine revenue is growing very nicely is that how you get that?",neg,train
"The storms were not as big as the ones back in 2012, you know that one took 12 to 18 months for a follow-on but we do anticipate that the activity will continue",neg,train
"So when we look at the product placement that we had this year, it was consistent but when you look at some of the placements we achieved in some of the higher value type stuff we want to make sure that people know about it",neg,train
"My name is James, and I will be your conference operator today",neg,train
"At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings Call",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Joe Mondillo,neg,train
We continue to anticipate that fiscal 2018 year-end inventories dollars will be lower than at the end of fiscal 2017,neg,test
"Engine segment adjusted ESG&A increased in the second quarter of 2018 by approximately $2 million due to higher employee compensation expenses, and higher costs associated with our ERP upgrade project",neg,train
Costs associated with our ERP project increased by approximately $1 million which was slightly lower than our expectation,neg,train
The third component includes the upgrade of our ERP system which remains firmly on track to go live just following the end of fiscal 2018,neg,train
These initiatives are on track to reduce annual pretax expenses by $30 million to $35 million in addition to supporting profitable growth in our businesses,neg,train
"Regarding the market outlook for the year, we continue to anticipate that the markets for commercial products will grow mid single digits we remain confident in our abilities to continue to gain market share in commercial turf and lawn care commercial job site and commercial engines",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
We plan to do more to communicate our story to capture demand as more people return to home ownership,neg,train
Let me just say our future is bright we are following a sound business strategy built on a foundation of innovation execution and capital discipline,neg,test
Our results for the first half of fiscal 2018 give us increasing confidence in our ability to meet our long-term objectives,neg,train
At the end of the quarter last 12 month average funded debt was $291 million and last 12 month EBITDA was $165 million or as defined by our credit agreement resulting in a leverage ratio of a modest 1,neg,train
And so we still feel very confident about where the season is going to materialize it's just a matter of working through the production schedule with the OEMs,neg,train
We continue to estimate modest market growth for the U,neg,train
residential mower market in addition to some normalization of channel inventory levels in spring weather conditions,neg,train
For the upcoming lawn and garden season our engine placement is consistent with last year and in line with our expectations,neg,train
"Yes, I would say especially as it relates to the riding mowers that we talked about being lower in production, we don't sell those through the mass retail channel",neg,train
As we think about a lot of our comments around channel inventory really focused on the engine side of the house our OEM business,neg,train
And that's where the majority of those residential engines are ultimately sold through the mass retailers,neg,train
"Before I turn the call back over to Todd for his closing remarks and a discussion of our updated fiscal 2018 outlook, let me spend a moment on the third quarter of fiscal 2018",neg,train
"Well we don't provide quarterly forecasts, there are couple of things to keep in mind",neg,train
And then just question on the inventory and the channel just kind of hoping you’ll add a little bit color on this,neg,test
I think you said inventory in the channel is probably lower or lower than normal relative to normal levels,neg,train
But then in the power products business you guys have reduced some production in the residential ride and the power washer product,neg,test
"So, is it just - it's different channels and different products that you're talking about that that's the difference there, I’m just trying to marry those two comments together? Thanks",neg,train
So I guess I just had a couple of smaller questions,neg,test
I guess when - Mark you talked about making some of the pension changes,neg,train
Is there any way to think about what the annualized P&L benefit from those changes might look like for you guys in terms of reduced pension expense and things?,neg,train
Our range is at $80 million to $90 million of capital spend for fiscal year 2018 which is higher than what we've been,neg,train
If you look at the year before we are at around $83 million and in the 70s is the year before that,neg,train
So it is indeed elevate as you comment to support business optimization initiatives,neg,train
Capacity still are fairly high where they can - they can out produce us substantially with regards to we make an engine they can make several times that on a product because of the amount of capacity they have,neg,test
We’re usually in borrowing against our revolving line of credit through the early springtime when we start to receive payments from stacking up the market for the upcoming year,neg,train
And so we think to do up to $50 million or in that neighborhood now in a tax-advantaged way can make a lot of sense to get a head start on that,neg,train
"Second question and while we are on tax and I probably should know this, what was the extent of the recognition of the U",neg,train
I didn't realize the extent that that was benefiting your tax rate and you eluded to deductibility on that,neg,train
Was that a very significant part or benefit to the prior tax rate if you could help?,neg,train
"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today",neg,train
At this halfway point in our fiscal year I am pleased to report that Briggs is solidly on track to meet our annual and long-range goals,neg,train
"In addition, our strategy which focuses on user driven innovation, operational excellence and capital discipline is demonstrating success",neg,train
We just wanted to give you the timing guidance that could come into play where it has in the past and could continue to shift somewhat between Q3 and Q4 as OEMs and retailers certainly want to take inventory as late as one can to meet the demand,neg,train
"While our fiscal 2018 full-year outlook contemplates growth for the year, taken together we expect that these factors will result in somewhat comparable earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to last year",neg,train
"In addition in fiscal 2018, we expect to repatriate approximately $20 million to $25 million of our overseas cash",neg,train
Even with the change in tax law our priorities for capital deployment remain unchanged,neg,train
"Namely, first to invest in to support the organic growth business including maintaining a robust pipeline of innovative new products and driving operational excellence",neg,train
The tax law however was only recently passed in the impact of implementing it represents our best estimates of this time,neg,train
We are still assessing the full impact of the tax legislation on our business which may cause us to update our estimates in the future periods,neg,train
"As Todd mentioned earlier, our generator sales in the second quarter of 2018 benefited from some follow-on sales resulting from the active hurricane season this past fall",neg,train
The product segment adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 14 basis points to 17% largely due to reduced production throughput and higher transportation costs,neg,train
Production throughput was lower in the quarter as we produced fewer pressure washers and residential riding mowers in order to right-size our inverter,neg,train
This year international customers accelerated orders into our first quarter from the second,neg,train
"distribution venture, power distributors were lower by approximately $8 million",neg,train
"As expected, power distributors is seasonally optimizing its inventory levels this year which negatively impacted our second quarter sales",neg,train
North America engine sales decreased as well in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as customers have begun ramping up production later this year compared to a year ago,neg,test
We entered the second half of fiscal 2018 having completed a solid first half of the year which benefited from strong related shipments and significant strength across the breath of our commercial lines,neg,train
And then just on input costs and maybe price I mean you seen a lot of raw material inflation,neg,train
I know you guys have more of a kind of sit down with your customers and you kind of talk about this more annually,neg,train
But how do you feel about the price cost environment today and then any sense for what FX is - the contribution from FX would be in your guidance?,neg,train
"Second, regarding commercial engines, the development and rollout of our brand-new series of single cylinder Vanguard engines is proceeding well",neg,train
"As we communicated at our recent Investor Day, this new engine series has been designed from the ground up to address the needs of contractors and other commercial end-users",neg,train
"It is an important element in our commercial engine expansion plan as it opens the door to our ability to power construction, industrial and light agricultural equipment around the world",neg,test
"So remember Joe and maybe add just a little more color, when you look at, our Ferris mowers have been doing well, many of those Ferris mowers have our commercial engines on them",neg,train
Tax rates for many of our foreign subsidiaries are now higher than the U,neg,train
Accordingly we expect that our blended foreign tax rate will be additive to our effective tax rate whereas historically the blended foreign tax rate pulled down our effective rate,neg,train
There is also some counters as well from the Japanese yen and RMB as well which also have an impact on us and somewhat mute the impact of some of the impacts of the euro strengthening,neg,train
"So could be a possible benefit as we look forward beyond this year, but for this year everything tracking like we thought Tim",neg,train
"The third quarter results reflect good bookings, but since the bookings have been strong during the last few quarters, certain product delivery lead times were expanded",neg,train
5 million of S&C sales and $77 million of Kyocera Resale activity,neg,train
"Sales in the December quarter reflect the typical holiday seasonality, which primarily influences the U",neg,train
I would like to welcome you to the AVX conference call regarding the results for our third fiscal quarter that ended in December,neg,train
"I am Johnny Sarvis and with me today is Kirk Cummings, AVX Chief Financial Officer and we hope you have had a chance to review our earnings release and related disclosures issued earlier this morning",neg,train
"Can you comment on the capacity expansion in the industry, I believe you guys mentioned that AVX has roughly 10% capacity expansion so far, are you seeing your competitors expanding capacity in the faster or similar or slower pace compared to you guys?",neg,train
4 million and increased dividend payments and we spent $26,neg,train
3 million for facility improvements and equipment depreciation expense totaled $14,neg,train
The March quarter results will reflect a continued phase out of the Kyocera Resale business now taken direct by Kyocera and the seasonality effect of the upcoming Chinese New Year holidays in Asia,neg,train
We are currently anticipating the total company sales in the March quarter which will include an approximately $30 million reduction and the Kyocera product resale activity with the remainder of our business sales increasing in the 2% to 3% range,neg,train
We estimate that the gross profit margins in the March quarter will be in the 19% to 20% range,neg,train
"Consolidated sales, general and administrative expense should come in between $37 million and $38 million",neg,train
"The S&C acquisition was in Europe, so that was convenient",neg,train
And we would have gone forward with the planned Ethertronics acquisition with or without this tax law change,neg,train
"So I don’t think it changes our plans for what we do with the money, it just makes it a lot easier and more convenient to deal with the global cash management",neg,test
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Well, as I think I mentioned in the commentary a little bit earlier",neg,train
"We are selectively adjusting prices, where we are looking at, where we need margin improvement in some of those areas",neg,train
"I don’t really foresee that changing over the next couple of quarters even with the additional capacity coming along, but I think the market is still relatively tight",neg,train
So there should be some stabilization of the prices from that,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Jim Suva,neg,train
Industry estimates for 2018 defense spending is to grow for the fifth consecutive year at 3,neg,train
"The equipment portion of that spending will increase by nearly 7% a record high, which gives us optimism in our outlook for the military products",neg,train
"Overall, demand remains robust and broad-based across many end markets",neg,train
So although they may – some may be slowing and other segments they’re picking up the demand on the demand side,neg,train

"So with the increased capacity in terms of pricing would you see any divergence in previous ASP erosions or possible ASP increases with the additional capacity as well as the 12-week, 20-week lead time in the market currently?",neg,train
The communication infrastructure market is dominated by design activities surrounded 5G systems,neg,train
carrier announced their choice of the Korean supplier to build 5G the equipment supporting point-to-point 5G broadband network rolled out in selected cities like this calendar year,neg,train
"In the Automotive segment, the light vehicle sales in U",neg,train
This was heavily – this was heavy incentive offers in December pushing to achieve the positive year-on-year growth,neg,train
"Overall, orders for the industry have been strong during the past several quarters reflecting the tight supply of certain talent and high capacitance ceramic components",neg,train
"Certain customers, particularly in the distribution channel, increased their long-term orders to secure future availability",neg,test
Product lead times have stabilized and this quarter reflect the start of an anticipated gradual correction of the backlog with the gross book-to-bill for AVX in the quarter at 1,neg,train
"Actually not much change because, if you exclude the S&C addition roughly 23%, 24% of the AVX business was automotive",neg,train
The only exception that we see typically on quarter-to-quarter basis is in the cellular group where usually the first calendar quarter is the lowest quarter of the year,neg,train
"Other global markets did grow in 2017, and the expectation is for global growth to come in around 2",neg,train
The increased attention to electrification autonomous vehicles only drives more demand growth for our products,neg,train
"In this quarter, the distribution channel represented 39% of our overall shipments, a lower percentage than historically since the S&C business is primarily direct sales",neg,train
The inventory in the distribution channel appears to be in good shape,neg,train
"As a percentage of the total, Europe represents 42% of our sales",neg,test
This is higher than historically since the S&C business is currently highly concentrated in Europe,neg,train
The Asia region represented 34% of our overall shipments and this will decline since the decreasing Kyocera Resale business is heavily concentrated in that region and the Americas represents 24% of the AVX total,neg,train
"Addressing the various market segments that we serve, the PC market did not return to growth in 2017 declining in the low single-digit area",neg,train
"There is some optimism for 2018, but we see this largely as a flat market for this year",neg,train
Our participation in this market is in the application specific components for high-end products,neg,train
"In contrast, the server market is expected continuous growth of about 7% and 8% driven by the increasing amount of data to be process with a coming of 5G IoT and artificial intelligence technologies",neg,test
Let me – let me see if I can address one of the [indiscernible],neg,train
"The comment about lead times, we pretty much level off at around a 20-week lead time area have been for the last – this quarter and previous quarter",neg,train
"So our book to bill in this quarter has been pretty much one-to-one, so we haven’t seen a big increase in the backlog",neg,train
The additional capacity that we have scheduled over the course of this fiscal year is coming online in both of those areas,neg,train
So we do anticipate some change in lead times into the last half of this year,neg,train
"Well, I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today as the acquisitions that we have been talking about for the last several quarters, we finally closed as mentioned earlier and hopefully the next one that we have to undergo we will close either or possibly in early February, so our target to get that done",neg,train
"So again right now, I think everything is going to our current strategy",neg,train
"And then can you provide some color on the overall pricing environment, has pricing improved or [indiscernible] quantified it?",neg,train
"One last question for Kurt, on capital allocation I believe that you guys have the majority of your cash accounts overseas and once you have the cash depreciation repatriation, are you going to make more acquisitions or share buyback, how should we think about the priorities of capital allocation?",neg,train
driven by the introduction of innovative products designed to address existing and future stringent application requirements,neg,train
I would now like to open it up for questions,neg,train
"So are you saying that you can increase price right now, but just I mean similar to the previous quarter, so you don’t want you to increase price because you don’t want to hurt the relationship with the customers, but you want to protect margins, is that the right way to think about it?",neg,train
"The solid-state in this market is also enjoying continued strong demand due to the same factors, but tamper this past year due to component shortages, particularly, memory",neg,train
Overall smartphones are expected to grow over 4% this year to over 1,neg,test
5 billion units a single similar low-digit outlook for 2018 is expected fueled by the continuous introduction of new products with very short development cycles and some conversion in developing countries from feature phones to entry level smartphones,neg,test
I know that in the industry there have been price increases and those have been announced publicly by several manufacturers,neg,train
"And again we are adjusting prices, but those are selectively and not across the board",neg,test
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Alvin Park,neg,train
"In the products the ceramic division was down 2 points at 14%, tantalum was at 21%, down from the previous 27%, advance components was 18% as compared to 24% from the last quarter",neg,train
The KED resale group 16% as compared to 21% and the interconnect sensors and control group was 31% as compared to the previous 12%,neg,test
"If you look excluding the S&C group, we are pretty much constant than what we were last quarter",neg,train
"Now, looking at the market segments in the automotive we are at 40%, again driven by the inclusion of the S&C group, cellular is 12%, computer 10%, consumer 9%, industrial 9%, medical 5%, military 3%, networking 3% and telecom 9%",neg,train
Again to reiterate if we take out the S&C pretty much our slip is pretty much the way it was last quarter,neg,train
"Relative to acquisitions, we completed one and recently announced another",neg,train
These acquisitions will better position us to serve more of this broad-based electronic demand,neg,train
"With many of these diverse segments, there are some elements of wireless connectivity",neg,train
This quarter contains several moving parts as compared to previous quarters,neg,train
"The early October acquisition of the AB Electronic sensing and control business, which we now call the S&C business now included in our interconnect product group and the gradual phase out of the Kyocera Resale business to be taken direct by Kyocera",neg,test
"With these, the historical and future quarter comparisons get a little tricky",neg,train
"tax law that recently went into effect and a recent reduction in the tax rates in France, we recorded a significant one-time tax cost in the December order as well as the adjusted year-to-date income tax provision to reflect the lower U",neg,train
The one-time tax expense relates to accumulated overseas earnings that have not been repatriated back to or tax by the U,neg,train
The good news is it now opens AVX up to the possibility of bringing cash maintained overseas back into the U,neg,test
"for investment in the business, payment of dividends, stock repurchases and the acquisition of minimal future tax cost",neg,train
This does conclude today’s AVX Corporation’s third quarter earnings release conference call,neg,test
Several of our divisions are selectively adjusting prices in areas that require margin improvement,neg,train
Product lead times for tantalum ceramic have now stabilized as we’re starting to see our capacity expansion from online,neg,train
"The gross profit percentage at 19% was consistent with our expectation after taking into account the expense resulting from the preliminary acquisition accounting for the S&C business, which includes $2",neg,train
5 million a quarterly acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense,neg,train
"And going forward with the tax rate I think, there was a true-up to 23% this quarter excluding the repatriation tax, do you think the 27% rate is something you will be seeing consistently going forward?",neg,train
We as I said earlier we are selectively adjusting prices on products that where margins had been an issue in previous quarter and previous years,neg,train
And relative to that area we are on a broad based area,neg,train
We are not trying to adjust prices in an upward manner,neg,train
We are more to stabilize the current products that we have and adjust the ones where we need margin improvement,neg,train
As mentioned previously the new tax law revisions dramatically impacted our tax provision in the quarter which in turn dramatically impacted the GAAP per share amounts,neg,train
The adjustment of the year-to-date taxes on operations after taking into account the right reductions resulted in 23% effectively tax rate in the December quarter as compared to prior quarters at 29%,neg,train
As mentioned previously the one-time tax charges of approximately $129,neg,test
8 million were reported primarily as a result of the U,neg,train
tax law related to unrepatriated foreign earnings and the effect of the U,neg,train
and France tax rate deductions on net deferred tax assets,neg,train
"Hi and this is Kirk Cummings, the whole tax thing is still a work in progress, but the 27% reflects a blended rate for our fiscal year ending in March",neg,train
Then when we look at the next fiscal year ending in March 2019 that rate should decline given that the lower U,neg,test
"So I suspect that our 27% blended rate for this fiscal year will probably drop to the 23%, 24% range next year",neg,train
My name is Angela and I will be your conference operator,neg,train
"At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AVX Corporation’s Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call",neg,train
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise,neg,train
"After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session",neg,test
"And in terms of distribution and inventory with these type prices, have you been seeing any further build or contraction or has been pretty much steady in terms, I mean similar to previous quarters in terms of inventory at the distribution level?",neg,train
"Q3 in isolations going to be in 28% to 29% rate, given the 28% statutory effective tax rate for the balance of 2018, our fiscal 2018",neg,train
Q4 in isolation will be in a range of 34% to 34,neg,test
"5%, given the further re-measurement than of our certain deferred taxes and liabilities will take place as we transition then from that 28% blended rate for this year to the 21% of effective statutory rate for fiscal 2019",neg,train
The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the enactment of the U,neg,train
"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduces the company's U",neg,train
"federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018",neg,train
"statutory rate for the company's fiscal 2018, which was 28",neg,train
"And then on pricing Dave if I heard you right you said you are seeing supplier inflation come through, maybe just talk a little bit about maybe the magnitude of that inflation that you are seeing right now and if you have been able to sort of pass that along successfully",neg,test
And what type of benefit should we expect maybe on the top-line from pricing and just for larger inflation here going forward?,neg,train
Our gross profit percentage of the quarter for the quarter was 28,neg,train
Inventory inflationary headwinds resulted in LIFO expense being recorded in the quarter compared to LIFO income in the prior year quarter,neg,train
The year-over-year swing generated a 28 basis points adverse impact on gross margins,neg,train
While this adverse impact was offset with price and benefits from other margin initiatives sales mix in the quarter resulted in slightly lower year-over-year margins,neg,train
"At this time, I am showing, we have no further questions",neg,test
"No, new thoughts kind of beyond what we guided as we announced the transaction",neg,test
"Our speakers today include Neil Schrimsher, Applied's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Wells, our Chief Financial Officer",neg,train

"We’re pleased with this latest development and now expect to close the transaction on January 31, 2018",neg,train
"With volume trends picking up across a lot of industries now, can you talk about current inventory levels relative to demand and are you seeing any hitches in the supply chain in terms of lead times pushing out for any types of products?",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research,neg,train
I will now turn the call over to Julie Kho,neg,train
"Consolidated sales from our other country operations which include Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore increased 14",neg,train
2% compared to the same quarter in the prior year,neg,train
"Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales increased by $13 million or 13",neg,train
We have backlog about 15% to Fluid Power business within the quarter,neg,train
"So, I'd say kind of doing a good job in the business and offsetting that impact, and see that inflationary impact starting to stabilize, as we move to the quarter",neg,train
We expect our resulting full year effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be in the 31% to 32% and we expect our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate to range from 23% to 24%,neg,test
Second quarter sales in our service center-based distribution segment increased $41,neg,test
"2%, and favorable foreign currency translation increased sales by $4",neg,train
"Also today, we announced that our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend at $0",neg,train
"30 per common share, demonstrating our cash generation and commitment to increasing shareholder value",neg,train
Your next question comes from Chris Danker from Longbow Research,neg,train
We're seeing about to have a low three in terms of inflationary impact income 3% up in terms of the supplier price increases,neg,train
Those seem to be starting to level off at this point in terms of what being passed on to us,neg,train
"Sure, on the oil and gas markets, continue to be productive for us, for the quarter that did drive just over a point of our overall growth",neg,train
"On the sales per day trends in Q2, we know it improved overall around a 120 basis points",neg,train
"Really the development from October to November, we had improvements and really throughout most of November just right up until or between the holiday period",neg,train
"Then month [ph] a day January has continued as expected, mid-single-digit increase year-over-year of low single-digit compared to kind of the December and but again not surprising given the quarter-end closing around December in that site",neg,test
"I guess to clarify first off, how do we think about FCX in terms of guide to that baked in at this point, or will that be kind of rolled in once the deal closes officially? And kind of any new thoughts on how we should think about for fiscal 2019 at this point?",neg,train
"All forward-looking statements including those made during the question-and-answer portion speak only as of the date hereof and are based on current expectations that are subject to certain risks, including trends in various industry sectors and geographies, the success of our various business strategies and other risk factors provided in our press release and identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the SEC, which are available at the Investor Relations section of our website at applied",neg,train
"With that, I will turn the call back over to Neil for some final comments",neg,train
Your next question comes from Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research,neg,train
"Selling, distribution and administrative expenses reflected nice volume leverage totaling 21",neg,test
2% of sales from the quarter as compared to 22,neg,train
2% with foreign currency exchange driving 80 basis points of this increase in acquisitions adding another 80 basis points,neg,train
"Excluding the impact of acquisitions and favorable currency translation, SG&A increased 3",neg,train
6% during the quarter compared to the prior year quarter,neg,train
I’ll now move on to provide some additional insights on our second quarter fiscal 2018 financial performance,neg,train
9% positive impact on sales and foreign currency translation provided a 0,neg,test
The number of selling days in the quarter was consistent year-over-year,neg,train
"In our fourth quarter however, we expect our aggregate effective tax rate to return to a range of 34% to 34",neg,train
"5% as we record expense related to the further re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities from the revised fiscal year 2018, 28% rate to the 21% fiscal year 2019 U",neg,train
"Despite tougher second half comps, a revised guidance assumes 6% to 7% sales growth for the year, given another solid quarter under our balance, the productive outlook for near-term industrial markets and continued traction generate from execution of our strategic priorities",neg,train
We stay close with really are key or all of our suppliers and we know their service or their performance,neg,train
"My first question Neil, maybe you can just provide some detail how the quarter progress with regard to the sales growth rate, and any color you can give on January so far? I know there has been some weather impact, it seems like for some distributors, any color around that and what you guys are thinking so far here, I guess year-to-date?",neg,train
"Sure, so the sales performance in the top 30, we had 20 industries with increases, gap a little bit from the last couple of quarters, positives around oil and gas also aggregates primary metals, so positives with the machinery OEMs and also chemicals, kind of a bounce back, we had some softness in the last quarter and I think that was more timing around hurricanes then, so we saw that positives of that coming in this quarter and also food",neg,train
"Regarding our full year outlook, as referenced in today's earnings release, we raised the range on our fiscal year 2018 earnings guidance of between $3",neg,train
39 per share at the prior estimated 34% effective tax rate,neg,train
I would say maybe looking back there is a little acquisition impact in it,neg,train
"But it's at a high level, it's at a historically high, high level in that",neg,train
And the work going on across those Fluid Power Groups of connecting with these mobile and in OEM customers and the technical solutions that we're bringing to them,neg,train
"Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that we'll discuss Applied's business outlook during this conference call and make statements that are considered forward-looking",neg,train
"Obviously, it's -- no matter where you go with just in time inventory environment now",neg,test
But have you guys seen any restocking benefit given kind of how some of these industries have seen a step change in demand?,neg,train
"When you look across the product lines, and I'm, this is an inflation-oriented question",neg,train
Are you seeing bigger increases based on things with high steel content or things that are highly engineered? Just trying to get a sense from where the upstream pricing pressure is across those products?,neg,train
"How do we think about the back half of the year now for gross margins in the context of some of the growth you’re seeing there for those large accounts and pricing? And Neil is the expectation that you still have the ability to see that I think in the past, you talked about 20 to 30 basis points or so of margin improvements, that still good bogey, once things settle out? Thanks",neg,train
"You’re right, I mean the nature of the charge is such that they are more non-cash weighted",neg,train
"I would say the characteristics of the FCX business in terms of cash generation, the cash profile are very candid out of Applied, so not at all capital intensive, nice conversion in terms of receivables and not a significant impact in terms of inventory carrying",neg,train
I wanted to start with some of the gross margin commentary that you have,neg,train
"I guess you had mentioned that you took advantage of some purchasing program, supplier incentives, I guess that's pretty typically",neg,train
"And in December, but in inflationary environment, I would think that that should start to release your potential gross margin benefit for Applied in the second half of the year",neg,train
"Do you think that's going to come through on the gross margin line over the next two quarters, or is it too small to really move the needle?",neg,test
"Again, I'm going to remind you about the variability and you can have quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year SKU sales, it's really less than a quarter of those that repeat year-over-year but looking at the -- we do have a like match, just to understand the impact of both the supplier price increases and we've been able to pass on in terms of that price",neg,train

"And then, I guess my last question and I'll hop back in the queue",neg,train
"So, the gross margins, it sounds like it was some impact there from changes in LIFO in the way you are counting there with regard to the inflation, and certainly some of the mix impact as well",neg,train
"Going back to the price cost considerations in the back half, incremental operating contribution margins have been about 15% in the past two quarters, is that a good run rate we should be thinking about for the base business in the mid-single-digit growth environment?",neg,train

"As we work down calendar year-end program related inventory purchases and recognize anticipated benefits of our working capital management initiatives currently ongoing, we are still targeting cash generation from operating activities for the fiscal 2018 to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, despite the impact of higher business volumes",neg,train
"No, marked change from a prior year phenomenon, you may have seen, Adam",neg,train

And then just any commentary on current bidding activity in addition to what the fluid power backlog looks like right now?,neg,train
"During the quarter, we also purchased 146,000 shares of treasury stock on the open market at an average cost of $61",neg,train
"I think all-in-all across our business groups, many good job of matching and passing through we increases as we think about the point of sale side of it",neg,train
"And then the mix that he alluded to or talked about a little bit, I think we just had the nice growth with some larger accounts",neg,train
We also had nice growth with all other accounts as they would go in that just slightly higher in this quarter with a few of the larger accounts,neg,train
"Now with a closer look at our financial performance for the quarter, here is Dave",neg,train

Our consolidated balance sheet remains strong with shareholders' equity of $779 million,neg,train
Our after-tax return on assets for the quarter was 9%,neg,train
A sequential increase in inventory December 2017 resulted from higher business volumes and the timing impact of inventory purchases related to the calendar year-end buying incentives and programs offered by certain strategic suppliers,neg,train
"As we look forward to our June fiscal year-end, we expect operational inventory levels to decrease by $20 million to $30 million",neg,train
I think the last quarter you've talked about some incremental employee cost are rolling through in the back half of the year as well as some IT investments,neg,train
Is there a way to maybe quantify what the incremental cost headwind will be here in the back half of the year? Thanks,neg,train
"From a geographic perspective, sales from the quarter for our U",neg,train
"What we’re targeting in terms of when we think about those incremental dollars and the follow-through that we would expect on those, so would not see any characteristics that would change that in the back half of the year",neg,train
"And just quickly last on the FCX acquisition, I guess, you have already provided some numbers in terms the dilution that’s expected for the fiscal years and absorb a lot of one-time costs and it would seem that a lot of those are non-cash charges and the accretion from the acquisition, I mean just for the balance of the fiscal year to be over 10% cash, I guess doing the rough numbers we have -- I'm just wondering on a run rate basis, how we should think about the cash contribution from the acquisition putting all the non-cash charges aside",neg,test
"As noted in our release, we will provide further guidance to include the partial year impacted results from the acquisition of FCX Performance in conjunction with announcing the close of the transaction, which has now anticipated to take place on January 31, 2018",neg,train
"So, I think you see a very nice combination as we bring the businesses together",neg,train
We will get back with specific guidance as we make the announcement here at the end of the quarter but expect to certainly tighten that range in terms of the magnitude even that the one-time cost versus what we are initially contemplating,neg,train
I don't know if there is so much restocking as I think across industries right now,neg,train
"Activity is good, and so therefore the product requirements in the services and solutions to them are, we are increasing at a good pace",neg,test
"So good activity going across, including heavy industries which can chew up mechanical part to require them",neg,train
"And so, I think that's good for the broader industrial economic environment",neg,train
I just want to thank everyone again for taking the time to join us,neg,train
And we look forward to talking with many of you throughout the quarter,neg,train
"And, I wonder if you could give an update on the 30 industry groups you track and the performance there for the quarter?",neg,train
And would you mind giving us an update on the efforts you talked about last quarter to improve a receivable collection?,neg,train
But we're working very hard with them on clear signals and then how we leverage the I guess the productive pull through of both businesses that we're focused on serving these customers,neg,test
"And then to the discussion of the top 30 industries, what is declining year-over-year now for Applied versus kind of the pressure and I guess within that group, where do you feel better about maybe the momentum is changing, and we could have more than 20 industries growing?",neg,train
"Through our business execution and strategic investments, we continue to strengthen our differentiated industrial distribution capabilities",neg,train
"Okay, and you have talked a little bit about FCX, but is that reasonable to think that incremental there are higher than the base business just given the higher gross margin maybe the mix of businesses or is that not necessarily right?",neg,train
"Excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency translation, organic sales increased $35",neg,train
The most recent quarter service center segment results benefited from positive growth in all businesses and geographies,neg,train
"And then finally, would you mind repeating the expectation for the tax rate for 3Q and 4Q?",neg,train
I think on those maybe they all tend to still group together,neg,train
"And so, some of that maybe to drive that behavior, that they're either harder to make or they have",neg,train
"So, older and legacy products, can we have a higher increase attached to them versus some of the others",neg,train
"It would tend to be higher than what we would see, just given the incremental gross margin profile in that business",neg,train

"Just the good reminder Ryan, that yes, we did have taking place January 1 the focused merit increases, which would increase kind of our employment cost and average 3%",neg,train
"So, given that that's about 70% or so of our SG&A cost base",neg,train
We expect to increase in the range of $3 million to $4 million,neg,train
As you look at the that impact from the merit to another inflationary increase as well as some of the IT spend that we discussed,neg,train
"I'll start, and I would say, we still have the objective to grow margin 20 to 30 basis points a year, and clearly view we have the potential to do that",neg,train
We understand Dave talked about some of the rising inflation and given the LIFO treatment that came in,neg,train
Could you talk about the oil and gas markets and how much that contributed to the sales increase in the quarter and what your outlook for that market is going forward?,neg,train
"But I would say it contributes, but it contributes like it has in the past",neg,train
And it really contributes when we have ready to sale to go through and do that,neg,train
"So, it will start as a capitalized and then when we have sale activity, it would get attached to those products and sales",neg,test
"So, we will see benefit, but this has occurred in past years as well",neg,test
Your next question comes from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research,neg,train
"Despite average headcount for the quarter being down slightly year-over-year, the majority of this increase -- our employment cost, which were attributed to wage economics and performance-based incentives",neg,train

"First on TYSABRI stroke, I am curious your expectations for the 600 mg dose arm on the primary endpoint as well as how you think about the more – the longer time from stroke onset to have the role on the primary endpoint? And then separately, when I look at your slide on readouts for this year, one thing I noticed is your partner Alkermes had mentioned they will have data from the head-to-head study versus TECFIDERA at least for the 100 patients in early 2018 is what they had guided to for the readout over the course of last year",neg,train
And I was curious if you have that data in-house anything you are seeing from that? Thank you,neg,train

"TYSABRI worldwide revenues were $463 million this quarter, a decrease of 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
We saw an impact on TYSABRI shortly following the launch of OCREVUS both in terms of new patient starts and patient discontinuations,neg,train
"However, we believe both of these trends have now stabilized at new run-rate",neg,test

Our GAAP financials are provided in Tables 1 and 2,neg,train
Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results,neg,train
We believe non-GAAP financial results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and reflect how we manage the business internally,neg,test
We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call,neg,train
"Interferon revenues including both AVONEX and PLEGRIDY were $645 million for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 6% versus Q4 ‘16 due to continued shift from the injectable platforms to oral or high efficacy therapies",neg,train
", AVONEX and PLEGRIDY benefited from the inventory build of approximately $15 million, while outside the U",neg,train
", Avonex benefited from a $9 million shipment to Brazil, neither of which are expected to recur in the first quarter of 2018",neg,train
Let me now provide a little more detail on our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 and share with you our guidance for 2018,neg,train
"As Michel mentioned earlier, we had a strong Q4 2017 from a revenue perspective",neg,train
Total revenues for Q4 grew 15% year-over-year to approximately $3,neg,train
3 billion and grew 7% for the full year to $12,neg,train
"Excluding the impact of the spinoff of our hemophilia business, total revenue grew 26% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year versus the prior year periods",neg,train
I was wondering if you could talk a little about how the price increases for MS and FX contributed to your 2018 guidance and then what element is just growth? Thanks,neg,train
"From Michael, just following up on the earlier comments on TYSABRI and stroke, how do you think about the hurdle for potentially moving that into Phase 3 given clearly need, but balanced by the [indiscernible] we have seen with prior assets that had encouraging initial data? Thank you",neg,train
Your next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs,neg,train
"For our second strategic priority, spinal muscular atrophy, we delivered one of the most exciting biotech launch of the year with SPINRAZA global revenues of $884 million exceeding many expectations",neg,train
"As of the end of 2017, there were approximately 3,200 patients on therapy across the post-marketing setting, the EAP and clinical trials",neg,train
"And we are exploring a number of avenues, including device partnerships to improving surgical delivery with the recent example being our research collaboration agreement with Alcyone to leverage the device platform",neg,train
This would obviously be a substantial change to standard of care [indiscernible] out there is for TPA and a thrombolytic really only approved in 4 hours to 5 hours after the stroke,neg,train
And we think that it makes sense in terms of the known pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke where in the period after the infarct you have got this period of intense brain inflammation that’s associated with poor clinical outcomes,neg,train
And we are testing two different doses or perhaps you were getting at which is to see whether or not there is any dose dependent difference in clinical benefit,neg,train
"First, we will have to wait for the data and as always these are Phase 2 clinical studies and we will have to see what it shows, but where to be positive we think that this would represent a significant advance",neg,train
"We have not made the determination exactly when data will be presented out of that, but that’s something that we are working through with Alkermes",neg,train
"This is very early, it’s a preclinical, but we will get it to the clinic this year",neg,test
"This is a key component of nuclear export and they had done a lot of collaborative work, very nice scientific work showing that this could reduce the hallmark pathology of sporadic ALS, which is the cytoplasmic accumulation of these toxic RNA binding proteins like TDP-43 and FUS, which undergo unclear export that can be blocked at this way",neg,train
"So, the hypothesis is that this could be an oral drug potentially for sporadic ALS",neg,train
"This really complements our ASO programs with Ionis that are really targeting initially genetic forms of ALS like the SOD1 mutant ALS, which is a subset",neg,train
"So, we have got very complementary modalities, completely orthogonal mechanisms and potentially distinct clinical populations",neg,train
Your next question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company,neg,train
Full year GAAP and non-GAAP R&D expense were both 18% of revenue or $2,neg,test
Q4 GAAP SG&A was 17% of revenue or $572 million,neg,test
Q4 non-GAAP SG&A was also 17% of revenue at $554 million,neg,train
Full year GAAP SG&A was 16% of sales or $1,neg,train
9 billion and non-GAAP SG&A was 15% of revenue at $1,neg,train
"Both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A increase versus the prior quarter due to the timing of spend as well as certain investments across sales and marketing, worldwide medical and G&A",neg,train
We do expect slight relief in core OpEx in the first quarter 2018 with the gradual decline as we move throughout the year,neg,train
We did suffer on the GI discontinuation on track even if we did improve a couple of points,neg,test
There is still a long way go the oral market of the MS TMTs is going much faster than the other segments,neg,train
"And with the longer patent life, this opens plenty of opportunities beyond the priority that we just spoke about",neg,train
I will now turn the call over to Michel for his closing comments,neg,train
"So, I will initiate the answer and then my colleagues will add",neg,train
And I am pleased with what we have done in 2017 and what we have continuing to do in ‘18,neg,train
I don’t see a frenzy of increase of because of more cash,neg,train
"I see strategic intent, science, scientific rationale first, patents and ordered and financial rigor in order to rationalize any move from the company",neg,train
"We are contemplating larger assets as you can imagine, but I will stop here and I will let Jeff comment, it’s important as the new CFO and Mike from the therapy point of view",neg,train
Thank you and welcome to Biogen’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call,neg,train
"Just have a few quick ones, for Jeff is there a tipping point in the biosimilars business that would make the option for the JV more attractive and I am assuming that the status quo is assumed in 2018 guidance",neg,test
"And then for Michel just to ask the bus dev question another way, if you had to choose the priority would it be to diversify pipeline risk say over the longer term or more to augment P&L growth say in the next few years? Thank you",neg,train
"Moving on to our progress and movement disorders, BIIB054, our anti alpha-synuclein antibody for Parkinson’s disease has recently started the Phase 2 study called SPARC and we dosed the first patient earlier this month",neg,train
"In Phase 1, the drug was well-tolerated at doses that are being used in the Phase 2 study and its safety profile and pharmacokinetic behavior, including CSF concentrations in both healthy control and Parkinson’s disease patients was acceptable and consistent with other monoclonal antibodies",neg,test
"Within acute neurology, we are currently conducting a Phase IIb trial with natalizumab in acute ischemic stroke with the aim of improving functional outcomes by limiting brain inflammation and therefore increasing neuronal survival in the post stroke period",neg,train
The study is fully enrolled and we anticipate sharing top line results in the coming weeks,neg,train
"So I mean steps to be taken I think these are lot of the known in standard steps, essentially about trial design, material preparation, site activation, etcetera",neg,train
"So there is – there are no kind of surprises in the steps to get to the clinic here, but things that we consider are also lot of known things",neg,train
"As we are designing this, which are the patient subset, way to delivery, we think a lot about manufacturing",neg,train
"We think a lot about the safety features for these agents, still early days across the space in gene therapy, so we think a lot about that",neg,train
Another thing that we are spending a lot of time contemplating is how we would want to be able to demonstrate clinical benefit and the potential space for a gene therapy where we think there is a lot of opportunity together with SPINRAZA,neg,train
"So, look I think the profile here that we are looking at is to see whether or not this is different fumarate pro drug has a different profile in terms of GI tolerability",neg,train
This is something which we will play out in trial designs in looking at adverse events and ultimately probably will play out in the real world setting,neg,train
So we are looking at that as kind of a potential clinical differentiator and that will be based on the data that we see,neg,train
Ultimately the head-to-head comparison may allow us to get a better feeling for that,neg,train
"And concerning your second part of the question we are not on the burning platform, we are doing reasonably well in terms of top line momentum as you can see",neg,train
I will now turn the call over to Mike for a more detailed update on our recent progress in R&D,neg,train
I mean this is one of the reasons why we have spent a lot of time really thinking about this,neg,train
"And there is a lot of reasons for that I think one macro reasons that people have learned how to conduct is better with the advent of endovascular thrombectomies, trials are actually working now",neg,train
"And so based on the data we obtain from action one, we have revised our study design and our endpoint selection",neg,train
"And so we do think that out of this study the data that we will get, we will be able to know whether or not the clinical benefit that we saw across action one and action two whether it’s real or not",neg,train
And it has to be real for us to take it into the Phase 3,neg,train
Thanks for all the added transparency on SPINRAZA and some of the other numbers,neg,test
Maybe for Jeff on SPINRAZA you spoke to faster ex-U,neg,test
"I guess for BIIB089 so formerly ALKS 8700, what type of clinical profile do you need to see relative to TECFIDERA to be confident this product is differentiated and if it ultimately is what are your early thoughts about the potential commercial strategy for that product? Thanks",neg,train
", we had very strong TYSABRI growth of 14% versus prior year driven by both the large order of $6 million in Russia as well as solid growth in all major European countries driven by patient growth following the label update in 2017",neg,train

", an increase of 4% versus Q4 ‘16 and $244 million outside the U",neg,train
", an increase of 22% versus the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
Despite the benefit of a roughly $20 million increase of inventory in the channel in the U,neg,train
We are pleased with our net low single-digit growth versus Q4 ‘16 as we absorb the impact of OCREVUS,neg,train
"In addition, we are very encouraged by the growth outside the U",neg,train
driven by patient growth across almost every large market in Europe and strong emerging market growth,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Your next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Jaffray,neg,train
"So, I will get started and Jeff will come in",neg,train
"Okay, so we need to take that into account and it is expected that the suitable proportion of the later onset has complicated spine and therefore it takes more time to dose those patients",neg,train
"So, we are come to start out the patients where there is a bit less urgency to treat and some of them have more complicated spine",neg,train
"I just want to ask on your SMA gene therapy product, what are the steps that you have to take to get that started by the middle of the year and can you talk about potential differentiation versus the existing SMA gene therapy product that’s in the clack? Thanks",neg,train

We also had exciting new developments within Alzheimer’s disease and dementia,neg,test
We presented new interim data from the long-term extension of the ongoing Phase 1b study of aducanumab called PRIME at the clinical trials in Alzheimer disease meeting in November,neg,train
We believe the totality of the data from the Phase 1b study is compelling and supports the design of the Phase 3 studies,neg,train
Phase 3 enrollment for aducanumab is going well and we anticipate the studies will be fully enrolled in mid-2018,neg,train
"Last month, we learned BAN2401 and anti-beta amyloid protofibril antibody being developed in collaboration with Eisai did not meet the criteria for success in its Phase 2 study at 12 months",neg,train

Your next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse,neg,test
"So, I will get started Eric, and then Jeff would come",neg,train
"So we are very pleased with the momentum that we see here, ex-U",neg,train
"But you know the most urgent to treat patients, the 70% achievements from the age 0 to 2, somehow is done and now we move into the year the biggest strata",neg,train
a significant opportunity and as Jeff said 70% approximately of the results to-date are generated by three markets,neg,train
"So, we still have a long way to go in terms of reimbursement that we are currently negotiating and also NPP that emerges from geographies that were non-anticipated, so still a long way to go ex-U",neg,train
"And Jeff maybe just a few kind of questions just on the P&L, because your margins certainly bounced around compared to prior periods, first you alluded to the gross margin effect of the high contract manufacturing, should we be modeling that the gross margin is going to so trend in the direction of the Q4 performance going forward, because of the contribution of that in the biosimilars mix to your overall revenue",neg,train
"And then secondly you talked about the SG&A spike in Q4 and that was significantly higher than we had anticipated, could you give us a little bit of color to the contributing factors to that spike and how that might continue going forward as we update our models? Thanks",neg,train
"Earlier this month, we entered a precompetitive consortium with several of our peers to sequence the exempts of 500,000 participants in the UK Biobank, with the goal of assisting drug discovery and development by linking protein coding variance to human phenotypes",neg,train

"Maybe a question for Michel, obviously, you have seen a ton of M&A going on in the space over the last 6 to 12 months and it’s turning up maybe you could just remind us about how you think about your strategic M&A plans and how you think about whether neurology, aware of neurology you could go and whether there are other larger market opportunities outside of neurology that you can look at? How you think about the landscape now? Thanks",neg,train
"Yes, I am not sure we are going to be able to do the math real-time for you, it’s fairly complicated, but what we did experience just to reiterate is that we did have a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter and discounts and allowances by about a couple of 100 basis points as we sell into more 340B hospitals and the Medicaid mix kind of increases",neg,train
"So, thank you all for your attention and support to our great company",neg,train
This is not something that which we are talking about yet,neg,train
I just want to highlight that these are key elements of our considerations for designing study,neg,train
And I think it will be a general feature for a lot of AAV base gene therapy efforts,neg,train
"And like I mentioned, the long-term safety profile and how that relates to route of administration transduction efficiency, patient subtype etcetera is what we are working through and those together with the development paths it might contemplate a position along with SPINRAZA we believe are all potential elements of differentiation",neg,train

Our weighted average diluted share count was approximate 212 million for the quarter and 230 million for the full year which now brings us the diluted earnings per share,neg,train
In the fourth quarter we booked the GAAP loss of $1,neg,train
GAAP EPS declined for Q4 2017 on the year-over-year basis driven by the $5,neg,test
34 impact for the Alkermes and Ionis deals and the $0,neg,train
Full year GAAP EPS decline versus 2016 due to the same factors as well as $1,neg,test
Non-GAAP EPS grew 4% for Q4 ‘17 despite the $0,neg,train
34 impact from the Alkermes and Ionis deals and the 32% impact of ZINBRYTA charge,neg,train
"Non-GAAP EPS grew 8% for the full year 2017 versus prior year, despite the same factors as well as the $1",neg,train
Let me now reflect on some of our key results across each of these priorities,neg,train
"For our first strategic priority maximizing the resilience of our MS core business, we grew global MS revenues including royalties from OCREVUS to $9",neg,train
"Our MS products now treat over 340,000 patients globally, a 3% increase over 2016",neg,train
", our MS revenues were stable versus 2016 and including OCREVUS royalties, MS revenues in the U",neg,train
"We strengthened our IP position for TECFIDERA, our leading oral therapy through a settlement and licensing agreement with Forward Pharma",neg,train
We received favorable rulings for both our IPR proceeding and interference case,neg,train
"We licensed BIIB098 from Alkermes, a Phase 3 monomethyl fumarate with a potentially differentiated profile to TECFIDERA we expect filing will occur later his year",neg,train
I would just add that we are really pleased with the performance,neg,train
So I think that the business is really well-positioned for 2018 in Europe as well as the U,neg,train
"So first question, gross margins went down Q3 to Q4 from like 88% down to 85%",neg,train
"Two factors drove that, the first was our significant growth in corporate partner revenue, it increased significantly from the third and fourth quarter and that has much lower gross margin",neg,train
I would say that contributed about two-thirds of the impact of the gross margin erosion sequentially,neg,train
The other third was the roughly $20 million inventory charge we took at ZINBRYTA,neg,train
"And as we look forward to next year, gross margin quarter-by-quarter although it’s difficult to predict excess and obsolescence charges, we obviously don’t expect that charge to recur per se",neg,train
And we also expect to have less corporate partner revenue for the quarters for next year and the margin to be slightly better,neg,train
So both of those things will abate and we expect our margins to kind of get back to the 87% range,neg,train
So we are pretty comfortable with that by quarter for gross margins,neg,train
"On the question of SG&A, you are correct that the SG&A rate did increase quite a bit sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter",neg,train
One was just basic expenses that ended up moving in from the first quarter of ‘18 to the fourth quarter which were known,neg,train
The second impact were investments with regard to our SMA business,neg,train
"We are very happy and pleased with the growth, but we are investing in it",neg,train
The third factor was year end bonus true-ups and other benefit true-ups which were typical the fourth quarter,neg,train
And then the fourth component were fees and services for projects,neg,train
So what we think happens here is the rate comes back down as we look at kind of going forward it will kind of – it will get back into kind of the our guidance range,neg,train
we more than doubled the number of commercial patients on therapy versus the prior quarter to 990 with approximately 35% of these patients transition from expanded access program or EAP,neg,test
"As a result, approximately 280 patients are still active in EAP as of the end of the fourth quarter",neg,train
It’s important to note that those patients transitioned from this program may have already completed most of their loading doses,neg,train
"SPINRAZA revenues in Q4 were Germany, Turkey and Japan, which accounted for over two-thirds of the ex-U",neg,train
"In 2018, we expect growth from SPINRAZA in the U",neg,train
", but expect a larger portion of the revenue growth to come from outside the U",neg,train
"We have 9,000 patients and we still have a long way to go",neg,train
"Before I hand it off to Jeff, I would like to spend some time highlighting several achievements from the fourth quarter starting with MS and neuroimmunology",neg,train
"As Michelle mentioned, we licensed BIIB098, the MMF compound from Alkermes in the fourth quarter and we anticipate a filing by the end of the year",neg,train
We are actively working to optimize the value and clinical potential of this asset,neg,train
2017 was clearly a very productive and successful year for Biogen,neg,train
We launched a new focused and well articulated strategy with the longer term goal of becoming the leader in neuroscience and the fastest growing large cap biotech,neg,train
"We defined priority designed to drive future growth first fortifying our core MS business; second, executing on the launch of SPINRAZA and third, creating a lean and simple operating model",neg,train
We are pleased with the work the team has done to execute on our strategy which has led to significant progress for Biogen,neg,train
My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today,neg,train
"At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Biogen Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Financial Results and Business Update",neg,train
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise,neg,train
"After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session",neg,train
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr,neg,train
"I guess, just one unrelated to like ALS in the Karyopharm and putting it together of what you are doing with Ionis if you can just talk about kind of the strategic vision there with the ALS opportunity? Thanks",neg,train
2017 was a very strong and successful year for Biogen and we delivered on the commitments we have made,neg,train
For 2018 our goal is to continue this momentum and achieve our guidance,neg,train
We have a well defined strategy to deliver near-term results and to maximize long-term value,neg,train
"Beyond aducanumab and BAN2401, we are advancing four other clinical assets in Alzheimer’s disease, including a base inhibitor; two, anti-tile antibodies and an antisense oligonucleotide in collaboration with Ionis",neg,test
Your next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"Yes, I will start on the clinical side and then see if Michel or Jeff want to jump in on the commercial differentiation and by the way it’s BIIB098 not BIIB089",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"Similar to last quarter, revenues grew at a lower rate than patients due to loading dose dynamics with roughly half of revenues coming from new patients started dosing in the fourth quarter",neg,train
", we believe that new patient starts in the fourth quarter were weighted towards the beginning of the quarter as we saw an impact on demand during the holiday weeks",neg,train
"As a result, we expect a relatively lower contribution in Q1 2018 from these patients as they will have worked through many of their loading doses in the fourth quarter 2017",neg,train
"Starting in 2018, we believe that overall the new U",neg,train
tax reform will have a positive impact to our profitability and our ability to invest for the future,neg,train
"But in Q4, we took a one-time charge of $1",neg,test
2 billion in line with what you are probably seeing from other public companies,neg,train
"Therefore, full year GAAP earnings decreased 30% versus 2016 to $11",neg,train
"81, an 8% increase versus full year 2016, while being impacted by over $500 million of expenses due to several business development transactions including our deals BMS, Alkermes and Ionis as well as our charge related to the ZINBRYTA impairment",neg,train
inventory levels for SPINRAZA were relatively flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter,neg,train
we signed increased discounts allowance for SPINRAZA of a couple of 100 basis points to approximately 16%,neg,train
We expect this rate to similarly increase over 2018 as we are seeing increasing utilization by Medicaid patients and purchasing from 340B hospitals,neg,train
over 20% of SPINRAZA patients currently on therapy are over the age of 17 and increased from last quarter,neg,train
A key strategic priority for us is to activate older patients through expanded patient and physician engagement,neg,train
We have emphasized investing in future growth while delivering near-term results and turned 2017 into one of our most productive year for business development,neg,train
4 billion at an average price of $278 a share,neg,train
"Jeff Capello has joined as Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, Chirfi Guindo has joined as Executive VP and Head of Global Marketing, Market Access and Customer Innovation",neg,train
I believe that we now have great leaders in all key position and Biogen is exhibiting well,neg,test
We have a strong base business with significant cash flow generation and exciting new growth driver in SPINRAZA and accelerating momentum in R&D and business development to solidify the foundation for future growth,neg,train
I look forward to carrying the strong performance through 2018 and beyond with our new executive team,neg,train
"Let me now move on to our biosimilars business, which generate $122 million in revenue this quarter more than doubling year-over-year",neg,train
"Full year biosimilar revenues were $380 million, growing nearly fourfold versus 2016",neg,train
"We anticipate that increased biosimilar competition will result in further price erosion, but we still expect double-digit increases in revenue in 2018",neg,train
"Turning to our anti-CD20 revenues, we recorded $415 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 31% versus prior year primarily driven by the OCREVUS royalties",neg,train
Within anti-CD20 revenues our estimate OCREVUS royalties were $77 million for the fourth quarter and $159 million for the full year,neg,train
"Although we do expect OCREVUS royalty continue to grow, we anticipate total anti-CD20 revenue growth to slow in 2018 versus what we saw in 2017 driven by the anniversarying on the OCREVUS launch in the second quarter of 2018 and the full year impact of a lower profit share percentage for RITUXAN",neg,train
"new patient adds, it seems that in 4Q added 420 patients, it’s a step down from 3Q",neg,train
I was wondering is it because of our seasonality you expected to go back to let’s say 500 per quarter level or what’s the outlook for 2018 new patients out in the U,neg,train
"Before I conclude, I would also like to note that starting with the Q1 2018 earnings call we will post press releases related to future earnings calls materials and investor events on the Investors section of Biogen’s website, www",neg,test
com and issue statement on Twitter when they become available,neg,train
"We will do this instead of publishing press releases related to future earnings calls, earnings releases and Investor events via Newswire services",neg,train
So we were pleased with the performance in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Maybe just a follow-up on your gene therapy, Mike, you talked about some of the differentiated features, but are you willing at this point to give us anymore details with respect to either the vector you guys are using or the route of delivery and how you are thinking about initial trial designs? Thanks",neg,train
"What I say would be I think we laid out for the investor community at the JPMorgan Conference an illustrative view of how much capacity we have from a capital perspective and that concluded both cash on hand at the end of the second, third quarter rather leverage taking the leverage of the company up to 2x less the leverage we have today plus cash flow for the next 5 years",neg,train
"And if you put all those factors together, I am assuming a flat business, which we obviously don’t expect",neg,train
"We get a $37 billion number, which gives us a lot of capacity to add to the business",neg,train
"So, from a price perspective, I think the people are aware, I will talk to the U",neg,train
"first that we took prices up about, little bit more than 8%, some products a little bit less than that in others",neg,train
"So, we expect to get kind of some price drop through",neg,train
We do expect as we commented the gross to net or discounts in a while just to go up,neg,train
"So, we won’t probably fall through as much as we had historically, but we will still get some kind of pricing increases",neg,train
Volume will be a little bit pressured in the first half of the year as we complete the anniversarying of the OCREVUS launch after which in the second half volume will come back a little bit more,neg,train
"So, that’s a little bit with regard to the U",neg,train
"We will have kind of OCREVUS coming in across some of the countries slowly, so there will be a little bit of a headwind",neg,train
We still expect to grow and then price will maybe be down a little bit across Europe,neg,train
"So, that kind of if you put all that together you get to kind of the low single-digit kind of contraction of the business",neg,train
And then the factor we have of course is the interferon class is continuing to get again some headwind as a result of people moving away from that class a bit and we are doing our best to kind of stem that,neg,test
"As Michelle highlighted, we added seven new clinical stage assets in 2017, through both advancing internal candidates, and through external business development",neg,train
"And as you may have seen earlier today, we announced our first deal of the year, in this agreement we acquired the rights to Karyopharm’s first-in-class Phase 1 ready investigational oral compound KPT-350 for certain neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, primarily focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS",neg,train
"KPT-350 is a novel candidate that works by inhibiting XPO1, with the goal of reducing inflammation and neurotoxicity along with the increasing neuro protective responses",neg,train
We plan on moving this asset into a Phase 1 study by the end of the year,neg,train
Q4 gross margin was 85% which was negatively impacted by the disproportionate increase in contract manufacturing of biosimilars as well as a write-off of approximately $20 million of ZINBRYTA assets including inventory,neg,train
"Full year gross margin was 87%, slightly lower than in 2016",neg,test
Q4 R&D expense was 18% of revenue or $588 million,neg,train
This included $78 million of expense related to Alkermes and $25 million with Ionis due to recently announced business development transactions,neg,train
"As expected, we are seeing an increasing contribution from maintenance doses as patients who started earlier in the year transitioned to dosing once every 4 months on a chronic basis",neg,train
", approximately 25% of SPINRAZA revenues in the fourth quarter were attributed to maintenance doses as compared to 10% in the third quarter",neg,train
This correlates with the continued decline in the average doses per patient from 1,neg,test
5 from the third quarter to the fourth quarter this year,neg,train
We expect this dynamic to normalize over time with approximately 50% revenue being driven by maintenance doses by the end of 2018,neg,train
"Biogen closed 2017, with an all-time high in quarterly revenues of $3",neg,train
"For the full year 2017, Biogen generated another all-time high of $12",neg,train
"On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding hemophilia, full year revenues grew 15% versus 2016",neg,train
Full year revenues grew 7% when we include hemophilia for 2016 and January 2017,neg,train
Let me now turn to our full year guidance for 2018,neg,train
7 billion to $13 billion which would represent year-over-year growth of 3,neg,train
We expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales to be consistent with our full-year 2017 cost of goods sold,neg,train
We anticipate R&D expense between 16% and 17% of sales,neg,train
We expect SG&A expense to be approximately 15% to 16% of revenues,neg,train
"From a tax perspective, our guidance takes into account the impact of U",neg,train
tax reform and we anticipate our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be between 23,neg,train
5% and our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 22,neg,train
We anticipate full year 2018 GAAP EPS results of $22,neg,train
20 representing growth of 83% to 91% and non-GAAP EPS to be between $24,neg,train
From a quarterly perspective we expect non-GAAP EPS growth on year-over-year basis to be stronger in Q2 ‘18 and Q4 ‘18 due to the impact of business development events in 2017 and the factors described above,neg,train
We believe the midpoint of the guidance ranges we have provided represents a reasonable base case,neg,train
"Along with our partner, Ionis, we were awarded the prestigious 2017 Prix Galien USA award for Best Biotechnology Product for SPINRAZA",neg,train
This award recognizes extraordinary achievement in scientific innovation that improves the state of human health and we are honored to have received this distinction,neg,train
"In November, the end of study results from ENDEAR, the Phase 3 study of SPINRAZA were published in the New England Journal of Medicine",neg,train
The ENDEAR study highlights the therapeutic potential of this breakthrough treatment as most infants receiving SPINRAZA showed meaningful benefit regardless of their age or stage of the disease,neg,train
We provided clarity on Biogen strategic priorities with the aim of becoming the leader in neuroscience,neg,train
"To that end, we made significant progress in 2017 towards this vision",neg,train
"We made noteworthy advancements transitioning pipeline candidates from research to development with five transitions in 2017, nearly double Biogen’s historical productivity",neg,train
"Total other revenues were $180 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $129 million versus $51 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by greater contract manufacturing",neg,train
"Other revenues were $360 million for the full year, a 14% increase versus 2016",neg,train
"In 2018, we continue – we expect continued growth in contract manufacturing similar to the growth in full year 2017 but the exact amounts maybe lumpy over the quarters",neg,train
"I am just on the SPINRAZA discounting and allowances I think that you called out, just doing some quick math on the patients and the dose per patient – doses per patient that you guys callout in your numbers",neg,train
I don’t really see a step down in the – essentially in the revenue per dose quarter-on-quarter,neg,test
Can you maybe sort of square that a little bit and talk about what’s really going on with respect to discounting allowances? Thanks,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies,neg,train
"I think aspirationally, we look to say how do we get more of our services more common across all markets",neg,train
If there's good opportunity to do that then we'll look at it,neg,train
I think with broadband that tends to be more difficult,neg,train
So if we felt that the right opportunity came up we'd be open to,neg,train
"We continue to obtain a positive contribution from our investments in joint ventures, enjoy a low average cost of debt at just 2",neg,train
"These results have once again delivered a strong return for shareholders, due to combination of increased earnings and a progressive dividend",neg,train
"313 of EPS, maintaining our long range trend of double digit earnings growth and we have declared an interim dividend of GBP0",neg,train
"1306 per share, again continuing growth, which has seen dividends almost double over the last 10 years",neg,train
"Now this increased investment appears directly on screen, from sets to wardrobe, special-effects, the writing and of course the on-screen talent, we are working with",neg,train
But investing in the Sky Originals brings a number of other benefits to the business,neg,train
"It gives us more security of supply, it allows us to strike better deals with rights holders and enables us to participate in the growing demand for high quality content",neg,train
"Sky Q also provides the platform for the launch of Sky without the need for a satellite dish, first in Italy in April, then in Austria",neg,train
"We got strong setup plans for our streaming business, with a host of improvements we're bringing to customers this year, including download functionality and HD packages",neg,test
"So to conclude, I think these results show, we are executing our financial model well",neg,train
"We posted good revenue growth and we're doing a good job on cost, growing profit and earnings and returns to shareholders, and we are on track to achieve our plans",neg,train
"And we'll deliver enhanced content lineup, including more Sky Originals bringing X Factor into Pay TV and leverage recent deals we've made in movies and sports with things like Champion's League",neg,test
"That's very helpful color, if I could just follow-up quickly on the sort of the infrastructure technology platform side, is that all owned and operated by Sky? And it sounds like you can scale that to many more markets, if I am hearing you right, I was just curious, if that's a significant additional cost ahead of the company, if you were to take that into a larger footprint?",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"We broadly deprecate it from particular proprietary systems, and most of that is developed in-house",neg,train
Albeit we work with a range of partners and clearly we support at the consumer end we will support now a very broad range of devices,neg,train
"The first place you can see this approach is in our financial performance, with revenues up by 5% and with good growth in all markets and all categories",neg,train
Our continued focus on efficiency meant that we reduced operating costs and this together with good revenue growth delivered a strong profit performance,neg,train
"You can also see it in customer's reaction to our services, which is very strong tribute [ph] to our performance on the screen, which has been good both in terms of viewing, up 6% in overall terms but also in the high points we've achieved with some of our new investments",neg,train
"For example, Riviera and Tin Star in the UK and Gomorrah in Italy were the most watched Sky Original Productions in those markets",neg,train
And Babylon Berlin our first major original drama in Germany has been nominated for 9 National TV Awards and done very well,neg,train
"So to your point about an offer lapsing, last time, this last remaining hurdle because there were two previously with the CMA, was in that case successfully overcome",neg,train
"Program sales grew by GBP37 million, driven by international sales of Britannia, Riviera and Tin Star as well as Great British Bake Off in the UK",neg,train
"Alongside that, our channel sales were up 7% and that came from more premium subscribers on Virgin and TalkTalk, rate increases in our supply agreements and a new agreement to supply our German channels in Switzerland",neg,train
Let me [ph] conclude by talking a bit about some of the investments for future growth that we're making,neg,train
"We launched Sky Mobile a year ago, we had a good start, adding around 335,000 customers",neg,train
"In the most recent quarter we've taken a - just under a 10% share of the UK market sales and we got strong setup plans for further growth, including amongst other thing the launched of our tablet and accessory propositions",neg,train
I would now like to hand the call back to Jeremy Darroch for any closing remarks,neg,train
"So in total, our business performed well across the first half",neg,train
It delivered a strong financial performance and we're making good progress in the areas that matter,neg,train
2018 we will grow our investments in Sky Originals and particularly move to an always-on experience with customers,neg,train
"We'll have on one Sky Original every week on average, including at least 10 big dramas across the year and 22 returning franchises",neg,train
"Alongside ramping up the volume, we're also focused on step changing the quality and scale of what we produce",neg,train
Our most recent success in Drama Britannia is a good example of this,neg,train
"It will be our biggest drama production to-date, at a gross level pre-worldwide sales, that will cost something like GBP37 million, 270% [ph] higher than we were investing three years ago on a similar production",neg,train
"Look, I think there is a couple of levels within that",neg,test
"So one of the things we've talked about today was the internal migration of a number of different platforms and systems, each of which are delivering OTT in our current markets and migrating all of those onto a single platform",neg,train
And then before the end of calendar 2018 all of those markets with Spain being the last will be running off a single core backbone and a single set of platform assets,neg,train
And normally if an offer is dropped there's a six month waiting period before another offer can be made,neg,train
What are your thoughts on offering your own full broadband service in other countries like you have in the UK? Thank you,neg,train
"So the opportunity is there, we got a pretty full program of work in 2018, to round out the work we've been doing on our capability and then we'll see how we trade in Switzerland and Spain alongside that",neg,train
"2 billion, leverage was flat, at just over three-times EBITDA and we maintain our medium-term target of two times",neg,train
"So in summary I am delighted with our strong performance, not just in this half year but sustained now over time, particularly when consumer markets have not always been easy across our territories",neg,train
At the heart of that remains our relentless focus on providing customers with more value for money and choice versus other entertainment options,neg,train
"We'll implement a major UI user enterprise update across all services, and it's going to transform the viewing experience for each one of our customers",neg,train
And make it easier for them to access content and provide more value for money,neg,test
I would now like to hand the call over to Mr,neg,train
"I know you can't say too much on the takeover, but I was worried about a couple of questions on how the fundaments of it work",neg,train
"Currently the CMA has pushed the decision back to 1st of May from the 6th of March, as it seeks additional feedback",neg,train
Can it keep pushing that date back until a definitive regulatory ruling is made on the Disney's offer to buy Fox?,neg,train
"For either Andrew or Jeremy, I'm just curious if you could expand a little bit more on your OTT plans kind of pan Europe",neg,train
But you talked about bringing all of the markets under a single platform,neg,train
"Could you just give us a little more color on what that entails, how far along you are to the extent you're partnering with sort of major third parties, would love to hear that piece",neg,train
"And maybe a similar question for you on the right side, as you think about kind of a three year or four year outlook, how much more rights acquisition do you think you need to make in order to have the product you want to offer across the continent on an OTT basis?",neg,train
First of all we signed a new agreement with Warner Brothers in the UK and Germany,neg,test
"Warmers are a strong partner bringing a slate of top titles, and iconic franchises, including Harry Potter, Batman and the Lego movies",neg,train
And secondly we're taking Formula One exclusively in Italy the home of Ferrari,neg,train
"Now this mirrors what we've done in the UK, and together with Moto GP is a major addition to an extremely strong sports offering over there",neg,train
So in summary it's been a strong first half of the year,neg,test
We are delivering excellent results I think and sustain operational and financial performance,neg,train
"In the UK and Ireland, we grew revenues by 4%, driven by good growth in customers and in particular by up selling products like Sky Q, fiber and mobile",neg,train
"And growth would have been higher in the UK, but for a subdued television advertising market",neg,test
Our revenue growth in Italy was towards top of our range of 4% benefitting from a price rise and improved mix of premium subscribers and higher advertising revenues,neg,train
"And I was pleased with 8% growth in Germany, which is driven by a larger customer base, slightly lower discounting, improved product penetration and again strong growth in advertising",neg,train
The CMA as a point of process is allowed to seek one eight week extension,neg,train
"But then have to use the whole of the eight weeks, but the process makes provision for only one",neg,train
"So to answer to your question more directly, no, there cannot be another extension by the CMA",neg,train
"Obviously once that goes to the Secretary of State, they then have a certain period of time to make a decision and the possibility of consulting on that decision",neg,train
We got another strong set of plans for 2018 which we believe we'll keep delivering both in the short and long-term for customers and shareholders alike,neg,train
We'll go next to Dennis Swanberg [ph] with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"So as we move on to questions, let me just remind you that we're currently constrained by the takeover court and so we hope you will understand if we can't answer all of your questions",neg,train
"And with that, I'll hand you back to the operator and we'll get going",neg,test
"I think by now most of you will be familiar with our financial model, has [ph] started good revenue growth and this combined with driving hard on costs provides us the capacity to invest on screen as well as to grow profits",neg,train
In November we launched Sky Q in Italy and we're also launching Sky Q in Germany and Austria in the next six months,neg,train
"And before I get into our plans for 2018, I just wanted to remind you, at the highest level what we're trying to do",neg,train
"Our mission at Sky, so to speak is actually pretty simple",neg,train
"We think our job's to keep bringing our customers at about [ph] our content, by renovation and then to better connect them to more of what they love",neg,train
"So in terms of the agenda of the call, what we will do, I'll take you through the top line results and some highlights from the year so far",neg,train
Andrew is then going to talk about the detail of our financial performance,neg,train
And then I'll come back and outline some of our priorities in 2018 before we take and questions,neg,train
"Thank you, and thanks everybody for joining the call today",neg,test
"As you've seen it's been a good start for the year, good first six months of the financial year",neg,test
"So with that we look forward to speaking to you again relatively soon, and thank you very much",neg,test
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Allan Nichols with Morningstar,neg,train

"In terms of whether once an offer lapses by a company that's made an offer, whether Disney would be locked out of the market, I can't answer definitively that - it's a quite technical question",neg,train
"The UK Takeover Panel would be the arbitrator of that and that's the determination that I'm not adding [ph] anything that's been made, that's actually been directly made",neg,train
"So I wouldn't say it's an additional expense, it's an efficiency and to an extent that we're using the same engineering resource to do more with the same money rather than replicate the same thing",neg,train
Cutting this by business lines shows a strong picture too,neg,train
Our largest direct-to-consumer business grew by 3% adding the equivalent of GBP400 million of annualized revenue,neg,train
Alongside this sat two faster growing areas of advertising and content revenues,neg,train
"We outperformed the advertising market in each of our territories and our standout performance was in Germany, with our revenues up by 25% on the back of a successful strategy of higher prices for our valuable live sports inventory, increased viewing to our channels and good growth from our client direct business",neg,train

We now have almost 23 million customers taking 62 million products across Europe,neg,train
"Over the last five years as we turned our attention to more broadly-based growth, our total product base has grown by some 20 million so around 50%",neg,train
"And bringing all these together, EBITDA grew 10%, with 80 basis points of margin expansion, operating profit exceeded three quarters of a billion pound, representing 11% growth on last year",neg,test
"We have that platform, and as we go through the job of work for 2018 we will increasingly be able to make that platform work at scale and potentially have some redundant capacity within it",neg,train
"And then in customer service, we are going to continue to transition the business from being primarily voice contact only service delivery to more efficient digital channels, whilst continuing to set in the pace in our industry",neg,train
"So we got a big year ahead of us, for example movies [ph] in artificial intelligent that recognize our messages that customer see and help them fix them, we are trying augmented reality to assist with in-home broadband diagnostics",neg,train
We're executing well against our financial model with good revenue growth and an excellent performance on operating costs,neg,train
"That growth's been across the board, with revenue up 5%, reported EBITDA up 10% and earnings per share growth of 11%",neg,train
And that continues a consistent track record where we've delivered good revenue growth in each year and almost a GBP1 billion of EBITDA since 2010,neg,test

"With this in mind, let me just give you a few highlights now on 2018 from our presentation, this morning, and I will start with content",neg,train
"We grew very strongly, ahead on screen on five [ph], I think we are in the strongest position we've ever been in, in terms of our overall content portfolio",neg,train
"Within that Sky Original productions are a key focus for us, because we know that high quality and distinctive local content delivered well is an important part of the proposition",neg,train
"It complements our line-up of the best content from around the world, we showed like Game of Thrones and Billions are the top Hollywood movies",neg,train
"As an example Sky Q which we think is the best TV experience anywhere in the world, it launched in the UK, two years ago, and we am very pleased with his progress",neg,train
There are now over 2 million households taking the service and it's delivering a number of benefits,neg,train
"On average, customers are watching more on demand content which gives them more value and consequently churn is lower",neg,train
And ARPU for Sky Q customers is higher from by take up of multi-screen and more Sky store purchases,neg,test
"And then the final thing, you'd need is a set of content rights",neg,train
Italy performed well and that was due to a strong increase in viewing,neg,train
"And in a UK market, that we estimated declined slightly for the first half we delivered good growth with AdSmart and digital advertising",neg,train
Content revenues delivered our highest rate of growth and an excellent example of how we benefit from the growth in the overall video category not just in our own platform business,neg,train
I'll now hand over to Andrew to talk you through the detail of the financial performance,neg,train
And finally our frontline service delivery continues to lead the way,neg,train
And we achieve this by managing scale and complexity well,neg,train
So operational performance is strong in the Christmas quarter and on top of this we've completed the rollout of new sports and entertainment packaging and accelerated the implementation of significant loyalty programs,neg,test
"There's nothing baked into that today, we have got some road ahead of us in terms of getting those two markets to work in scale",neg,train
"But if you strip it back and say what would the potential ingredients of success, if you were to go into other markets within the European continent, and look for a brand, which we obviously have, you look for a multi-capability core platform, able to do transactional services, linear services as well as [indiscernible] services and to do those both behind a payroll and potentially on a transactional basis",neg,train
"Consistent theme in our financial performance was our ability to tightly manage operating costs, and we've held our SG&A costs, flat in absolute terms for three years now",neg,train
That means they have fallen as a percentage of sales from 40% down to 34% over the last five years,neg,train
"One of the key things on cost with the transition to a single Sky and this quarter marked the three year milestone, since we first brought the three Skies together",neg,train
But perhaps more importantly we're now bringing all of our territories on to one common OTT platform,neg,train
"Look I think, so we continue to see good demand for our software from owner operators, I mean refiners and chemical producer are actually enjoying a very good macroeconomic environment and expectation is that the U",neg,train
"refiners are going to have a very strong year, this year chemical producers as well in general",neg,train
So I think the demand from this customers is positive,neg,train
"Taken together, we are updating our GAAP operating income guidance to a range of $204 million to $209 million for fiscal 2018 with GAAP net income of approximately $140 million to $143 million",neg,train
We now expect GAAP net income per share to be in a range of $1,neg,train
"Yes so now I mean, when you look at Q3 you have to remember we are losing two days as compared to Q2",neg,train
"So when you look at Q3, you are going to lose little over a million and a quarter per day",neg,train
5 a kind of accelerated revenue from second half of the year,neg,train
5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $56,neg,train
52 per share compared to net income of $37 million or $0,neg,train
48 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017,neg,train
Annual spend which is a proxy for the annualized value of our recurring term license and maintenance business at the end of each period was approximately $469 million at the end of second quarter,neg,train
"Your next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities, your line is open",neg,train
"Antonio first, you have talked about annual spend this year is back, a key to growth is 4",neg,test
2% lower than yearly growth target of 5% to 7%,neg,train
May be could you talk about the confidence level you have that annual spend growth fix up in back half,neg,train
"Hey hi guys, this is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling",neg,train
So your tax rate is going to go down significantly in FY '19 it would be like 21% versus 28% to 29% that you estimate for this fiscal year,neg,train
"Just wondering how would you prioritize investments versus capital return to shareholders, and investments particularly would you be driving it towards APM suite",neg,test
The introduction of Aspen Mtell will mitigate unplanned pump failures and sharing continues operations and production volumes,neg,train
"The plan is to rollout the technology over the next 12 months to manage the unplanned stoppages by using the failure pattern technology in the context of production schedules, therefore allowing continues plant availability",neg,test
Cirus expects to achieve savings from this initiative which is part of an important digitalization project,neg,train
"These customers also are user of our engineering and [indiscernible] products, licensing of the APN suite extends our relationship and further prove the value creation potential from AspenTech’s products",neg,train
"So I guess what I wanted to hit on was the guidance on expenses for the back half of the year, Karl",neg,test
It sort of implies a fairly drop off in operating margin for the back half both sequentially from the first half and then relative to the year over year compares so just sort of wondering what assumptions are in those numbers they are back half hiring or some other investments that we should be thinking about that sort of driving the back half margin lower than the first half of the fiscal year,neg,train
"Before I wrap up, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the recently passed tax reform legislation",neg,train
Aspen Tech is a significant beneficiary of corporate tax reform due to our practice of maintaining our intellectual property in the United States,neg,train
We intend to use additional cash flow from our lower tax rate to support our existing capital allocation priorities,neg,test
"Well look in addition to signing up the foreigners we have been working hard to enable them through training, education and so on",neg,train
I would expect that certainly that'll be part of the sales cycle here,neg,train
"We said in the past that the APM sales cycle tends to be like the MSC sales cycle, nine to 12 months so any impact from the GIs we would expect to start seeing is perhaps towards the latter part of fiscal 2019",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair, your line is open",neg,test
"Let me first say, in general construction Company in addition to the signing and building this plant",neg,train
They also provide consulting and do studies for this owners operators,neg,train
59 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 based on 73 million shares outstanding and was above the high end of our guidance range of $0,neg,train
52per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 based on 77,neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of David Hynes from Canaccord,neg,train
"What I would say that our accretion as a result of down turn in oil prices under [indiscernible] topics or attrition jumped from 2% to 3% to 5% to 6% that three points of growth that we have to overcome every year, every quarter",neg,train
"And if as you say, you play forward and you do, you get through a full cycle where you reset every contract, you could see our growth rate getting into that high single-digit, double-digit growth",neg,test
So that’s that give us confidence that the pipeline is also of good quality,neg,test
"Yes so, I will start with the back end first",neg,train
"So, the tax rate changed on December 29, 30, whenever it was signed into law",neg,train
"So, you get the first half of fiscal year, is that 35% rate, and then the second half is at the 21, so you have to take an average and then what you do is you adjust Q2, Q3 and Q4 to get to that average",neg,train
"Third, this global metals and mining Company licensed our Mtell product to address a key challenge with process pump failures in its European plant, which costs approximately $200,000 per failure",neg,train
These failures are severe detriment to the Company’s operations often causing total shutdowns,neg,train
"Also, please note that the following information is related to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, January 24, 2018",neg,train
"Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information",neg,train
In summary AspenTech delivered solid results across the board and we are pleased with the Company's performance in the first half of fiscal 2018,neg,train
This new solution combines IT dynamics with the technology we acquired from in process technology and consulting group,neg,train
We believe operators can achieve savings from operating training team relation of up to $15 million per project,neg,test
And I think the key word is predictive maintenance of key words,neg,train
"From a regional standpoint, Europe, Russia and North America delivered notable performances",neg,train
"As it relates to fiscal 2018, we expect a 27% to 28% effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarter, which will lead to an effective tax rate of 28% to 29% for the full fiscal year 2018",neg,train
"We currently expect an effective tax rate of 21% beginning in fiscal 2019 and for fiscal periods thereafter, but as I mentioned, we are still evaluating new deductions in the legislation that could reduce this effective tax rate",neg,train
But we will take it one fiscal year at a time here,neg,train
"So we now that we signed some deals we are getting feedback from customers about how they our technology compared to that of others, the advantages that they see",neg,train
"With that, let me turn the call over to Karl",neg,train
"In the second quarter we repurchased 756,000 shares for approximately $50 million, it is our current intention to continue our buyback at the $50 million per quarter level for the remainder of fiscal 2018",neg,train
"In addition, we have expanded our partner eco system to over 50 resellers, system implementers and OEM's which resale and deploy the APM suite in the GEI industries",neg,train
The proof point achieved during the second quarter coupled with a growth in our APM pipeline and number of pilot committed validate our investment in the APM suite and support the return we are expecting from it,neg,test
"The recent increase in oil prices back above $60 per barrel has the potential to be a positive for spending going forward, however there are a few things to keep in mind",neg,train
"If you were to take attrition back to a normal level of 3%, then you are in sort of 8% range we are banking with APM as 389 and new source of growth and delivering that extra 2% to 3% that gets us to double-digit",neg,test
"Alright thank you and just one more if I could sneak in, it's going to be quick",neg,train
"You mentioned there was a cash collection based revenue in the quarter, how much amount was it and how much of a tailwind did you have on the revenue",neg,train
We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter and through the first half of fiscal 2018,neg,train
"We believe we are positioned to achieve our annual spend growth guidance of 5% to 7% for the fiscal year, supported by solid performance in all three product suites",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird Company,neg,train
"So we are not like I said in my talk, I don’t think we expect a significant or an acceleration of that business on that side",neg,train
"Other companies like national oil companies are not discussing CapEx budget increases, there country focus and strengthening their physical budgets",neg,train
"Yes, so, what you end up with sometimes is when the effective rate, cash tax rate as you get some timing differences related to primary and temporary differences, good example will be deferred revenue can cause a difference between the two",neg,train
"So by and large overtime they should aligned but in any year any quarter you can get a little bit of departure, but I wouldn’t say it’s by 200 or 300 basis points",neg,test
"Well I mean look, this is whole, this is a market segment, it’s not only that can take, new suite the fact is there isn’t any references in the industry for machine learning analytics, so in a way we are creating a new market, we are working on establishing the proof points and references which I believe we made good progress in that regard in Q2, but we also have to [indiscernible], we have to achieve that critical mass of customers that eventually would get across the - and the inflection point where it becomes more of a mass adoption",neg,train
"9 million for the second quarter, above the high end of our guidance range, an increase of 4",neg,train
The over performance in the quarter is largely driven by the recognition of cash basis revenue,neg,train
Your next question is coming from the line of Monika Garg from KeyBanc,neg,train
"We signed APM transactions across industries, products and geographies including significant transactions with refining and E&C customers for our Mtell and Fidelis products respectively",neg,train
With that I will now hand it back over to the operator to begin Q&A,neg,train
"Turning to our APM business, we delivered a solid quarter that reflects the market traction and increased customer spend that we expected to see in the quarter",neg,train
"We saw a meaningful quarter-over-quarter increase in annual spend from APM transactions signed during the second quarter, which brings the first half of fiscal year 2018 performance in line with our expected trajectory",neg,train
An updated manufacturing execution system that simplifies migration from process floor to AspenONE processes floor as well as enabling users to track operating APIs in real time from any device and finally the official introduction of Aspen ProMV to the AspenONE APN suite which delivers high fidelity control and improves the quality and consistency of batch processing by managing the sources of variability introduction operation,neg,train
Cipher is a cloud native approximately with multitenant capabilities leveraging a modern architecture design based on Microsoft Azure Internet Of Things platform which can also be used on premise,neg,train
The business environment for our E&C customers remains flat with signs of nascent increase in activities in most parts of the world except for North America and Southeast Asia where the business remains challenged,neg,train
"As a reminder, the business environment in the quarter was still driven by the calendar year 2017 outlook informed during the difficult oil price environment of late 2016",neg,train
2 million which represent a non-GAAP operating margin of 49,neg,train
"2 million and we returned $50 million to shareholders by repurchasing 756,000 shares",neg,train
This transaction also help to address the token overhang in the customers engineering suite due to the global macro environment for E&C companies helping to mitigate a potential reduction in spend,neg,train
"Well I mean look it's like, I think it's what we said to investors when we meet with them and also in previous calls",neg,test
Certainly organic investments internally in the Company whether it’s R&D or go to market functions then M&A and then share purchases,neg,train
"My name is Rose, and I will be your conference operator for today",neg,train
"At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call",neg,train
"All lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise",neg,train
"After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session",neg,train
Our fiscal 2018 cash flow guidance – free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately $55 million to $60 million,neg,train
From a timing perspective we are required to pay 50% of our expedited cash taxes in the second quarter with the remaining 50% paid equally in the third and fourth quarter,neg,train
"I want to ask you guys, on the quarter relative to annual spent, did manufacturing drive extend a majority of that if you could say or just more qualitatively is that still back on-track after deposit spot in Q3, fiscal 2017",neg,train
"And just to put out together, that back half of my question is about the engineering, is the hurricane helping that, could you just see it helped that at all or could it help somewhat in the second half and now you are anticipating that at all",neg,train
In Q2 our quarterly tax payment was due before the new legislation was passed and based on a previous effective tax rate of 34%,neg,train
"As a result, we have already paid more than 50% of our anticipated full-year cash taxes",neg,train
7 million in cash and marketable securities compared to $59 million at the end of last quarter,neg,train
"During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $756,000 shares of our stocks or $50 million",neg,train
We remain on-track to repurchase $200 million of stock in fiscal 2018,neg,train
"A noticeable trend with our Tier-1 E&C customers is a focus on creating new sources of revenue around services offerings for their customers, whether that is through operations and maintenance services or implementation and monitoring services for their customers' operations",neg,train
"And then you know oil markets, you also talk about have defiantly improve recently",neg,train
Have you seen increased interest from your customers to buy more software or any commentary from the customer you can share,neg,train
Karl Johnsen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
"During the quarter, we also acquired the Cipher industrial Internet Of Things software and edge connectivity assets of Architect Software",neg,train
Cipher extends and expands our asset optimization strategy by providing sophisticated cloud and edge computing technology that captures and aggregates critical data from assets to other plants and across the enterprise,neg,train
I would now like to close with our third quarter guidance and updated outlook for the full-year fiscal 2018,neg,train
"For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $120 million to $122 million",neg,train
Non-GAAP operating income of $52 million to $54 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0,neg,train
"On a GAAP basis, we expect operating income of $46 million to $48 million and income per share of $0",neg,test
8 million in the quarter with a gross margin of 90,neg,train
"Looking at revenue by line item, subscription software revenue was $117",neg,train
"7 million for the second quarter, an increase of a $112",neg,train
"2 million compared to $7 million in the year-ago period, an $7 million last quarter",neg,train
"So nice to hear the APM traction in the comments, one other things that jumped out to me was, you talking about E&C's as prospective customers on that front",neg,train
I was thinking about his more as a play on kind of leveraging historic operating data,neg,train
"So does E&Cs have this - other different use case and how the refiners use it, just may be talk about selling APM into the end season, exactly how that works",neg,train
"Before I turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A, I would like to let you know that we will be shifting the timing of our annual Investor Day to the second half of the calendar year",neg,train
"Let me answer the second part of your question on the hurricane, no we saw no benefit from that, and the fact is there are very few of those plants were impacted, so and there is no benefit expected in the future",neg,train
"Your next question comes from the line Sterling Auty from JPMorgan, your line is open",neg,train
"Got it just one more question on that, is that a potential inflection point you see for the APM suite or is it a steady growth or fiscal 2018, 2019 many onwards",neg,train
"Turning to the full-year, we are raising our revenue guidance in the range of $490 million to $495 million and continue to expect subscription and software to comprise greater than 90% of revenue with our services and other revenue representing the remainder",neg,train
"Turning to our second quarter performance in more detail, energy and general construction and chemicals once again represents a greater than 90% of our business, energy was a largest vertical contributor followed by chemicals and E&C",neg,train
"That make sense, I will sneak one more just to keep counter parts",neg,test
"So we are three and half years kind remove from the major 2014 recent R&D market, we know you sign five to six year deals, so that there is still in series as period of challenging goals as you work to the base",neg,train
"I'm asking your crystal ball out, if we fast forward past these renewals headwinds, right may be two to three years and everyone's got now buying against recent expectations does it feel like Aspen can get back to a 10% annual spend grower at some point",neg,train
To summarize Aspen Tech delivers solid second quarter results and we believe we are positioned to achieve our full-year growth and profitability target,neg,test
Following with our representative sample of transactions closed in the quarter,neg,test
"And look at our MSC business is performing well and we would expect, I would expect it to perform in line with our there historical performance of the past six, seven years out of that area of double-digit growth",neg,train
"Fourth, this long-term European customer, a producer of polymers and agrochemicals, considers AspenTech a strategic IT supplier",neg,train
"The transaction of sand in the second quarter involves the upgrade an expansion of our manufacturing execution system products, expansion of our advanced process control technology to agrochemicals and expansion of our Aspen process sequencer product into two more polymer plants to manage and optimize the transition in this plant between different polymer grade production runs",neg,train
This is all based on the significant value generated from the use of these products,neg,test
"It's mostly new you know, hopefully we can get into that expansion of transactions that we have already done now",neg,train
We are not anticipated in material improvement in the micro entomic environment for the E&C and upstream market segment in fiscal 2018,neg,train
"Okay, that makes sense and in terms of deals when you do go in and sign a deal like Azure, how does that compare to the overall deal sizes to your core business is it comparable deal size or is it kind of bigger or smaller",neg,train
"So you take those and you kind of roll from Q2, it make sense with the annual spend, and easier way to look at it, it’s just take the ending annual spend at the end of Q2, divided by 365 times the 90 days in Q3 and that gives me a good deal, what subscription would be plus or minus a little bit of cash basis and the timing of renewals or growth in the quarter, whether they materialize revenue in the quarter and the rest is just some variability around professional services",neg,train
"And lastly, this Canadian energy Company has been user of our Aspen planning product for over 50 years",neg,train
The Company decided to upgrade to our [indiscernible] technology after an extensive evaluation and migrated all users to the technology,neg,train
This transaction resulted in a significant increase in the number of tokens with plans for expanding using to all the related applications,neg,train
"Thanks, Karl, and thanks to everyone for joining us today",neg,train
"AspenTech delivered solid financial results, in our second quarter fiscal 2018, that continue to demonstrate good customer demand and execution across the Company",neg,train
First we have said in the past that oil prices are a proxy for energy companies CapEx investment which is the ultimate driver of work activity for E&C and upstream operators and hence spending with Aspen Tech,neg,train
"Hey guys, thanks for taking my question, how are you",neg,train
"So Antonio last couple of quarters, you have given a number around the pipeline and is that’s what represented by APM,I think that’s might come in Q&A, so I give you chance to touch on it as you ask for, but I think you said it was 19% a couple of quarters, so 21% this quarter",neg,train
"It seems like obviously your - you must be more broad based in demand with Fidelis kind of kicking in a little bit, maybe that number becomes less relevant, I just wondered if you wanted to touch on that quickly?",neg,train
There is a little bit of hiring in there and some other kind of investments but nothing that material compared to prior years with the hiring we had,neg,train
"And then if you kind of take that and look at the first half expenses inside Q3 and look at Q4, Q4 is pretty flat with the Q3 implied guidance that's in there",neg,train
So there is nothing spectacular in there it's actually just sort of the normal uptick you see in Q3 and then just kind of flat expenses through the year,neg,train
"And then from the margin point of view, you do have the decrease in revenue just because of the days",neg,train
"Well, I want to thank all of you, for joining the call today",neg,train
"Looking at our ten largest transactions in the quarter, we had a healthy mix of engineering, manufacturing supply chain and APM transactions, in fact two of the three largest transactions in the quarter were APM deals",neg,train

"Customers are recognizing the value that machine learning and analytics can have on improving their reliability, productivity and operating life of the physical components of their assets",neg,train
"just a last one here, for Q3 and Q4, did you say the tax it is around 28% or 29% and I guess if I heard it correctly than why would that be higher than like 21%?",neg,train
"There are no further questions at this time, presenters you may continue",neg,train
"Antonio will discuss business highlights from the second quarter, and then I will review our financial results and our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2018, before we open up the call for Q&A",neg,train
"Looking at our financial highlights for the quarter, annual spend was $469 million, up 4",neg,train
"9 million, above the high-end of our guidance range of $120 million to $122 million",neg,train
"Excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense, restructuring charges, amortization and intangible associated with acquisition, litigation judgment expense, acquisition related expense and non capitalized acquire technology, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of $62",neg,train
8% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $60,neg,train
4 million of cash from operations during the second quarter and $42,neg,test
"2 million of free cash flow, after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and non-capitalized acquired technology",neg,train
"A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in tables within our press release, which is also available on our website",neg,train
"Well, look like we said, two of the top three deals in the quarter were APM deals, we are you know we had an initial premise for the size of deals that we could do with these customers, some of these deals are competitive and of course you have that price pressure but even in that context we are satisfied the annual spend that we got for those deals",neg,train
So early indications are good but the you know the value creation for us but I would like to have a few more quarters under my belt before I can speak with total confidence about what is going to be possible,neg,train
"Q2 would have been slightly lower, but what happened was we had to revaluate our deferred tax assets because we put them on the books at the 34%, 35% rate and they are come up to 21% so got a little bit of a adjustment for that that drove the effective tax rate the quarter up",neg,train
But we did say for Q3 and Q4 somewhere in that 27% to 28% range and then for the full-year 28% to 29%,neg,train
This positive momentum supports our guidance of one to two points of annual spend growth from APM this fiscal 2018,neg,train
More importantly the quarter delivered the set of proof points validating our thesis that the products available in the APM suite represent a significant opportunity in both process and global economy industries,neg,train
"Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter",neg,train
"I have a question on the APM suite adoption, you gave a lot of examples on how it’s adopted across the industries, but can you help give us color on the mix of orders that you are receiving",neg,test
"How much of it is upstream, how much is downstream",neg,train
Can you give us some color on is it one particular industry vertical that’s going driver growth moving forward?,neg,test
I will now review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal year 2018 beginning with the annual spend and then finish with our third quarter guidance and updated outlook for fiscal 2018,neg,train
"Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter fiscal 2018 results, for the period ending December 31, 2017",neg,train
"I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call today is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO",neg,train
We have provided guidance for the fiscal year of one to two points that should represent a material number of customers that are adopting the technology,neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg,neg,train
We restated or reaffirmed our guidance for the year five to seven,neg,train
"We have good visibility into our pipeline of our business, both and in engineering and MSC side but also with APM suite and our conformation of the guidance I think demonstrates that we would expect faster growth to materializing Q3 and Q4",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Benchmark Company,neg,train
"Yes, well look certainly at the moment, we were 100% focused on standing up the APM suite and the products in the suite",neg,train
A great example of this was a key deal signed in the quarter with our APM suite that I will discuss in more detail later in the call,neg,train
"With respect to annual spend growth in fiscal 2018, we are maintaining our guidance of 5% to 7% annual spend growth",neg,train
"From a free cash flow perspective, we are increasing our fiscal year guidance of $190 million to $195 million versus our previous guidance of $180 million to $185 million",neg,train
"From an expense perspective, we are adjusting our assumption for total GAAP expenses to $284 million to $287 million, which compares to our previous guidance of approximately $282 million to $287 million",neg,train
And then your comment regarding the tax say for fiscal 2019,neg,test
So you said the tax rate could be 21% or could be lower depending upon when you look in details on the tax side,neg,train
"So, would the 21% be both for cash and non-GAAP tax rate?",neg,train
"Before moving on into our business outlook, I would like to take a moment to discuss the recent tax reform and what it means for AspenTech",neg,train
"As Antonio mentioned, we will significantly benefit from the new tax legislation",neg,train
We continue to evaluate the legislation and the impact it will have on our corporate tax rate,neg,train
"Just one question here, Antonio regarding your APM suite, competitively there is not much in a way of meaningful competition yet, mainly because it’s so early days of the category but for the few competitors that you do see out there or could be the defenders out there are trying to put an offering in the marketplace",neg,train
"There are obviously much different than your traditional competitors for MSC engineering products, if you just discuss a couple that the people that you do see or you do see about that our trying to put a protective maintenance product in the marketplace",neg,train
"There is being questions about whether that second wave could be sustained that was about a year ago but and now in the context of the macro environment the global economic growth environment in that, now you are seeing consistent growth across most developed economies",neg,train
I think the premium has shifted to one where the second wave of CapEx spending chemical will probably materialize in the U,neg,train
The Company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements,neg,test
"Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and in our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, which is now on file with the SEC",neg,train
"So Matt, it’s typical of that our model, the reason being if you look at the guidance we just gave you can figure out the implied guidance for the Q3 spend",neg,train
"And really what is going up $3 million, $4 million is really a benefit what you will see in there, you see that typically in our fiscal Q3 the first calendar year",neg,train
So if you look at that cap that down expense increase in Q3 compared to Q2 it predominantly benefits resetting so people are resetting the benefits where they kind of max them up from the year,neg,train
"With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio",neg,test
"Karl, then you know on the FQ3 revenue guidance, your revenue guidance for FQ3 is low than both for FQ2, FQ1",neg,train
"I guess trying to understand why would that be the case, are just conservatism on…",neg,train
"We expect to learn more in the near future as these companies announce their fiscal year plans, but we currently expect only modest overall growth from 2017 budgets that are still 40% to 50% below the peak levels seen several years ago",neg,test
"Looking at profitability in the quarter, we generated a 50% non-GAAP operating margin that was above our expectations",neg,test
1 include the new Aspen Operator training solution in the engineering suite which enables the seamless deployment of training for operators and engineers with a dynamic simulation life cycle solution that brings operator training simulation online sooner and sustains safety throughout an asset's lifetime,neg,train
We are pleased with the quality and expertise of employees we are bringing into the Company and how they are expanding our domain knowledge in our new areas of focus,neg,train
"And look we were satisfied with what we are hearing, certainly there is in the market, but I think the combination of these products with the expertise around the process industry and data certainly makes us strong contender",neg,train

"And I would assume these deals are competitive and just wondering, how much the software DNA that you guys have with certainly the installed based that you have plays a role I know you and your – mentioned in the prepared comments that take it on E&C deal that these guys are best about, that it was also help address token overhang",neg,train
"If these are competitive situations and we just our PTC come out and say that, their IOT business was better we think the software DNA that is helping them a lot",neg,train
"How much of a competitive advantages that for you guys right now, as you build that pipeline? Thanks a lot",neg,train

"When can we see higher growth in that three, thank you so much",neg,train
"Got it, and if you could add some color on the DEI, you added lot of partners and it seems like you are putting a lot of effort there",neg,train
"Looking to the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate a moderation of sales from current level but for the full year of 2018 we expect to realize mid-teens grown as we continue to benefit from our organic growth efforts together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions",neg,train
"So, in summary with respect to 2017, I am just extremely proud of our performance this year",neg,train
While there remain very dynamics in the global market the Amphenol organization has continued to execute extraordinarily well,neg,train
"In particular, our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in the company expanding our market positioning while strengthening our financial performance",neg,train
Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages,neg,train
"Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse market, a worldwide present, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and all of that with the underpinnings of our agile entrepreneurial management team",neg,train
"I think with the two acquisitions, they are obviously very different",neg,train
"And often times with the cable assembly business you are really looking for different customer channels, different markets, and different presence but at the same time they have fantastic manufacturing technology and really great high value component",neg,test
"I think with Sunpool, we are just really pleased that we get here not only in automotive antenna company, it's very, very important arguably the most important automotive market where the most cars are sold, sold and made",neg,train
But also a truly vertically integrated automotive antenna capability and that is additive to what we have had in the past,neg,train
You know that we've been developing organically our own automotive antenna business and we've been very successful with that,neg,train
"But I'd say this really give us a turbo boost in terms of our overall capabilities on automotive antennas from a design perspective of validation, assessing and all the kind of component of making those products, some of which we were able to do before and some of which we are only now able to do with the additional of Sunpool",neg,train
It relates to supply chain let say performance or a constraints on the other hand this affects you both I think from a sourcing perspective and also potential from the perspective of your customers and their inventory management,neg,train
I am wondering what you are seeing in this regard? Any sort of characterization of our current environment would help,neg,train
"During the quarter, the Company repurchased 700,000 shares at an average price of approximately $89",neg,test
These repurchases were made under the Company’s $1 billion two year stock repurchase program,neg,train
And approximately $318 million of repurchase remain available under the program through January 2019,neg,train
"Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future",neg,train
"No, I think we've just established ourselves in the IT market as really the leader in the high technology product for this market and so I think our team with their combination of truly advanced technologies whether that's in high speed and power and fiber optics or the other relevant technologies, together with the dynamics that I have described now here for several years of that quick ability to pivot towards where the new opportunities will be, I think that has given us a really great platform from which we can have this favorable view for the future",neg,test
"It's more of that growth coming from servers or storage or networking or cloud service, I don't know that I would break it down so specifically but I think the trends that we've seen over the recent two years, and we don't see a big change in those trends",neg,train
Operating margins were again strong in the quarter equaling our highest ever level of 20,neg,train
5% and cash flow in the quarter reached a new record $428 million which is just another a great confirmation of the company's financial strength,neg,train
We continued to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement,neg,train
"4% on an adjusted basis for the full year which represents the first full year over 20% level, as well as the achievement of 20",neg,train
5% operating margin in the fourth quarter which reflects a sixth consecutive quarter over 20%,neg,train
Our first question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research,neg,train
"Looking ahead for the first quarter, we expect sales to increase from current level and for the full year of 2018, we expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens in the automotive",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
This strong growth was supported by excellent operating performance as demonstrated by the company's strong operating margins,neg,train
I don't know maybe the word dour is too negative but your view on the mobile networks business seems that way to me,neg,train
Is there any geographic region that is more negative in 2018 versus 2017? Are you just seeing all global regions challenged?,neg,train
The Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $1,neg,train
944 billion exceeding the high end of the Company’s guidance for sales by approximately $145 million and achieving new records of performance,neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, the company delivered $1",neg,train
"432 billion in adjusted operating income, up strong 15% from 2016",neg,test
"So I think just on your -- reverse the question a little bit, both markets we would expect to be kind of high single digit organic growth for the year",neg,train
I would separate the two in terms of the dynamic in the industrial and the automotive market,neg,train
I think the industrial market certainly does not have some broad economic tailwind behind it,neg,train
Even if some of our performance in areas of that market are clearly are outperforming any trends that you see overall,neg,train
"Our strength in areas like heavy equipment and oil and gas, we are happy to have kind of rebounding at this point and things like instrumentation and medical, factory automation",neg,train
I think not all of those trends are just pure rising tide of GOP lift all the industrial boats kind of trend and if you look at something like factory automation I think here you have a trend that is beyond GDP which is really a shift in places like China and other low cost countries towards automation in order to deal with either lack of availability of labor which we see in many places or increasing cost of that same laboring,neg,train
Our products are used on a wide array of everything from robots to automation machine that go into this new factories and that's been a real favorable segment for us,neg,train
And not necessarily so much just an overall economic trend of automotive,neg,train
I mean you all know better than I do the general automotive number whether that flat or low single digit or whatever forecast would come,neg,train
So I'd say that less of a broad GDP economy trend and maybe industrial has a bit more of component of that,neg,train
The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2017,neg,train
Sales in the fourth quarter grew by a stronger than expected 29% in U,neg,train
"Sequentially, our sales in the industrial market grew by a better than expected 7%",neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3",neg,train
A very strong performance and compares to our adjusted EPS guidance in the full year at the high end of $3,neg,train
15 EPS benefit included in our guidance for the fourth quarter related to the expected excess tax benefit of stock option exercises,neg,train
"The mobile devices business obviously it looks like you gained significant shares, you are able to out execute your peers during the latter half of this year",neg,train
Are you seeing any expectation that you would see back some of that market share in 2018 or is your expectation that you would more follow kind of market growth of smartphones?,neg,train
"In addition to requiring the one-time charge just discussed, the Tax Act also reduces a substantial portion of the future tax benefits from our stock option program that we have called out during the prior 2017 earnings call",neg,train
"Because of these future tax benefits will be substantially reduced and the fact that 2017 was the first year that excess tax benefits were reflected in income under GAAP, we will exclude these benefits in our presentation of adjusted non-GAAP results for 2017 and onwards because we believe that it will provide a more helpful comparability of [period to period] [ph] results for investors",neg,train
Please refer to the supplemental financial information in our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP adjusted net income and the diluted EPS for all 2017 quarters which now excludes the excess tax benefits of stock option exercise as well as the other items already noted,neg,train
"Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels and for the full year of 2018, we currently expect sales in the broadband market to remain at 2017 level",neg,train
"As Craig mentioned in his remarks as a result of the changes in the US tax law, we currently expect the reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate of at least 100 basis points and we are going to continue to refine this expectation as further implementation guidance is released",neg,train
"On this base and based on continuation of the current market environment, as well as constant exchange rate, we now expect for the first quarter and full year 2018 the following results",neg,train
For the first quarter we expect sales in the range of $1,neg,train
820 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0,neg,train
And again that represents sales increase versus prior year of 14% to 17% in US dollars and 10% to 13% in local currency and an increase versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 13% to 16%,neg,train
"And anybody who is involved in actually building network, so whether that's mobile service providers, whether that's broadband service providers, whether that's a internet service providers, the cadence of when you build things is very different than if you are operating factories and you are paying for factory overhead and you want to kind of level low those factories over a certain time period",neg,train
I mean workers and construction project happen at a very different type of timing than do just factory consumption,neg,train
"Well, I think that is our final question and again we very much appreciate everybody's attention to us here",neg,train
And look forward to talking to you all here in three months and again Happy New Year and great continuation here in the first quarter,neg,train
"Looking into 2018, we now expect the slight moderation in sales from these levels in the first quarter and for the full year we expect the low single digit sales increase as helicopter and business jet procurement volume stabilize and as commercial jetliner production continues to grow moderately",neg,train
Speakers our last question from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen,neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, our sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 22% in U",neg,train
"And this is driven in particular by outstanding performance again in heavy equipment and instrumentation, oil and gas and also factory automation, as well as like contributions from the acquisitions that we've made over the recent two years",neg,train
Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in both fourth quarter of 2017 and for the full year of 2017,neg,train
"From an EPS perspective, on a GAAP basis including the impact of the Tax Act partially offset by the $0",neg,train
"21 full year excess tax benefit from stock option exercise, we reported diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter of $0",neg,train
On an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter -- fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0,neg,train
And compared to our adjusted EPS guidance in the fourth quarter at the high end of $0,neg,train
01 EPS benefit included in our guidance for the fourth quarter related to the expected excess tax benefit of stock option exercises,neg,train
So as you highlighted you create the 20% threshold pretty consistently recently,neg,train
"And given the volume outlook you providing, I was curious like how you would sort of quantify that chances of continuing to produce that type of level of margin if you are hitting those volumes",neg,train
Like what else would hold you back? Whether it's acquisition or raw materials or just seasonality as we think about modeling efforts here,neg,train
Our next question comes from line of Jim Suva from Citi,neg,train
"Well, I think to answer a little bit in reverse",neg,train
"But in terms of our position with our customers, I think we really confirmed to our customers that Amphenol is a very important partner to have and customers are not going to forget that very easily",neg,train
So I believe that we have really created for ourselves a very resilient position but resilient with the caveat that you are in a market where everything can change all the time,neg,test
And so I think we've done ourselves a great service,neg,train
We are very encouraged by the continued strong performance of Amphenol in 2017 and we look forward to driving further strength going forward even given the many dynamics across electronics industry,neg,test
"As indicated in earnings release, we are still evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our going forward effective tax rate",neg,train
As such based on the current information available we have estimated that the approximate benefit of the Tax Act on our tax rate will be at least one point,neg,train
Accordingly we have included this approximate benefit in our 2018 guidance,neg,train
We would like to note that the impact on our going forward effective tax rate are still be evaluated and the effective tax rate reflected in our guidance does not reflect any potential change due to the finalization in 2018 of the one-time tax related charge resulting from the Tax Act,neg,train
"Turning to the mobile devices market, the mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 14% of our sales for the full year of 2017",neg,train
Once again in the first quarter our team just did a great job and our performance in the mobile devices market was much stronger than expected,neg,train
We grew by a very substantial 69% from prior year as we capitalized on higher volumes of new products in particular related to smartphones as well as accessories,neg,train
"On a sequential basis, our sales grew by a very robust 18% from the already very strong third quarter",neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, we were very pleased that our sales for the mobile devices market increases by 12% from prior year and as you all remember, this is significantly ahead of our expectations coming into the year and even out of the second quarter",neg,train
"Our growth for the year was also driven by growth in smartphones and accessories, offset by declines in the volumes of tablet",neg,train
"So, Deepa, I think it is fair to assume that we don't have that included in our guidance",neg,train
We haven't guided to any of this excess tax benefit on our stock based compensation,neg,train
And the reason for that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and we do really believe that the availability to be able to compare our results especially since the tax benefit is going to be significantly reduced under this new Tax Act is important,neg,train
"So we are certainly not guiding to that and we are not included that in our adjusted guidance, adjusted EPS guidance for specifically that reason",neg,test
We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call,neg,train
No doubt about it that 2017 was an excellent year for our teams that are working in the industrial market,neg,train
We are very proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come,neg,train
"And the addition this quarter of CTI and various value add products that come with that acquisition, further strengthens our already robust position in value add interconnect assemblies for a wide range of segments in the industrial market",neg,train
"At December 31, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1",neg,train
"8 billion, the majority of which is currently held outside the US",neg,train
"Given the flexibility introduced by the previously discussed Tax Act relative to repatriation of foreign earnings, the company is currently in a process of assessing repatriation opportunities in 2018 and accordance with its capital allocation strategy",neg,train
"The company is consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment, we believe will be further enhance to the increased flexibility afforded by the modified territorial tax system, that's implemented in the recently passed US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act",neg,train
I mean I think dour is maybe a little strong word for the guidance,neg,train
I think we expect it to be for the year kind of flattish for the year which is not quite dour but certainly our performance in 2017 was not what we would have want to come into the year,neg,train
"And you'll recall 2016 was a very strong year for us in mobile network, Shawn",neg,test
And I think this year we saw a pull back in that and we expect that kind of a pause to continue into 2018 in particular as the 5G network as the planning goes on for those,neg,train
"Number two, it depends on what's happening with the various corporate ownership of those operators",neg,train
I think over the years the operators have gotten better at that last piece which is the monetization of the data traffic but still there is much work still to be done on finalizing these next generation network,neg,train
"Regardless of how it comes out, we've always been there and been ready as to waiting to capitalize on that pent-up demand when it eventually does get satisfied",neg,train
"As it relate to the buyback, I mean every quarter is a little different in terms of how we allocate capital and I wouldn't say that",neg,train
I think we actually had a lot of buybacks happening in the first half of the year and first three quarters of the year,neg,train
4 million shares for the year so I think that and if you look at the whole year I think that's kind of the context I would put it in,neg,train
I would really focus on from a buyback perspective or nor I would focus on from an M&A perspective piece,neg,train
That also has certainly its puts and takes from a quarter perspectives,neg,train
So overall from a capital allocation perspective I wouldn't take that I guess used amount in the first quarter as any change,neg,train
"I think as it relates to the new Tax Act, we really truly believe that the new territorial regime that is now in place under the new Tax Act really provides us with or further enhances our flexibility that we really think is a cornerstone, one of the cornerstones of our capital deployment strategy",neg,train
So in the short term from a capital deployment perspective I think that the flexibility introduced by act will ultimately help us in the long term,neg,train
It really isn’t going to have so much of an impact I think on our overall deployment strategy giving 50% of our return of capital for M&A with the other 50% going to return of capital to shareholders and any one quarter maybe different,neg,train
And our next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research,neg,train
"(NYSE:APH) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2018  1:00 PM ET",neg,train
"I mean relative to the overall M&A landscape and the cash that is maybe available to some companies, I personally would not expect that would have a significant change",neg,train
"It's not that we are now that we have availability and a flexibility that the Craig talked about so eloquently here from the tax reform, it's not that we are going just go change how we think about pricing on acquisition",neg,train
At an Amphenol we are not -- we don't view ourselves as a portfolio or manager per se where we buy things and then some day we sell them and we try to market time to buying and the selling of them,neg,train
And so we are going to remain very disciplined on price,neg,train
"As it relates to our overall M&A pipeline, we continue to have a very robust pipeline",neg,train
And we are very pleased to have closed on the two deals that we announced yesterday,neg,train
It is there another FCI kind of near and on the horizon that is not something that I would necessarily comment on today,neg,train
Except to say that we have never had as criteria for our acquisition program size,neg,train
I think that what we look for an acquisition is people number one,neg,train
We look for great management teams and we've been so successful in accomplishing that goal,neg,train
And we look for companies with complimentary market position to Amphenol,neg,train
So we'll continue to work hard at our acquisition program,neg,test
I think the balance of capital deployment at fragmented acquisition remain really a very high priority if not our highest priority together with investing in our organic growth,neg,train
"I mean I think it's really important to have a government that operate effectively and has budget, that's the time that those governments need budget",neg,train
"I remember there was lot of pain that everybody in the military industry went through a time when we were dealing with this bad word, sequestration which you all remember very well",neg,train
I wouldn’t' say that the current environment is anything like that sequestration,neg,train
We've been very favorable overall demand in the military market,neg,train
I think we've done even a little bit better than that when you look at our performance,neg,test
I think for a full year performance growing 13% organically and not forgetting that the prior year we grew 4% organically and that was including the DLA issue which is year and half ago,neg,train
Does not having a budget is jumping from CR to CR to CR in the budgeting process; put a damper on the demand for our products,neg,train
I have certainly heard some of our customers in the media talking about how for them it is concerning that there is not a real permanent budget and we would applaud any effort to get a budget done and little back as the military -- military certainly does not like to operate in time of uncertainty,neg,train
"And we've seen that just very broadly next generation system new product, a lot of new innovation, upgrades to existing products",neg,train
I mentioned that we've seen growth in the military market this year really very broadly,neg,train
If I look at all the little segment that we track in the military market essentially all but maybe one or two of them are up and are up in double digit on a full year basis,neg,train
And that's everything from communication to ordinance application to vehicles to airframe to naval to space,neg,train
So we are really pleased that it appears that sort of tilting of the balance maybe away from supporting day to day operating expenses in military and more towards the advanced electronics and advance capabilities that ultimately can be enabled by electronics,neg,train
I think that's the real favorable environment that our team has been able to capitalize upon,neg,test
"So regardless of whether the US kind of hopscotches between these continue resolution, I think we have a good outlook and I don't think that our outlook for the military market is anyway really based on those political soap opera in Washington",neg,train
I'd like to ask about capital allocation in particular the buyback slowed a little bit in the quarter relative to where it's been recently,neg,train
Is that related more to the acquisitions that you did in the quarter or is there anything else going on there? Thank you,neg,train
"And then just looking at the IT and datacom, it seems like your growth outlook for the year is relatively strong considering people's general view of that market low to mid single digit",neg,train
What's driving that? Is that again from the service side where you commented in some of the cloud business? Do you still see the storage market and the networking market as challenge maybe some more detail on that I think would be helpful? Thank you,neg,train
I just cannot emphasis how proud I am of our team working in this important market,neg,train
And reacting extremely quickly to be able to increase sales by this very significant amount,neg,train
I can tell you one thing and that our customers remain extremely satisfied to call Amphenol their partner knowing that we are there for them no matter when they need us,neg,train
The mobile devices market is of course an extremely dynamic and very exciting part of the overall electronics industry,neg,train
"This agility coupled with our leading array of interconnect antenna, mechanical and production related products, positions us strongly for the future",neg,train
"From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 11",neg,train
"2%, which is down compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 at 14",neg,train
"9%, primarily driven by an increase in certain commodity costs together with the lower volumes",neg,train
"4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, equal to the fourth quarter of last year",neg,train
"And with that operator, we will be very happy to take any questions that there maybe",neg,train
Our long-term mission remains the same and that is to be the enablers of the electronics revolution,neg,test
"And through the organic development efforts of our worldwide entrepreneurial organization together with the benefits from our acquisition program, we've expanded our partnerships with the broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end market",neg,train
This has resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronic industry,neg,train
Looking to the first quarter not surprisingly we expect the sequential reduction in sales of approximately 20% due to the typical seasonality that we see in this market,neg,train
"For the full year of 2018, we currently expect to realize low single digit growth in the mobile devices market",neg,train
The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 including the one-time tax related charge partially offset by approximately 550 basis points excess tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options was approximately 127%,neg,train
"Excluding these items, the adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26",neg,train
7% for the fourth quarter which is consistent with effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter and 8% of our sales for the full year of 2017,neg,test
Sales in mobile networks declined from prior year by a bit more than we had expected 7% in US dollars and 13% organically as mobile operators around the world continue to moderate their spending on network build out,neg,train
"Sequentially, our sales were down only slightly and what is normally is seasonally softer fourth quarter",neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, sales were down in low single digit as the overall spending environment for mobile operators remain muted",neg,train
"Looking ahead and given the uncertainty and the continued uncertainty I should say in the spending plans of wireless operators around the world, we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from current level",neg,train
"And for the full year of 2018, we do not yet anticipate a recovery in the spending environment and accordingly we anticipate sales to remain roughly at 2017 levels",neg,train
These amounts are the company's best estimate based on the current information and guidance available at this time and represent provisional estimates of the one-time tax related charge associated with the Tax Act which will be finalized in 2018,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Cash flow from operations was a record $428 million in the quarter and $1,neg,train
"1 billion for the full year, or approximately 156% and 116% of adjusted net income respectively",neg,train
"With respect to the fourth quarter, I mean Craig went over many of these details but just to reiterate, our results in the fourth quarter was a substantially stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted earnings, and reached new records in order sales and adjusted EPS",neg,train
dollars and 16% in local currency reaching another new record of $1,neg,train
I'll just say that we are pleased in particular that we grew organically in the quarter by very strong 13%,neg,train
Craig alluded to the company booked a new record $2 billion in orders and that not only represented an excellent book-to-bill of 1,neg,train
"03 to 1 but represent a 20% growth to prior year orders, a very, very strong finish from our booking",neg,train
"I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr",neg,train
Adam you highlighted a bunch of attributes for why you bought these two businesses,neg,train
Is it fair to assume SPC-related tax doesn't impact 2018 or going forward? And the reason I asked is your EPS growth guidance is pretty strong at 9% to 11% compared to your historical guide,neg,train
I mean I don't know that we would necessarily have dramatically better visibility than what get publicly announced about who is going to build what network when,neg,train
I think you've started to hear some prognosis about when certain networks are going to be built,neg,train
"Some of them around Olympic Games, some of them around other events and timing",neg,train
The question is not when the first network gets build,neg,train
The real question is when they really start to get build in true volume,neg,train
"And I mean you will remember certainly Craig when 3G, there were plenty of 3G trial network built or certain cities that were built, before you really started to see material levels of demand that were representing significant network build out for that equipment",neg,train
"And so when-- sometime you will see announcement, you will see announcements about certain things being built but that won't necessarily be the real volume increases that could ultimately satisfy this pent-up demand that I spoke off earlier",neg,train
"With respect to the content on 5G, every generation has different architectures, has different content, every vendor who makes this equipment has slightly different approaches to how they design things",neg,train
I wouldn't characterize 5G is having necessarily different content and what we've seen in 4G or 3G,neg,train
"what I would characterize though very clearly is that the performance requirement of what goes into 5G cell site whatever that is either in the base station or across the site, those performance requirements are clearly going to be higher than what we've seen in 4G",neg,train
And we have no reason to believe that won't be a very advanced technology going into these side pieces,neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank,neg,train
The breadth of our position is even more important in this environment as we are able to participate on a wide array of next generation military hardware,neg,train
"Looking ahead, while we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from this fourth quarter level, we do expect to achieve mid single digit sales growth in the military market for the full year 2018",neg,test
"Before I turn the call over to Adam, I'd like to make a brief comment relative to our 2018 earnings guidance",neg,train
"As mentioned earlier, our 2018 diluted EPS guidance reflects an estimated one point benefit on our 2018 effective tax rate from the Tax Act or approximately 25",neg,train
"5%, which compares to our 2017 adjusted effective tax rate of 26",neg,train
80 for the first quarter of 2018 or 13% to 16% growth versus the first quarter of 2017 adjusted diluted EPS,neg,train
"For the full year 2018, we anticipate diluted EPS of $3",neg,train
47 which represents a 9% to 11% growth versus full year of 2017 adjusted diluted EPS,neg,train
I think very clearly 2017 was another outstanding year for Amphenol,neg,train
We expanded our position in the overall market growing sales by 12% in both U,neg,train
dollars and local currencies reaching a new sales record of $7 billion and $11 million,neg,test
Organically we grew by a very strong 8% which was significantly higher than we had expected coming into the year,neg,test
Our full year adjusted operating margin also reached a new record of 20,neg,train
"4% and as Craig mentioned, this is the first time that we exceeded 20% return on sales for our full calendar year",neg,train
And our strong profitability enabled us to generate adjusted diluted EPS of $3,neg,train
Operating cash flow and free cash flow also were both records in the year at a $1,neg,train
There have been some discussions about certain materials like copper and other things like that but obviously our team was able to drive just outstanding results here regardless of any minor constraints that maybe there,neg,train
"Craig mentioned that we have seen some increased cost of certain commodities, and that was reflected most prominently in the margin that we saw in our cable business this quarter",neg,test
You look at some of the sequential growth that we are able to achieve also in over the course of this year in our industrial market in mil-aero,neg,train
So no question that our team was able to deal in that environment regardless whether there were constraints or not,neg,train
And so I don't think it's impacting Amphenol and it's certainly not impacting our outlook for 2018,neg,train
I mean it's hard for us to guide for the full year and to guide for our first quarter let alone to give any kind of intelligent and helpful guidance in terms of cadence over the course of those quarters,neg,train
"As you know, we are not very good at that",neg,train
I wouldn't say that there is anything terribly abnormal from what we see today but I would be hard pressed to try to paint for you a good picture of what each quarter is going to be sitting where we sit today,neg,train
The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year of 2017,neg,train
As we continue to make great progress penetrating a wide array of applications and new electronic systems with car makers around the world,neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, our sales in the automotive market grew by 16% in US dollars and 11% organically",neg,train
Another clear reflection of the company's ongoing progress and expanding position across the global automotive market,neg,train
"We are pleased in particular that in 2017 we realized double digit growth in all regions, North America, Europe and Asia",neg,train
"While this year's positive spending was no doubt a challenge for our team to manage, we are very pleased that we have continued to focus on our efforts to designing new products for a broad range of next generation networks including all important 5G network",neg,train
Thereby positioned the company to benefit when operators' spending does return to growth,neg,train
Our unique position with both equipment manufactures and mobile service providers create significant long-term potential for the company,neg,train
"Gross margins down slightly year-on-year, I know you mentioned kind of the cable weakness and that's an element",neg,train
Anything to keep in mind for a full year 2018 in terms of commodity input cost and how you are thinking about gross margin?,neg,train
"Also at the end of the quarter, the Company had issued approximately $1",neg,train
The Company's cash and availability under its credit facilities totaled approximately $2,neg,test
"Fourth quarter 2017, EBITDA was approximately $469 million bring the Company's fully year EBITDA to a record $1",neg,train
"From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter and year",neg,train

Speakers our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs,neg,train
"For the full year, the adjusted effective tax rate was 26",neg,train
5% for 2017 which excludes the excess tax benefits from option exercises and was consistent with 2016,neg,train
"On a GAAP basis, the Company's full year effective tax rate was approximately 51% and 27% for 2017 and 2016 respectively, reflecting that 2017 one-time charge and the tax effect of the acquisition related cost incurred during the respective years, partially offset by the approximate 490 basis points excess tax benefit of the exercise of stock option in 2017",neg,train
"As I mentioned in my prepared remarks Amit and with the current information and guidance available to us, create our best estimate and kind of what we have today",neg,train
There is a lot of moving part as it relate to the Tax Act,neg,train
"It was just passed 30 days ago, a little over 30 days ago",neg,train
So there is still a significant amount of interpretations and guidance coming out,neg,train
I mean there is guidance that came out just Friday of last week that we had to process,neg,test
So that's kind of what we are referring to in terms of we are still evaluating,neg,train
There are certain provisions in that that are certainly have some impact on us and other multinational companies,neg,train
But the one point that's kind of our best guess today based on what we know and we did say at least one point I wouldn't expect less than that,neg,train
And then a follow up question on the military segment which I know you did well in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Given some uncertainty around the US budget and government funding, when you talk to your customers how important is it to get a full year budget in order to achieve that outlook for the full year military revenue growth that the company guided to and is it something that can turn into any of your customer?",neg,train
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes,neg,train
"Operating income was $399 million for the fourth quarter, up 18% from 2016 and operating margin was a strong 20",neg,train
"5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, equal to our record and comparable to both the fourth quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017",neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment",neg,train
"As a follow up on mobile devices if I could and certainly understanding there is lot of volatility in that market but generally normal seasonality has sales rise in 2Q and again in 3Q off of a lower March quarter and as you guys are thinking about planning in the year, is your expectation that the build is different than normal seasonality this year?",neg,train
5% tax rate right now but doesn't sound like it's all finalized,neg,train
So what are the factors that you’re waiting for to get more clarity if you could just maybe call out a couple of those? And then do you think 25,neg,train
5% is the right tax rate or does it go down from there as you go into calendar 2019 as some of these things get sorted out?,neg,train
"Thank you very much, Jim and thanks for your kind word",neg,train
I mean relative to the outlook and I think specifically you are getting to the organic outlook for the year,neg,test
I mean we are coming -- our outlook here represents organic growth of 2% to 4% for the year and an overall growth of 6% to 8% for the year,neg,train
"If I just go back in time last January, I think our outlook was 0% to 2% organic growth for the year",neg,test
And if I look at our organic over last three years and in fact in 2017 we accelerated our organic growth,neg,train
We had 8% organic growth and in the prior two years our organic growth was a bit more muted but we complimented that with outstanding acquisitions in the year,neg,train
"So I would actually say that our guidance here for 2018 is a very, very robust guidance and it's a great blend in fact of both organic and acquisition contributions and represents a more favorable outlook than we've had really organically for the last three years",neg,test
So I think that's -- we feel very good about the guidance and about how we are looking into 2018,neg,train
"And relative to mobile, I think, you know that mobile some years Q4 is very strong relative to Q3, other years it's more balanced across the quarter",neg,train
And so we've seen reductions sometimes of more than 30% in the first quarter for mobile and we've seen other quarter's growth more like this 20%,neg,train
Is this 20% a little bit on the lower end? It's certainly lower than the 30% we've seen in some other years but it's not uniquely low,neg,train
I think we've had other years where mobile is down roughly about 20%,neg,train
But we talked earlier with one of your peer's questions I think we do have a slightly more favorable view of the mobile market sitting where we sit today and maybe part of that is associated with that little bit lower sequentially we find the first quarter,neg,train
"Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation",neg,train
"Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session",neg,test
"Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode",neg,train
"At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded",neg,train
"If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time",neg,train
You guys have seen excellent growth in those two end markets,neg,train
And you are guiding to mid-teen to high teens growth in those two segments in 2018,neg,train
I was hoping if you could give us a little more detail on what you are seeing from an end market perspective? And is that driven by a better economic outlook across the different geographies? And how much of that is coming from organic growth versus non organic growth?,neg,train
I mean the way that we build our guidance is really through our internal forecasting process which is based ultimately and what we hear from our customers talking to our sales people,neg,train
"And what we don't do is we don't read the paper and say, well, we think there is a certain trends that maybe coming and we should adjust our guidance accordingly",neg,test
And if the overall market changes then we would be very happy to be there to enable that higher level of spending,neg,train
It's not something that we've seen from customers and so our guide in corporate executive what we hear from the customers,neg,train
But today what we see and what we hear from our customers is embedded here and what we guided to,neg,train
The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of sales both in the fourth quarter and for 2017,neg,train
And sales in the fourth quarter increased from prior year by a robust 11% as aircraft manufactures increased their procurement after several quarters of moderate spending pattern,neg,train
"Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the third quarter",neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, our sales were up by 3% as the benefit of Phitek acquisition completed in the first quarter, as well as the strength in large passenger plane volume was offset by continued moderation in demand for both helicopters and business jets",neg,train
As I mentioned before I mean 2018 is certainly there is some impact from commodities and the cable segment as I mentioned,neg,train
But over time I don't think there is anything that's holding us back since we are at 20% that wasn't holding us back or helping us before we are at 20% level,neg,train
There is nothing from a leverage perspective that changes anything right now,neg,train
And these general managers do a fantastic job as they have done before the company was overall at 20% in regards to maximizing the profitability and whether or not they do it out of SG&A or whether or not they do it in the factory or whatever else,neg,train
But in any one year there will be things that will impact it such as the commodities that have had some impact in 2017 in the cable segment and into 2019,neg,train
"Looking into 2018, while we anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of sales in the first quarter, we do expect to achieve low to mid single digit sales growth for the full year",neg,train
The IT datacom market remains a very exciting place with both traditional and new customers constantly striving to upgrade their equipment to manage the immense expansion of data traffic,neg,train
Our team remains at the forefront of efforts to enable this revolution in the IT datacom market,neg,train
"Through their ongoing development of next generation, leading high speed power and fiber optic technologies",neg,train
"As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements",neg,train
So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information,neg,train
"During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company incurred one time tax related charge of approximately $400 million or $1",neg,train
26 per share resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,neg,train
This charge reflects a shift to a modified territorial tax regime and includes our current estimate of the U,neg,train
toll charge related to the deemed repatriation of cumulative unremitted foreign earnings which will be paid over a period of eight years,neg,train
"Local taxes related to the cumulative unremitted foreign earnings due to our intention over time to repatriate our foreign cash which will be paid when those respective earnings are repatriated, partially offset by an adjustment of certain U",neg,train
deferred tax balances due to the change in the tax rate,neg,train
I'll now turn it over Adam who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends,neg,train
"Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher average interest rates, resulting from the senior notes issuance earlier in the year, as well as the higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the Company's stock buyback program",neg,train

"Well, I am not going to quantify it but what I said consistently is we've seen just outstanding performance from that",neg,train
And I think ultimately if you think about the driver of why this demand is increasing,neg,train
"I mean you see just so many opportunities coming the demand for video and the internet, the demand for consumers consuming things in the mobility that they won't otherwise consuming, I mean crazy things I mean now that it appears that there is video game league that are popular than natural sports leagues and people are watching these on their mobile devices, they are streaming them, they are doing all of these",neg,train
"These are all the kinds of drivers that are ultimately create, putting, forcing the data through the network",neg,train
"And as we've seen that shift towards these new web service providers, a lot of the backbone for these new consumption of video is happening through this web service providers, and so we've just -- that has been a real driver of growth and we would anticipate it to continue to be",neg,train
And we saw this quarter in our IT datacom market where in fact in the fourth quarter our sales were slightly down and that's despite having an excellent year going 9% for the full year,neg,train
But we had had a year before an outstanding finish to the year where we've seen really significant investment in particular in web service providers,neg,train
So I wouldn't be surprised if there is a little bit more of that kind of operator type service provider type volatility in the IT market for some portion of it,neg,train
"Is it today the dominant part of our IT datacom market? No, it's not",neg,test
"But has it been a real significant driver of growth for that? Yes, no question about it, it has and we would anticipate that going forward",neg,train
"Orders for the quarter were record $2 billion, a 20% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1",neg,train
I think that's right in regard to the full year 2018 in the first quarter,neg,train
I think that certainly commodities do have some level of impact specifically regarding to the cable segment,neg,test
We've talked about this when I talked about the reason for the reduction in the profitability in that segment,neg,test
And the acquisitions while they are accretive from an EPS perspective do sometimes have some operating profitability level that are a little bit less than or in some cases some significantly less than our corporate average,neg,train
And one this is usually happens before we've been able to have them adopt kind of Amphenol operating principle and then get them up to a level,neg,train
And we saw this in 2016 in a magnified effect when we looked at the full year piece of FCI which we were able to get much quicker than we expected,neg,train
And that's a little bit what you are seeing in 2018 as you compared to 2017,neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, sales were a record $7",neg,train
"011 billion, up 12% in US dollars and in local currencies and up a very strong 8% organically compared to 2016, an excellent performance",neg,train
"And I guess Adam just on mobile devices, I think last year maybe prior to that as well when you start off the year and give annual guide, you always kind of start off with a flat expectations for that segment, saying it's volatile to be kind of predictive, which makes sense",neg,test
"What do you see better today that, again, you're not dramatically more positive in that, but you're talking about low single digit growth",neg,train
"So I guess versus the last few years, what do you see sort of different in mobile devices that makes you take a more positive stance and more sort of flat number you typically talked about?",neg,train
Can you comment on how the tax windfall for some US based companies can or cannot change the M&A landscape within the connector space? Also within your M&A pipeline could you talk about a larger -- a potential for larger acquisitions not that FCI is completed integrated?,neg,train
"Most of -- what I want to ask has been asked but I just wanted to square some of the guides on like mobile network kind of what some of the news flow that you are seeing about post merger kind of just illusion, better CapEx estimate or something, is your guide kind of like what's actually been like were there actual actively procuring right now or is this kind of very short focused on what you are seeing right now or just kind of taking into consideration kind of longer term plans and maybe you are not seeing active in the market quite yet",neg,train
"Well, thank you very much Craig and thank you all for taking the time to listen in on our conference call today",neg,train
And hope it's not too late to wish everybody a Happy New Year,neg,train
I'll discuss the trends and progress across our served market and then I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2018,neg,train
"Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% of sales in the full year 2017",neg,train
Sales decrease by 8% in the quarter as operators paused their spending on network build out,neg,train
"On a sequential basis, our sales were down a bit more than expected 14% from the third quarter",neg,train
"While we did realize growth of 5% in the broadband market in 2017 with the contributions from our acquisition, organically our sales were down mid single digit by about 5% in the face of a challenging demand year",neg,train
Operating spending this year was impacted a number of external factors including in particular the various strategic combinations being considered among customers,neg,train
"Nevertheless, we come out of 2017 very pleased that our product diversification efforts in the broadband market have positioned us very well for the future",neg,test
"And then similar on data and devices, I think the plans out of like the hyper scale like the Web 2",neg,train
0 Company seems to be pretty good as far as datacenter into next year,neg,train
And how big of a piece of the business is that portion of the market for you guys now?,neg,train
"Well, I think if you with Shawn's question I think there is something related to that which is we clearly had a very significant over achievement here in the second half",neg,train
"When we think about our mobile devices business, in the mobile devices market for us second half to first half was up by nearly 90%, I mean that was very, very strong performance by our team and I cannot just emphasize enough how much hard work goes in for that",neg,train
"Again, with the caveat that I always make that you never know in the mobile devices market",neg,train
We just felt that coming into this year on the basis of all that we know from our customers that it's a little bit obviously a little bit more favorable outlook than what we've seen over the prior three years,neg,train
"Now, I am not going to tell you I am any more dependable on our outlook on mobile devices",neg,train
"I have been for three years running very undependable in those same three years that you correctly point out, we guided it flat",neg,train
"Fortunately, I was wrong to the upside two out of the three years",neg,train
And I was wrong to the downside one or other,neg,test
"But-- and we've always tried to guide on the basis of what we see at the beginning of the year, that's the best that we can do here",neg,test
And I think just this time what we see today sitting here in January is a little bit more favorable than what we've seen in the prior three January,neg,train
"Now turning to the trends in our served markets and just reflecting back again on 2017, we were very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification is continue to create real value for the company",neg,train
"Once again, no end market represented more than 20% of our sales for the full year and we remain very steadfast on our belief that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end market while exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arrive across the electronics industry",neg,train
"Adam, just question on mobile networks and just the transition to 5G",neg,train
"Just curious kind of what typically your visibility would be into that transition and then once that happened even if it later this year early next year, is there anything to keep in mind from a content perspective or opportunity set for Amphenol?",neg,test
"From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1",neg,train
6 billion and $875 million respectively at the end of December,neg,test
"In inventory days, day sales outstanding and payables days excluding the impact of acquisition were 76, 73 and 60 days respectively, all within our normal range",neg,train
dollars and up 16% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased a very strong 13%",neg,train
"Our Cable business, which comprises 5% of our sales, was down 5% from the fourth quarter of last year",neg,train
"The Interconnect business, which comprised 95% of our sales, was up 19% in U",neg,train
"dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth, as well as the impact of acquisitions",neg,train
The information technology and data communication networks represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% of sales for the full year of 2017,neg,train
"As we had anticipated coming into the fourth quarter, our sales were slightly down from prior year as stronger sales of products used in servers were more than offset by a moderation of demand in both networking and storage relating equipment",neg,train
"Sequentially, sales were only slightly down from the third quarter which was actually a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter",neg,test
"For the full year of 2017, our sales in IT datacom grew by strong 9% US dollars and 6% organically which is really great performance given the overall spending environment, as well as the significant strength that you all recall we had realized in 2016",neg,train
Our organic growth in IT datacom is a real testament to our team's effort to develop leading technologies while rapidly pivoting for the opportunities for growth created by new customers in this important market,neg,test
"For the full year of 2018, we expect sales in the range of $7",neg,train
600 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $3,neg,train
For the full year this represents sales and diluted EPS growth of 6% to 8% and 9% to 11% over 2017 sales and adjusted diluted EPS level,neg,train
All these acquisitions have already begun to create value for the company and most importantly we've now been joined by great range of talented individual which thereby deepens the bench of our already impressive management team,neg,train
4 million shares under our $1 billion share buyback program and you'll recall increasing -- that we increased our quarterly dividend by 19% during the year,neg,train
So turning to those markets specifically starting with the military market,neg,train
The military market represented 10% of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for 2017,neg,train
"Sales in the military market rose strongly in the fourth quarter rising by a greater than expected 11%, driven by growth in really most segment of the military market",neg,train
"And that included in particular aircraft, space, naval and communication application",neg,train
"Sequentially, our sales in military increased by a very robust 10%",neg,train
"And for the full year 2017, we were pleased that our military sales grew by very strong 13%, all organic reflecting broad based strength across virtually all segments of the market",neg,train
Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team at Amphenol,neg,train
I have two questions are little bit related so I just asked about the same time,neg,train
"Adam on your outlook for 2018, if you look at it percent basis about the growth of 2018 versus 2017 and you consider that some of the acquisitions were recently announced today so they will help boost the growth rate as well as some of the acquisitions announced previously during 2017 haven't had the full year",neg,train
It just seems like the growth rate is kind of down shifted from what it has been in the past few years organically,neg,train
Am I right on that or off on that? Maybe you correct me or help me find logic,neg,train
"And then underscoring that I think Adam you had mentioned mobile devices for Q1 is typically down about 20% and that's what you are guiding too, it looks like in the past was down much more or maybe just kind of close to rounding numbers",neg,train
Just so I understand is the difference in the procurement is one more just like are the cloud guys more willing to do just more in time and hold us inventory than the equipment guys that would lead to that volatility?,neg,train
The cash flow from operations of $428 million along with the stock option proceeds of $50 million were used primarily to fund net capital expenditures of $69 million,neg,train
"The purchase approximately $62 million of the Company’s stock, to fund dividend payments of $58 million, to acquisitions of $22 million, and to repay $20 million under the commercial paper program, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $264 million net of translation",neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
We are very pleased to be able to announce two new acquisitions,neg,train
One that was completed late in December and one that was completed here in January,neg,train
"First, Sunpool which we closed on late in the month of December, it's China based provider of high technology antennas for the Chinese automotive market with annual sales of approximately $30 million",neg,train
"The company which has revenues of approximately $60 million, manufactures its products in Canada, Mexico and China and serve the broad range of important and complimentary customers to our existing customer base",neg,train
Company enhances our already industry leading value add interconnect capabilities across this really wide range of end markets and application,neg,train
Speakers our next question comes from Will Stein from SunTrust,neg,train
"As you can see on Slide 14, total loans were down slightly compared to the third quarter",neg,train
"However, for the full year, we posted modest 1% loan growth despite the headwinds that Steve and Steven noted",neg,train
"As expected, we continued to see CRE pay downs in the fourth quarter driven by the flatter yield curve that we noted in our third quarter call",neg,train
"However, our commercial real estate team is back in full production mode and has capacity under our internal concentration limits to book new transactions",neg,train
"Well, I mean, healthcare is a kind of a broad term for us",neg,train
"One is, hospitals and in that segment it’s generally high in credit in large metro urban areas",neg,train
"That’s an area that there is opportunity, but it’s not – spreads aren’t large",neg,train
There is other ancillary business that drives that from a business development perspective including cash management and investment management services there,neg,train
"In addition, we made our customary $2 million annual contribution to the BOKF Foundation to fund our community engagement efforts",neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
Our first question comes from the line of Brady Gailey with KBW,neg,train
"As Steve noted, the three main headwinds that hampered loan growth in 2017 are behind us and our entire team feels more optimistic on this front than they did 90 days ago",neg,test
We expect available-for-sale securities to be flat to slightly down,neg,test
"3% for the full year, which is a testament to the commitment to the industry that we maintained during the recent downturns, which clearly differentiated us against other energy banks",neg,train
"During that time, we were able to book over $1 billion of new commitments to healthy borrowers which in 2017 translated into well-structured and well-priced loan growth in the energy industry",neg,train
"We are pleased that despite the 22% annual decrease in mortgage revenue, our other businesses and particularly our fiduciary and asset management which grew 20",neg,train
"2% for the full year, we are able to compensate for this enabled us to keep fees and commissions relatively flat for the full year",neg,train
"So I think it was just really being trying to be wise about how we spend our dollars in 2018 and I think, we’ve built a plan that expects low-single-digit expense growth for next year",neg,train
"During 2017, wealth management continues its impressive growth track record and generated record financial results",neg,train
This was a big driver of our performance during the year,neg,train
"So I’d ask Scott Grauer, our Executive Vice President of Wealth Management Group to make a few remarks",neg,train
"On Slide 7, you’ll see highlights of the Wealth Management division’s preliminary 2017 financial results",neg,test
"And then, just finally for me, on the allowance level, I hear you about the strength of the quality of the portfolio",neg,train
"But just looking back, sort of over the last few years, the allowance to loans has been high",neg,train
At what point would we – where do we have to get to in terms of allowance to loans before we stop serve looking at potential zero provision or negative provision?,neg,test
"Just, on the CRE side, I guess, last quarter, with the paydowns and it seems like maybe you are a little more optimistic, I thought it sounded like you are a little more optimistic on being able to see a better net growth this quarter or the – with the level of paydowns it’s higher than you had expected and it was not spread out through the quarter or is more front-end loaded and that’s giving you the confidence for net growth?",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
This translated into significant meaningful earnings leverage for the division,neg,train
"Loans and deposits were up 16% and 13% respectively in 2017, which are among the highest growth rates achieved in the company this year",neg,train
"So, the asset allocation mix of our AUMA is 11% cash, 48% fixed income, 34% equity and about 7% alternatives",neg,train
"In commercial real estate, we have the capacity to book new deals and in fact booked $931 million of new commitments in the second half of 2017",neg,test
"And with tax reform now law, we expect our C&I clients to accelerate growth plans",neg,train
"Second, we now expect two rate hikes in 2018 instead of one, and on the heels of the December 2017 hike, this should drive continued margin expansion and growth in net interest income",neg,train
We work steadily to prioritize to reduce expense growth throughout the fourth quarter and now expect very modest expense growth in 2018,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D,neg,train
We expect continued modest growth in net interest margin with rate hikes in March and September embedded within our forecast and assuming continued active management and control of deposit pricing,neg,train
We expect mid-single-digit net interest revenue growth reflecting the additional rate hikes that we did not have in our forecast 90 days ago,neg,train
"Well I think, clearly, liquidity of the borrowers represent a risk and I think that that is in conversations and if you look at the depth of our portfolio and where really the headwinds came from in 2017, commercial real estate being down roughly 10% year-over-year was the biggest headwind by far and so if we can stabilize that and even begin to move that up particularly in the latter half of the year with outstandings, that’s going to make a huge difference in terms of total portfolio loan growth",neg,train
I think the one aspect of CRE that that we have really stayed away from in the last ten years is the homebuilder segment where margins are so low and there is such little ability to navigate a downturn,neg,train
We were much more active and that historically have had very little marketing or business development push in that space subsequent to the financial downturn,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James,neg,train
None of this happens of course without a highly ethical and talented group of professionals that form our BOK Financial team,neg,train
"Their ability to attract and return quality customers in every business segment is the reason we were able to post new record earnings, while being recognized as being one of America’s most respected banks",neg,train
The 14% sequential decrease that you’ll note in other revenue at the bottom of this chart is due to the sale of merchant banking portfolio companies earlier in the year for which we consolidated revenue,neg,train
There is a corresponding decrease in other expense on the income statement,neg,train
"And then, wanted to hear maybe some thoughts on managing the securities portfolio, I think everybody is looking for a few rate hikes this year",neg,train
What’s the plan? What the duration on the securities book and what do you guys apply and how much cash flow are you expecting this year from that?,neg,train
"As you look forward, can you just kind of break down where you see yourselves deploying the additional earnings from tax reform? Whether it be in investments, growth, M&A or capital return?",neg,train
But I would say rather than stating we are going to take X percent of that tax benefit and plough it back into certain areas,neg,test
And when do you see for the paydowns? Do you think that will be as high in 2018 as they were in 2017 through the industry?,neg,train
I heard all the commentary in terms of the more positive outlook on loan growth,neg,train
"I am just wondering though, is there a little bit of concern about, when you look at borrowers having record levels of liquidity and their cash flows have now increased with tax reform that you could continue to see ongoing paydowns in the loan portfolio?",neg,train
"That definition changed effectively in January, but still relatively true",neg,train
We have more than double the number of energy deals that we lead over the last few years,neg,train
I mean there are so many fixed costs associated with an acquisition that,neg,train
"Again, we are still – now market that we are in today that we think we would benefit by adding scale",neg,train
"Excluding this impact, we saw healthy continued growth in both metrics as we continue to see only limited pressure on deposit cost in the fourth quarter",neg,test
"So, we don’t see that as a constraint in the next 12 to 18 months",neg,train
"In the third quarter, we guided mid-single-digit out in the future",neg,train
"But, as I mentioned then, we had a lot of work to do in our budgeting process and as Steve and I and all of the executive leadership team spend a tremendous amount of hours working through our budgets for 2018, looking at areas that we felt like we could tighten the belt, particularly in the non-personnel side",neg,train
"And then, maybe as a follow-up, before this year, you guys have had some pretty good growth in some of your smaller markets like Colorado, Arizona, et cetera? But that growth is kind of seem to stall out a little bit",neg,train
What’s some of the outlook for those markets if we want to think about it on a state-by-state basis? Thanks,neg,train
"For the full year, fees and commissions were down 0",neg,train
Note that this quarter we reclassified approximately $5 million of quarterly revenues from transaction processing to deposit service charges and fees,neg,train
Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day,neg,train
"BOK Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:BOKF)  Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call  January 24, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,test
"Scott Grauer - Executive Vice President, Wealth Management, CEO, BOK Financial Securities, Inc",neg,train
"We posted very strong growth in net interest income, and net interest margin",neg,train
Our fee businesses combined to overcome a downward shift in mortgage production and expense management was strong all year long for our goal of delivering flat expenses on a GAAP basis from 2016 levels in order to drive earnings leverage,neg,train
We’ve been between 20% and 25% there on average over time and I would expect us to move back to that level,neg,train
We do see that as a great opportunity for growth in 2018 outsize growth relative to the rest of the portfolio,neg,test
"So, clearly as a percentage, we would expect that to go up",neg,train
"Today we’ll hear remarks about the quarter from Steve Bradshaw, our CEO; Scott Grauer, EVP Wealth Management, Steven Nell, CFO; and Stacy Kymes, EVP, Corporate Banking",neg,train
PDFs of the slide presentation and fourth quarter press release are available on our website at www,neg,train
But I expect us to get some benefit from the couple of rate hikes that we’ve modeled in our asset liability modeling,neg,train
And we see some improvement in net interest margin although modest in 2018 and of course the securities portfolio is just part of all of that active management,neg,train
"Brokerage and trading and fiduciary and asset management, but it also includes net interest income from loans and deposits in our private banking group",neg,train
Greetings and welcome to the BOK Financial Corporation Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call,neg,train
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation,neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded",neg,test
"It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Crivelli, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations",neg,train
2 billion were down slightly from the end of the third quarter,neg,test
This was below our expectations as loan growth for the year was just 1%,neg,train
We attribute the less robust loan growth in 2017 to three factors,neg,train
"You saw our healthcare has a strongest fourth quarter since they’ve been a line of business we think obviously, if you look at that over a trend line, they’ve grown very, very well and we are still very optimistic about healthcare",neg,test
"For us, that’s largely senior housing and where the spreads are appropriate for the risk that we take there",neg,train
Arizona continues to be a very focused growth market for us,neg,train
"Stacy, you made a comment earlier about, I think you said more opportunity to lead energy deals and the potential fees that come along with that",neg,train
"While the change in corporate tax rates will have significant long-term benefits for BOK as shareholders, there was a modest $11",neg,train
18 per share write-down of our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"As noted, given the current credit environment and the quality of our loan portfolio, we are biased towards additional releases of loan loss reserve at least through the first half of 2018",neg,train
And we are forecasting a blended state and federal effective tax rate in the 22% to 23% range for 2018,neg,test
"For commercial real estate? I do not, I think that you had a flattening of the yield curve that happened in the third and fourth quarter that really push folks where the difference between fixed and floating, whether that’s great relative to kind of a permanent long-term rate without recourse and we had more in that queue that we are eligible if you will to move that direction",neg,train
We expect revenues from fee-generating businesses to be up low-single-digits for the year,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust,neg,train
"If you have any follow-up questions, please give me a call",neg,test
I think we see relatively flat securities balances out in the future,neg,train
"I mean, part of that is just to maintain neutrality as it relates to interest rate risk",neg,train
We have proven to be somewhat asset-sensitive as rates have gone up certainly in 2017,neg,train
"So I would say on the short-term, we are asset-sensitive and we’ll manage the portfolio to kind of accommodate that longer-term and higher rate environment, perhaps we are more neutral",neg,test
"Also, although net charge-offs were elevated in the fourth quarter, and net charge-offs for the full year were very modest 9 basis points compared to 22 basis points in 2016",neg,train
"As I’ll discuss in the guidance section, our bias at the moment is towards additional reversals in 2018",neg,train
"And so, I think that the liquidity challenge that you mentioned is one that’s been talked about in the industry really since the financial downturn where borrowers were flushed with liquidity",neg,train
"So, watching deposits decline before you would begin to see loan growth that hasn’t necessarily manifested itself in that manner",neg,train
The fourth quarter was largely a quiet quarter from an expense standpoint,neg,train
"We contributed our customary $2 million to the BOKF foundation, in addition, a large customer-facing IT project was put into production mode which caused professional fees and services to increase $3",neg,train
"I don’t think it’s more attractive relative to bank M&A, but we would continue to look at opportunities to grow",neg,train
"Well, that’s part of the story about the strong performance in the last couple of years and the improving efficiency how that businesses that we did acquire multiple businesses kind of in that 2012 to 2015 range and we are reaping the benefit of that today",neg,train
"And then, if I could just ask one follow-up to Steve on M&A",neg,train
"Just curious what you are seeing on M&A? We heard from one bank that said M&A activity is kind of halted for the time being as the sellers look at and try to extrapolate what the tax reform really means, and so it’s halted a little bit",neg,train
"Obviously, the big driver in 2017was the decrease in mortgage banking revenue, which was in turn driven by higher rate environments which limited refinance productions volume",neg,train
The lower volume industry-wide also translated to lower gain on sale margins in the mortgage business,neg,train
We refer you to the disclaimers on Slide 2 as it pertains to any forward-looking statements we make during this call,neg,train
"And so, given where we are in the cycle, we are not back to kind of disclosing by segment, because I never thought that was a particularly insightful way to look at that and particularly now that we are past the downturn, I don’t want to get into that",neg,train
"Well, I mean, we don’t really stayed at the floor",neg,train
"We won’t go past and it all just depends on the full analysis of what our model tells us and our judgment around and expectations around non-performings and potential problem loans and that’s the way we guide, that’s the way we calculate it and we don’t have a certain spot that we say we just won’t pass through this level",neg,train
"Well, I guess, it depends on what portion of the real estate sector you play in",neg,train
"I think in the sector we play in, we’ve seen stable spreads there",neg,train
Others have – particularly our size and larger have been somewhat constrained in their growth in this space,neg,train
"Clearly, retail is an area we would do retail commercial real estate today, but obviously a lot more work and analysis goes into that given what we see there",neg,test
"We are not of the opinion that the retail segment is headed for a cliff, but clearly there is an impact to retail particularly goods based retail and so we do a lot of work there as we’d evaluate that segment",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"The growth was driven by loan growth and net interest margin expansion combined with higher trust fees, as these are typically driven by assets under management, as well as the new trading desk we established last year in Stanford Connecticut that expanded our offerings to the mortgage industry and mortgage-backed security investors",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo,neg,train
It seems like the – that pricing still is very tied with very tight spreads,neg,train
Is that holding you back at all in this year assumption for growth assume that we see an improving pricing market on the CRE side or is that not necessarily a requirement?,neg,train
"Our origination - kind or retail origination actually, we believe that will be up a little bit for the year",neg,train
"It’s been a significant opportunity for us to demonstrate leadership in this space, particularly in deal sizes, $500 million or less in total",neg,train
We compete effectively with anybody in the country of – a bank of any size,neg,train
And our borrower base has appreciated our commitment to this space,neg,train
Thanks for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results,neg,train
The fourth quarter wrapped up a very strong year for BOK Financial,neg,train
"In addition, we successfully managed expenses substantially below our revenue growth rate",neg,train
"For the year, total revenue is defined by pre-provision, net interest revenue, plus fees and commissions was up 6",neg,train
4% but total expenses was up less than 1% driving meaningful and significant earnings leverage,neg,train
"And then lastly, just on the provision, I heard, you talked about additional loan loss reserve reversals in 2018",neg,train
Do you think that translates into just a few quarters of a zero provision or do you think we can actually continue to see a negative provision for 2018?,neg,train
"I think that extra retained earnings that we’ll have, we’ll just throw in the mix of capital allocation like we’ve always thought about it",neg,train
"As Steve mentioned earlier, our number one capital deployment opportunity is organic growth",neg,train
Certainly some of that could be used for opportunistic M&A,neg,train
"And then second, for us, while it has not happened, there is certainly legislative momentum, regulatory momentum if you will to move the SIFI threshold higher",neg,train
And that would be very meaningful for a bank like BOK Financial if we were to look at larger size deals,neg,train
"Today, if you bump up against that $50 billion, there is a substantial increase in operating expenses that in many ways mutes or negates the value of a larger deal",neg,train
2017 results reflects our company’s core strategy of strong credit discipline and an array of diverse revenue sources to overcome cyclical downturns and slower loan demand,neg,train
We have a differentiated business model unlike any other mid-sized regional bank,neg,train

"And then, in the press release, you’ll notice several one-time items that we had in the fourth quarter, one being a contribution to our foundation and a few other items",neg,train
"So, that’s the way I would kind of look at the first quarter and build up the remainder of the year",neg,train
"And so, while retail maybe a slowing segment, we think that industrial warehouse is an increasing segment",neg,train
"11 per diluted share, just under our highest EPS performance that we achieved back in 2012",neg,train
"All through the year we saw strong growth in net interest margin and net interest income, combined with outstanding results from our Wealth Management division, which continues to benefit from the strong economy in market, success attracting assets from external money managers and demographic trends which point to continued long-term growth",neg,train
"Just going back to the M&A discussion, you guys have historically done some smaller wealth or asset management deals",neg,train
Is that it’s still navigated – maybe a little bit more attractive to you near-term relative to bank M&A?,neg,train
The base – the expense baseline you’d like us to use is the reported number $1 billion $26 million?,neg,train
I wanted just to go back to talking about the loan portfolio and the growth in 2018,neg,train
"I was curious, we are seeing some folks provide some healthcare and I am just curious I know credit quality in that portfolio hasn’t been impacted, but I am just curious to hear if any changes in that industry impact the outlook for that portfolio’s growth this year and how you view that sort of with maybe some reduced competition?",neg,train
"And then, if you look at energy, if I look back kind of a two or three years ago, I think you guys had energy at about 20% of loans that fell to under 15%",neg,train
Now we are kind of on the swing back up which finished the year in a little over 17%,neg,train
Do you think just given where oil is at? I know you guys are committed to the safety,neg,train
Do you think that your exposure to energy should grow a little bit from here just as that backdrop has improved?,neg,test
"You still have to deal with the impacts of the paydowns that we suffered in the third and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter in commercial real estate as the yield curve flattened, particularly our industrial portfolio which has a high credit tenant occupancy was really hit hard those moved to the permanent financing market and it will take us a bit to move through that from an outstanding perspective, but we can move pretty quickly to replace it from a committed perspective",neg,train
"For the full year, net charge-offs were a very modest 9 basis points, down from 22 basis points in 2016",neg,train
"Accordingly, we are guiding to a more normalized mid-single-digit loan growth rate in 2018 as Steven will discuss in a moment",neg,train
We are really biased towards the negative provision for the first couple of quarters in 2018 honestly,neg,test
"When you take a look at our expectations for our non-accrual loans, our expectations for potential problem loans, we continue to see that moving down and improving",neg,train
"So, given our already very, very strong reserve, we feel like at least at this point, we are biased towards releases early in the year",neg,train
"As you can see, even in the worst downturn since the 1980s, losses were manageable, which demonstrates the message we’ve been consistently delivering to investors",neg,train
We understand the cyclicality of the energy business and we underwrite and structure the portfolio with time tested discipline to minimize losses in downturns,neg,train
"And Stacy, can you just remind us what the internal concentration limits are?",neg,train
We feel that all three of these headwinds are now behind us,neg,train
"The healthcare group booked record new commitments in the fourth quarter exceeding the previous record set in the first quarter of 2016, almost two years ago",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC,neg,train
The credit environment was benign in 2017 as well and our energy portfolio continued to improve,neg,train
"Thus in the fourth quarter, we released $7 million of loan loss reserves which positively impacted our earnings",neg,train
"And finally, the change in hedging strategy for our MSR assets led to much more manageable impact on 2017 results",neg,train
"In terms of wealth management, can you just remind us how much of your assets under management are actually tied to the equity markets? Because, I am just looking back at Slide 7, I see your total revenues are up about 11%, clearly the market is up a lot more than that last year and I am just wondering how much is not tied or tied in that type of things?",neg,test
And you know as rate rise will plough some of that back in at the appropriate time,neg,train
"Finally, with the search in new money and increases in the equity and fixed income markets during the fourth quarter, we ended the year with fiduciary assets of $48",neg,train
1% for the year and total assets under management or in custody up 8,neg,train
5% and surpassing $80 billion for the first time in our company’s history,neg,test
It’s something we’ve been doing for in excess of 15 years,neg,train
We have – it’s a dedicated line of business for us,neg,train
We have a full-time analyst on our staff who does nothing other than look for changes in federal and state reimbursement activity and budget issues that could impact our customers and our underwriting in those states,neg,train
And so that has enabled spreads to stay much more stable than they typically would this long into a recovery cycle where you typically have kind of rates to tighter spreads,neg,train
I think spreads here has stayed very stable from our perspective in the category of commercial real estate lending that is our sweet spot,neg,train
"2 million to 2017 revenue, a $9 million increase from 2016",neg,train
"Net direct contribution, which is operating income before corporate allocations was up an even more robust 46",neg,train
This was the result of careful expense management as total operating expenses for the division before corporate allocations were actually down 1,neg,train
I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments,neg,train
"There will still be paydowns or paydowns every year, commercial real estate probably has an average life of 2",neg,test
"It was just more than the typical amount and I think it was because you had so much that was taking advantage of a steeper yield curve and when the yield curve began to flatten, use that as an opportunity to push out into the permanent financing market",neg,train
"There will still be some of that and we always have that in commercial real estate, but I think to a lesser extent in 2018 than we had in 2017",neg,train
"As noted on Slide 9, net interest income for the quarter was $216",neg,train
"These are down slightly from the third quarter, but keep in mind that non-accrual interest recoveries added $4",neg,test
7 million to net interest income and 6 basis points to net interest margin in the third quarter,neg,train
"So, in essence, it’s a 175% of Tier-1 capital and reserves measured on a committed basis, not on an outstanding basis",neg,train
"And so given the growth dynamics and the credit dynamics, I mean, would it be fair to say it could be significantly lower than where we are?",neg,train
Stacy Kymes will now review the home portfolio in more detail,neg,train
I’ll now turn the call back over to Steve Bradshaw for closing commentary,neg,train
"In the lower right corner of Slide 16, we have provided a five-year look at net charge-offs for the exploration and production business, which makes up 85% of our energy portfolio, as well as the overall energy banking business, so that you have a clear picture of losses before, during and after the cycle",neg,train
And what’s the remaining reserve on energy at the end of the year?,neg,train
"Certainly, as it relates to the fourth quarter, there were more paydowns earlier in the quarter than later",neg,train
"But I think, we’ve seen that kind of group of loans that certainly were eligible to be refinanced out into the permanent non-recourse financing market",neg,train
"I won’t tell you that’s completely run its course, but I would say it has materially run its course, which allows for – been that organic growth and the coming behind that without that headwind",neg,train
"Yes, let me just mention, if you look at the $264 million number for the fourth quarter, it’s probably a little high relative to what you’ll see in the first quarter, because we are going to reclass about $10 million of DP expenses up to against one of our revenue line items under the new revenue recognition guidance",neg,train
"Perhaps most importantly, the stage is set for continued growth in the Wealth Management division",neg,train
But we have a great origination team that had a great year last year in terms of origination,neg,train
It was really the paydowns that were abnormally large that created the headwind,neg,train
"Turning to the Slide 11, operating expenses were $264 million in the quarter, down from $265",neg,train
"For the full year, expenses were up and modest 0",neg,test
"8%, in line with our original goal to keep expenses flat on a GAAP basis compared to 2016",neg,train
I think it’s really more about less refinance activity given our rate forecast,neg,train
"Even less than what we had in 2017 which obviously was down from previous years and pressure on the margin, especially within our consumer direct segment of mortgage",neg,train
So we would expect – we are expecting that threshold to move and so that’s got us thinking in terms of capital deployment perhaps a bit more aggressively than what we’ve been thinking in the past from an M&A perspective,neg,train
Five actually I think was the number that we acquired,neg,train
"So, I wouldn’t say that we are not still interested in that because we are",neg,train
"Our energy portfolio is in excellent shape and the portfolio has now improved for seven consecutive quarters since the first quarter of 2016, the trough of the energy downturn",neg,train
"First, as I noted earlier, we are seeing much stronger loan pipelines as a result of the passage of tax reform, the new production activity in our CRE group and the renewed momentum in the healthcare business",neg,train
Can you – to the extent you can touch a little bit on what happened there?,neg,train
"And so, if you look at us specifically, I think that just stabilizing commercial real estate now that we are well inside our internal concentration limits and have capacity to grow through 2018, I think that in and of itself really allows us to achieve our mid-single-digit kind of target that we have established for 2018, Peter",neg,train
issued debit cards which we felt was better reflected on the service charge line item,neg,train
The result is that the transaction card line item is now purely reflective of revenue associated with our trans funds transaction processing business,neg,train
"Personal loans were up 2% for the quarter or 8% annualized and 15% for the full year, which is indicative of the strength of our wealth management business and in particular, private banking, which Scott discussed",neg,train
"First, the prospects of healthcare reform muted growth in our healthcare portfolio in the first half of the year",neg,train
"Second, we experienced a wave of commercial real estate paydowns in the second half of the year due to a flattening yield curve which was coupled with lower production volume as we were mindful of not exceeding our internal concentration limits earlier in the year",neg,train
"And third, uncertainty around tax reform, which negatively impacted our general C&I and business making segments",neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray,neg,train
"I mean, since I’ve been here 20 years, I’ve – it’s ranged from 185 down to 110",neg,train
"So, I mean, who knows where we fall in that",neg,train
"But, I wouldn’t see that goes down to tremendous amount",neg,train
"Just going back to the – as you mentioned the sweet spot of where you playing CRE, can you just comment a little more broadly on the attractiveness of the different CRE segments, where you see the most value? Are there categories in CRE that you don’t want to play in whether it’s because of terms, conditions or spreads? Thanks",neg,train
This is why we were able to be committed to this business when other banks were running from it and benefit from the kind of loan growth we saw in 2017,neg,train
11 per share represents the second best year in our company’s history,neg,train
"As evidenced by the 2018 guidance that Steven just articulated, we are more optimistic about continued earnings growth in 2018 than we were at the end of the third quarter",neg,train
We are well positioned to benefit with the diverse set of products and services to meet the needs of the next generation,neg,train
"In the near-term, the increase in assets under management and fiduciary assets in 2017 should translate to higher trust fees in 2018",neg,train
This is one of the reasons we are more confident that we can deliver growth in fees and commissions in 2018 as Steven will discuss in a moment,neg,train
It’s good to see healthcare move back to its historical growth trajectory after the industry paused to wait for any potential impact of healthcare reform earlier in the year,neg,train
"I know it’s baked into your guidance for fee income growth of low-single-digits, but specifically in mortgage, how are you thinking about that for 2018? Do you think that there could be a little more downside to mortgage with lower volumes? Or do you think that 2018 should be more flat with the runrate in 2017?",neg,train
"The focus of our healthcare segment in large part is senior housing, skilled nursing, assisted living, memory care, et cetera",neg,train
3 million of our ordinary shares for a total configuration of $9 million,neg,train
"As of December 31, 2017, and since we began to repurchase our shares in August 2014, we had acquired an aggregate of 15",neg,train
8 million shares for an aggregate configuration of approximately $79,neg,test
We always thought when we did that that would be one of the best investments we would make for us with cash flow that we generated,neg,train
"But at the same time, maybe with the new Voice",neg,train
"Shabtai, I wanted to ask a question on your new business unit, the Voice",neg,train
It sounds like doing the math that was about $10 million – would have been about $10 million of revenue last year,neg,train
Just wondering what are the products today that comprise that revenue? And how do you think about the growth trajectory of that business and what’s some of the incremental products you might develop that would drive that growth? Thanks,neg,train
"It is very known that global communication remains one of the most effective masthead for complex and critical business transaction, yet most of the verbal communication is not recorded and is not converted into actionable insight that can help enhance business productivity",neg,train
"If you’d compare voice to data, anything that’s done with data today in the enterprise with emails, with file transfer, with other forms of data, it is all recorded, it can all be searched, it can all be utilized in order to perform various business processes",neg,train
"Revenues by geographical region for the quarter were split as follows: North America, 39%; Central and Latin America, 7%; EMEA, 41%; and Asia Pacific, 13%",neg,train
"Our top 15 customers in aggregate represented 63% of revenues in the quarter, of which 48% are attributed to our nine largest distributors",neg,train
So then – what – where – maybe we could ask the question differently then,neg,train
Service revenue growth versus product growth; how are you thinking about that? What is the service revenue growth expectation for 2018?,neg,train
"And just wanted to get a little more color on the Media Gateway market, it sounds like that’s nicely performed your expectations in 2017, and the driver there appears to be significant network transformation project",neg,test
"So just wanted to get your thoughts on that business in 2018, sounds like you’re expecting a similar trajectory which would be kind of, I guess, low to mid single-digit growth",neg,train
Is that a fair characterization of your expectations for Media Gateway?,neg,train
"Touching on the front of the SBC, 2017 has been a record year for SBC",neg,train
"We grew above 35% over the quarter the year ago and 20% from the previous quarter, so all in all, very strong performance for SBC",neg,train
I should make a note that almost 25% for SBC solution sold was implemented in [indiscernible],neg,train
So that leads to some improvement on our gross margins,neg,train
"On the Gateway front which represents also 45% of our business, we enjoyed good business in 2017",neg,train
Earlier in the year the plan for Gateways calls for a decline in revenues of about 5% compared to 2016,neg,train
I’m glad to say that we actually saw a reverse in the trend and that in fact revenues grew above 6% compared to previous year,neg,train
"Second is that to sell Session Border Controllers in the enterprise market, you need to partner with the application vendors",neg,test
"And there is another player there Oracle, we do not think that Oracle is playing a partnership game with our AI",neg,train
"So all in all, the environment in the enterprise space is really good for us",neg,train
"I just mentioned another one huge service provider that is operating in EMEA and then another is in where we won – in RFP it just was decided back end of 2017 which means we can expect another five, seven years of deployment of that product",neg,train
"So all in all I would say, again that the whole process is really in transit and we expect some very meaningful years ahead of us",neg,train
"Niran Baruch – Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
Greetings and welcome to the AudioCodes Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call,neg,train
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode,neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded",neg,test
"In fact, if I’ll just try to give you a new angle on articles, you can think now for the quarter, really comprising of two business units",neg,train
"One which is the traditional large, which you know its performance for many years that constituted at this stage above 97%, 98% of the business is our voice networking unit, and it is about $155 million in revenues, it has global footprint, it has large installed base of customers and partners, it is growing nicely, it is profitable and basically very dominant in growing revenues",neg,train
"Adlersberg, I’ll turn the floor back to you for any final comments",neg,train
"On the other hand we now have a new business unit that’s fairly young, quite advancing technology, but still very small in revenue",neg,train
"And as you can imagine we’ll have – going forward, we’ll have basically develop for ourselves a new growth engine for years to come",neg,train
If you look on AudioCodes history you’ll find that in the past 20 years or so AudioCodes has always been enable to reinvent itself every six or seven years,neg,train
"So we started this technology back in the 1990’s, we’re started the Gateway line back in 2002 and 2003",neg,train
"With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Shabtai Adlersberg",neg,train
With that I have ended my introduction and I will now turn the call back for the Q&A session,neg,train
And several of these are located in some very important network junctions that are being used to conduct internal and external communication of large companies,neg,train
"So all in all, we are very – as you can imagine very enthusiastic about this activity",neg,test
"And so when you’re selling this business you’re going to sell this to sort of like an overlay, analytics overlay",neg,train
I’m just wondering how you’re going to market this to your customers?,neg,train
"As usual, we will be referring to both GAAP and non-GAAP numbers on the call",neg,train
Today’s earning press release contains a reconciliation of supplemental non-GAAP financial information,neg,train
"And then just kind of looking on the Q1 side, I’m actually modeling it down just purely given the seasonality factor in the March quarter",neg,train
"Was there some pull in business, financial demand, how are you feeling starting the year? It sounds like you are upbeat given the guidance",neg,train
So what should the model for Q1 look like? Are we looking more of a flat quarter in March down quarter in March? Give us a sense of how we should be modeling it?,neg,train
"Well, the experience we have with the new current environment which is really driven by those all-IP projects",neg,train
"Indeed in 2007, we reversed from a plan of decline to actually finishing upward, and that is based on activity mainly in North America and mainly in Germany",neg,train
"As you can – and we’ve already seen in some other countries, some initial steps to move itself, the service provider and infrastructure to IP",neg,train
"Actually, basically the basis for the optimism we have is that SmartTAP is a recording solution is being sold for the past three, four years",neg,train
"We about to announce our compliances with a new standard, we’ve just made obligatory in 2017",neg,train
That allows us to access too many customers who already implemented SmartTAP as a good infrastructure for recording calls across the organization,neg,train
"In terms of the geo split, North America was the leading region with about 40%",neg,train
"But then we have lots of activity in West Europe, and we saw activity there above 30% of revenue",neg,train
"We have got products on the various fronts, on voice infrastructure, monetization of Skype for Business for service providers, managed services for service provider and then trunking and access in other area",neg,train
"In the past two years, I don’t have the data in front of me, but I think we grew definitely above 10%",neg,test
"We’ve seen a reason for the trends on the service side to change, but services are growing faster than products",neg,train
That may change when we start to grow our Voice,neg,train
"AI, where products are relatively young and the majority in revenues would be from product versus services",neg,test
"But all in all, for the networking unit services grow faster than products on the Voice",neg,train
"So, traditionally we have usually settled in a lower first quarter versus the fourth quarter",neg,train
"So in our budget and plans, I think would factored in about 2% or maybe 3% decline",neg,train
"The trends in generally point to a better quarter, so right now we still in the first week of January or second week, we’re not that active",neg,train
"So it still early to call on the quarter, but all in all, we definitely have good thoughts better than anticipated for the first quarter of 2018",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
We will definitely – we believe we should grow at least 15%,neg,train
"We see – well, the main business line in that category – as we see growth above 20%",neg,train
"We have few more alliance there including our business routers, the Microsoft cloud appliances, the phones, IP phones, and the management sales for us",neg,test
"So, all in all, I will not change guidance as to above 20%",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Netis with William Blair,neg,train
"Any company that would use new AI-based technology, it needs a reference database of calls that were recorded for a long time to come up with a new solution",neg,train
"So if you want to process your sales calls and/or you want to process your service calls and/or analyze meetings, you need to create a very deep and long database of recorded calls",neg,train
SmartTAP will allow you to record and make record those calls up for your AI before launching any AI application,neg,train
"So we will use SmartTAP, it’s a very efficient and installed based solution to upscale our business in Voice",neg,train
"Now coming back to some key points in our financials, Niran has mentioned most of the most important points",neg,test
"I’ll just point that last quarter was a very strong one, we grew almost 10% over the quarter a year ago, which tells you a bit about increasing growth rate of our business",neg,train
"We have exiled in terms of our operational performance, so operating margin include a first time 89",neg,train
"AI business basically impact on the main business you can assume that the main business, the voice networking unit, has performed in terms of operating margin above 10% quite nicely",neg,train
"As indicated previously, we have now become the partner of choice for CPE products in most of the leading all-IP and UC application environment, such as Microsoft Skype for Business and BroadSoft",neg,train
"And back to the enterprise side, is there any change from Cisco-BroadSoft combo? I mean, are there more aggressive, less aggressive? What are you seeing out of that combo?",neg,train
We know that voice is recorded and logged in contact centers for sales calls and sometimes also by companies for service calls,neg,train
"But all in all, we all know that a call on the phone with a business partner and/or internally could be a business review which is attended by 10 or 15 different people",neg,train
"At the end of that meeting very little of the conversation becomes effective, few action items are being generated, but it’s really most of the content, most of the contribution is lost",neg,train
And in 2017 we have closed another year of growth that’s about 15% annually,neg,train
"Crossing the $65 million of revenues in 2017 and continued growth of 15% annually in 2018 and 2019, should bring the UC-SIP business revenue close to $100 million in 2019",neg,train
"Right now, we do support all the different types of work in the Microsoft environment",neg,train
We also work very closely to become an early stage partner for Teams in connection with Microsoft effort to provide PSN trunking as the fee for service – provider services,neg,train
"Before I turn the call over to management, I’d like to remind everyone that the call is being recorded and an archived webcast will be made available on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website at the conclusion of this call",neg,train
"The call will also be archived on our Investor Relations app, which is available for free from the iTunes App Store and the Google Play market",neg,train
"So I look at the SBC, you have the record year end quarter, very strong obviously",neg,train
"What do you attribute this to? Was this more of a competitive environment changing? Vis-a-vis [indiscernible] or maybe Acme Packet, but anything you can tell us A, what drove the business trends and B what the competitive environment looks like would be good",neg,train
"That’s my – I said 30% to 40% but that’s my personal assumption, yes",neg,train
And then last question on the network transformation almost a bit of a follow-up to Rich’s question,neg,train
"The way I want to frame it is this way, how many network transmission projects, so maybe RFPs are out there",neg,train
"Is there a number or do you see that pace of these projects accelerating at this point in time? And what are you expose more toward either the Nortel DMS replacement or the Alcatel-Lucent 5ESS, where do you see you can have the best bang for your buck given the product you have?",neg,train
"Just on this annual guidance, I’m kind of following up on Rich’s question",neg,train
"I think if I hear you, you’re blessed to low mid single-digit growth on the Media Gateway front, implied in that guidance would be over 20% growth in UC-SIP",neg,train
Is that the expectation that the UC-SIP business will grow 20% in 2018?,neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms",neg,train
And just one more from me on the stock buyback,neg,train
You have been pretty consistent with buying back stock now for a while,neg,test
Is there any reason to think that would change in 2018?,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Now let me touch the announcement that we made yesterday,neg,train
"Now to some other business fronts, let me recap on Microsoft",neg,train
"In 2017 we have seen growth, although slower than in previous years",neg,train
"All in all, we grow in 2017 about 15% down from about 20% the year ago",neg,test
We have seen some very substantial increase in sales of products with the new emerging cloud online,neg,train
In fourth quarter 2017 we have not seen yet any impact on revenues,neg,train
"However, we have strong activity that’s plan to support the addition of voice in Teams",neg,train
"So understanding that that needs to be a world trend, but will take patient steps in many countries over the years, we have no reason to believe that we will see much change but we will have to go through 2018 to indeed assess whether that assessment to our debt assumption is true or not",neg,train
"Before beginning, we’d like to remind you that the information provided during this call may contain forward-looking statements relating to AudioCodes business outlook, future economic performance, product introductions and plans and objectives related thereto and statements concerning assumptions made or expectations as to any future events, conditions, performance or other matters are forward-looking statements as the term is defined under U",neg,train
North America is the most active in this network transformation process,neg,train
And that process is going on for a quite few years,neg,train
"We are working with several Dutch companies and we don’t see at this stage I think the process in North America has not crossed yet, I will say even in my mind even it’s 30% or 40% in terms of – the overall potential",neg,train
So we definitely working with some known names I’ve been mentioned in the past like Verizon and a few more operators,neg,train
"So to give you a better sense, first we operate in two different market segments, the enterprise and service providers",neg,train
"In the enterprise, we are sitting very well, the fact that we are dominant and leading on the Skype for Business front and Teams, and also on the contact center, which I haven’t mentioned so far, but the contact center has been very good for us",neg,train
And as we see it’s fairly an important product in that area,neg,train
Just to clarify you said that the penetration rate in that network transformation initiative that hasn’t quite crossed the 30% yet,neg,train
"To provide more color, as for the relative strengths in the Gateway business I’d note the following two examples",neg,train
Also in 2017 in December we announced that AudioCodes was selected by Thailand’s True Corporation for all-IP transformation,neg,test
"True in Thailand largest broadband internet provider, a leading mobile operator with tens of millions of subscribers, and the largest fixed-line phone operator in the Bangkok area",neg,train
"Also according to a latest market report from HIS, we keep gaining market share in the Gateway market as we become a consolidator in this space",neg,train
"Deferred revenues balance as of December 31, 2017, was $39",neg,train

"In November 2017, we received court approval in Israel to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of additional ordinary shares, pursuant to our share repurchase program",neg,train
"The current court approval for share repurchases will expire on May 27, 2018",neg,train
We continue to expect top line revenue growth and operating margin expansion in 2018,neg,train
"We expect revenues in the range of $166 million to $172 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0",neg,train
"Well, in fact both activities, VocaNOM and SmartTAP have been much more in a development status in the past few years",neg,train
"So while we have – and today we have about 40 people on both activities, most of it about 75% to 80% has been invested in technology development in R&D",neg,train
"We have added the activity regarding the AI and machine learning, and different networks in 2017",neg,train
"So we did much less in sales and right now we are just trying to go upwards, in fact, sales have not been hard, you will do $2 million to $3 million a year",neg,train
"We do expect though a growth of at least 80% to 100%, in fact, we may incur more growth, but that is just to tell you that we have – our Voice",neg,train
AI has been generating less revenues – the negative operating impact,neg,train
That means that our main business basically has a much better operating margin,neg,train
"In Germany, Germany is second country with much activity working with the telecom",neg,train
We are working with – in 2017 by the way we enjoyed much success I think we can count between six and eight different new service provider in Germany which are starting to work with us on that,neg,train
"We know this activity in France, in the UK, we’ve seen some in Switzerland",neg,train
"I’ve mentioned True from Thailand, it’s a representative of the large – a very large tens of millions of subscribers from Asia Pacific",neg,train
"But we know for a fact that in Asia Pacific that whole process is really being pushed more into the 2020, 2025 year",neg,train
"One important geographical aspect, in 2017 we grew significantly in EMEA as compared to other regions",neg,train
"Revenues in EMEA were about 27% of the company over revenue in the first quarter of 2017, enriched 39% in the fourth quarter of 2017, a jump of over 40% in course over the year",neg,train
In EMEA we see growing pipeline of opportunities brought to us by two very strong global system integrators,neg,train
In November we announced collaboration with SoftBank on Skype for Business,neg,train
"SoftBank, which is a leading Japanese telecom service provider, deploys AudioCodes products and solution and business customers part of using Skype for Business online office service",neg,train
I would like to welcome all to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call,neg,train
"With me this morning is Niran Baruch, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance of AudioCodes",neg,train
Niran will start off by presenting a financial overview of the quarter,neg,train
"I will then review the business highlights and summary for the fourth quarter and the full year 2017, and discuss trends and developments in our business and industry, and lastly outlook and guidance for 2018",neg,test
"At the end of December 2017 cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits and marketable securities totaled $58",neg,train
Day sales outstanding as of December 31 were 51 days,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company,neg,test
"In addition, we saw continued growth in network transformation projects conducted by Tier 1 service providers in several countries, most notably the U",neg,train
"These are projects intended to our businesses, transition from the old world of TDM to an all-IP world",neg,train
"Touching on an annual basis, so in 2017 we grew in revenue 7",neg,train
And if you compare 2015 to 2017 you can see that we have basically doubled earnings in two years,neg,train
"Gross margin great performance, we eat for the first time, 52",neg,train
"From some discussion we had, we have no sign that things are going to change dramatically",neg,train
"But again, we will have to live through that experience",neg,train
So all in all we don’t see much change on that front,neg,train
Our strategy of close collaboration with the market leaders in both segments and strong allies and relationship with large and global system integrators proved to be essential and quite effective in growing our revenues in this market segment,neg,train
"In parallel we enjoyed good business momentum in our service provider side of the business, where we see continued annual of SIP Trunking at the rate that’s above 20% across the regions",neg,train
"All in all, coming now to outlook and guidance, so outlook is very positive on our side, our main voice connectivity business is well on track with good position in the market",neg,train

"Reference guidance, as Niran mentioned, regarding revenue we now guide for a range $166 million to $172 million assuming current business trends continue we should aspire for 8% to 10% revenue growth over 2017, which will be a pickup from 2017",neg,train

"(NASDAQ:AUDC) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2018  8:00 AM ET",neg,train
I would like to welcome everyone to the AudioCodes Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call,neg,train
"Hosting the call today are Shabtai Adlersberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Niran Baruch, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"Regarding earnings, we expect to grow earnings above 20% in 2018 setting for the range of $0",neg,train
There is a much depends on the new Israeli shekel to U,neg,train
5 is not favorable and this is the basis for our guidance,neg,train
3 million in fourth quarter of 2017 and we have a program in place for another 3,neg,train
"5 months, and I assume that we will keep performing on this program",neg,train
This is the third year in a row that we generate above $17 million a year,neg,train
The one strong point is the OpEx front; headcount at the year end was 698 employees versus 703 by the end of the third quarter,neg,train
"However, we face strong headwinds on the currency front where the average conversion rates for the U",neg,train
"This is the main reason behind the pickup in OpEx for the fourth quarter, which is about $1 million compared to the previous quarter",neg,train
"In addition, during the call, AudioCodes will refer to non-GAAP net income and net income per share",neg,test
AudioCodes has provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income and net income per share to its net income and net income per share according to GAAP in its press release and on its website,neg,train
"On a non-GAAP basis, quarterly operating income was $4 million or 9",neg,test
"7% of revenues, compared to an operating income of $2",neg,train
Full year 2017 net income was $12 million or $0,neg,train
"On the service provider, which is on the company by the way on company scale, service provider is about 20% of our revenues",neg,train
"We have no play at all in the quarter as we see market which is usually competition varies between Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia",neg,train
"So we put singular emphasis on the access and cloud efficacy, so that gives you a feature",neg,train
We’re very pleased to report strong financial results and continued momentum for the fourth quarter and full year 2017,neg,train
"This financial result cast a very strong business momentum in the fourth quarter, and in fact for the second half of 2017",neg,train
I’m glad to say we see similar such continued trends in January this year,neg,train
"This is a 10th sequential quarter now, that’s our business momentum picks up fairly steady, all that since the second quarter of 2015 upon the impact of the global oil crisis",neg,train
I would like to thank everyone who attended our conference call today,neg,train
With good business momentum and execution of our plans in the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 we believe we are on track to achieving 2018 and the year of growth,neg,train
We look forward to ask you and to see you participate in our next quarterly conference call,neg,test
"Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated in such statements",neg,train
"As we look forward, we continue to expect to make investments in our commercial lending and banking teams, made key operational staff additions and enhance our core operating systems",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 17, we ended the quarter with tangible book value of $21",neg,train
"21, which represents 5% growth in our tangible book value, compared to $20",neg,train
"3% as of the end of the year, our regulatory capital ratios are strong at an estimated 10",neg,train
"Moving on to non-interest income on slide 15, non-interest income of $32",neg,train
3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $7,neg,train
6 million of losses on the sale of divestment securities taken as part of the company's treasury and tax management objectives,neg,test
9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $32,neg,train
"Third quarter was negatively impacted by a $4 million decrease in valuation of our mortgage servicing rights, whereas MSR valuation was relatively flat in the fourth quarter",neg,train
And the rate at which you are able to lock-in any change from when you kind of first disclosed the strategy? Did it get any better?,neg,train
"Dennis, so expenses up $7 million to $8 million from the core in the fourth quarter, so it implies somewhere in the road of call it $98 million or so in the first quarter",neg,train
"Can you talk a little bit about where you would anticipate they go afterward? I know you gave the efficiency ratio commentary for after the first quarter, but just I was hoping you might - I might be able to pin you down on like a dollar expectation for core expenses beyond the first quarter?",neg,train
"So most of my questions have been answered, but on the credit quality, I was looking at the nonperforming assets table, and saw that you had roughly $4 million increase in C&I and CRE in the non-accrual bucket and I was just wondering if you had any color or background on kind of what was the driver there?",neg,test
"Turning to slide nine, we had $322 million worth of loan growth in the fourth quarter, representing an annualized loan growth rate of 9",neg,train
3% compared to an annualized rate of growth in the third quarter of 4,neg,train
Loan growth for the quarter included strong growth in both commercial real estate and C&I lending,neg,train
"Just wanted to ask another question on the tax rate, you've got the guns for the effective rate of 18",neg,test
"7% what would that translate to on an FTE basis, I guess I am sort of back of the envelop and maybe couple percent higher",neg,train
"Is that a fair way to think of it so FTE would be in 21-ish% range, is that fair Dennis?",neg,train
And do you have a sense for the likely contribution of purchase accounting benefits this year,neg,test
"I think you had $32 million in 2017, where does that flush out in 2018, based on your expectations?",neg,train
As always we appreciate your time and interest in Chemical,neg,train
"And part of that also I guess when we merge companies together with the scale of the platform that we have, we also implemented behavior changes and activity changes within the organization with operating model especially on the retail side where we are focused on client engagement and product growth",neg,train
"So we are in year two of that, I was very impressed with the level of performance during the campaigns that we had during '17 and the design and like the design of the campaigns that we have as we head into '18",neg,train
"As shown on slide 14, our net interest income increased to $145",neg,train
The increase is primarily attributable to increases in average loans and investment securities,neg,test
"At our earnings call last quarter, I provided details on the steps we were taking to refine and clarify our overall strategic plan, of how we allocate our capital across the organization and to better position the company for growth",neg,train
"As we are now in the first quarter of 2018, we have completed our staff reduction, the consolidation of 25 branches in the fourth quarter in addition to the 13 we consolidated in the third quarter of 2017, discontinued our title insurance services and completed our reduction of resources to indirect auto lending",neg,train
"And then on the commercial real estate side, you had some pretty strong growth there, probably the strongest we've seen of the Midwest banks that have reported thus far this earnings season",neg,train
Can you talk about was this timing and what kind of CRE loans have you been putting on?,neg,test
"No, the new group has not contributed at all for the fourth quarter growth, that was our existing teams throughout the organization and just pipeline built throughout the year",neg,train
Dennis you talked about the expenses in the first quarter in your prepaid remarks and you said I think up maybe $7 million to $8 million in the first quarter,neg,train
3 million number that you highlight in the press release?,neg,train
"Net loan charge-offs decreased only 4 basis points on average loans in the fourth quarter, compared to 10 basis points in the prior quarter",neg,train
The charge-off rate for the full year 2017 was only 7 basis points compared to 11 basis points in 2016,neg,train
"Our ratio of non-performing loans to total loans increased to 45 basis points as of December 31, 2017, compared to 39 basis points as of the end of the third quarter and 34 basis points at the end of 2016",neg,train
In Q4 we jump significantly we were - if I remember correctly around $2,neg,train
8 million and it had only been - it was substantially less than that I think $0,neg,train
However we were over $2 million in the second quarter,neg,train
So we were just significantly down in the third quarter,neg,train
"With us today are David Provost, CEO and President of Chemical Financial Corporation, Thomas Shafer, Vice Chairman of the Chemical Financial Corporation and CEO of Chemical Bank, and Dennis Klaeser, Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
By quarter-end we had reinvestment of approximately $250 million of the proceeds from those sold securities,neg,train
"And by early this week, we successfully reinvested 100% of the proceeds from those securities that we sold",neg,train
"We estimate that we will earn back the securities losses in about five quarter, giving modestly higher yield on the new securities that we acquired in addition to the lower tax rate on the earnings going forward",neg,train
"Yes, a lot of it was timing, just action period for these transactions is a while there is also some construction funding has taken place at the end of the year",neg,train
"Some of this is there is a significant amount of owner occupied that was in there and I would say we are very focused on making sure that we are lending the high quality borrowers, high quality projects that can withstand the change both in interest rate environment and economic environment",neg,train
"So it's we are - and one of the reasons for the type of hires that we're making right now, both in marketplace and history is to continue to work on our mix",neg,train
"And then with the hires that you guys have made sense, I think you said 14 since October",neg,train
"Looking out the rest of the year, what's your pipeline like now and how many additional commercial bankers do you think you can bring in over the next several quarters?",neg,train
"After brief comments from management, the call will be opened for your questions",neg,train
I think how you are doing the calculation so it's 21%,neg,train
So the difference between the corporate tax rate 21% and the 18,neg,train
"7% is the combined impact of primarily municipal deposits, but we also get some continuing benefit from loan income housing tax credits that flow through there",neg,train
"And customer service fees are up about $900,000 linked quarter, what were the drivers of the increase?",neg,train
"Hi, how many of the planned hires in commercial banking will be in Grand Rapids?",neg,train
"The core increase in non-interest income was due to a variety of factors including strong increase in interest rate swap fee income related to our commercial lending business, and that's reported in the other line item",neg,train
We had stronger electronic banking fees and stronger wealth management revenue,neg,train
"This was all partially offset by the decrease in mortgage banking gain on sale revenue, which declined sequentially by about $1",neg,train
"On slide 10 you can see that our $322 million worth of net loan growth for the quarter is a result of $591 million of growth in our originated portfolio, offset by $269 million runoff of our acquired loan portfolios",neg,train
"Our net loan growth for the quarter primarily benefited from an increase in new loan originations, but we were also benefited by a slowdown in runoff of our acquired loan portfolio",neg,train
"We did some tweaking a variety of fees after Durbin and I don't really have the exact breakdown of that, but we some of our…",neg,train
"Yes, so first of all, during the quarter we sold $400 million and then by quarter end we reinvested $250 million of those",neg,train
So we're here early in the fourth quarter - early in the first quarter we added another $150 million,neg,train
So really for the most part beginning the year we are at - add $150 million to the year-end balances,neg,train
Please refer to the forward-looking statements disclaimer and the other information on pages two through three of the slide presentation for a description of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in forward-looking statements,neg,train
Dennis maybe I am interested if you could give us an update on the securities leverage size you with - that you have been putting given the moving rates,neg,train
How quickly should we be expecting the investment book to grow and any comments on yield pickup for period?,neg,train
We appreciate your time and interest in Chemical Financial Corporation,neg,train
"And then final question just on expectations regarding the margin and I think both, really it would be helpful if you can maybe give your outlook for the year for both the reported and then the core margin excluding purchase accounting benefit?",neg,train
We are very pleased with the quarterly results and the outcome from our restructuring efforts are clear,neg,train
"In addition to the improvement in our efficiency ratio, we produced high quality loan growth, while maintaining a stable net interest margin and hired additional commercial bankers",neg,test
So however being conservative on that and I hope I am being conservative on the yields that we are getting on the new loan production,neg,train
"The other thing that we're focused on is a bit of shift in the strategy of that business, because in 2017, we sold only about half of what - or less than half of what we produced",neg,train

"In that ballpark range again, we're going to be opportunistic",neg,train
And again we feel there is a great opportunity right now for us to build market share and capture market share,neg,train
Does the margin guidance that you gave take into consideration the impact of tax reform on the FTE margin?,neg,train
Maybe just a quick clarification on the efficiency guide that you talked about in the tax rate,neg,train
I think you said 15% tax rate with the kind of fully loaded with the tax credit amortization,neg,train
What's that predicated on in terms of expense? And is that expense in the sub-50 guidance or is that separate? Thanks,neg,train
"These efforts help drive a significant reduction in our operating expenses in the fourth quarter, which drove a significant increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0",neg,train
87 and resulted in an adjusted efficiency ratio improving to 47,neg,train
"So, of those 11 started in the end of the quarter",neg,train
And I think we had six or eight started in the first couple weeks of this quarter,neg,train
"While we are pleased with our overall results, we will continue to have a keen focus on ways to laying even strong foundation for continued growth in quarters ahead",neg,train
I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr,neg,train
"Yes, I was referring just rather core number excluding the charges related to historic tax credits, correct",neg,train
"As we discussed last quarter, a large portion of the savings we realized from our restructuring initiatives will be reinvested with a goal of sustaining strong growth over the longer term",neg,train
"I'm wondering Dennis, kind of the updated thoughts on capital mix and levels given the growth aspirations? Thanks",neg,train
"Looking forward our tax rate in 2018 excluding the impact of Federal Housing Income Tax credits, we expect the tax rate to be about 18",neg,train
"However, we had a number of historic tax credits in our pipeline",neg,train
"With these historic tax credits that are in our pipeline for 2018, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to drop to about 15%",neg,train
"Yes, in one of the charts we reflected as a contribution of basis points to the net interest margin, and it tick down just slightly third to fourth quarter to 22 basis points",neg,test
"And as we looks again sort of the baseline assumption is a very modest deterioration of that reduction of that over the course of the year, but I think we're still being fairly conservative in terms of our credit assumptions we've got are approximately 2",neg,train
"But yes, it's behaving more and more like our originated portfolio",neg,train
6 million losses on sale of investment securities taken as part of the treasury and tax management objectives included the sale of approximately $400 million of securities that had - where there was a loss position and they were so fairly late in the quarter when it was a near certainty that the tax reform bill was going to pass,neg,train
"On slide seven, net income excluding significant items was $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $8 million from the previous quarter and up $9 million from the same quarter a year ago",neg,train
"87 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, up from $0",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Yes, so in the first quarter, there is probably a couple of million dollars related to the seasonal uptick in payroll taxes",neg,test
"That then comes down in the third quarter, and the second quarter",neg,train
"So overall, probably relatively flat given the assumption that there is going to be some continued expense build with the growth of the company and growth of some of the additional hires that we're talking about",neg,train
I am especially pleased with our success in adding a number of new commercial bankers,neg,train
We have hired 14 new commercial bankers since our last earnings call,neg,train
"The majority of these senior bankers will be focused on driving C&I relationships in Southeast Michigan, Grand Rapids and Cleveland",neg,train
"Well I mean, all I did was removed most of the FTE adjustment from the FTE NII and taxes as well",neg,train
"I think historically you have maybe 300 basis points gap between the effective tax rate and the FTE tax rate? So, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out what the FTE tax rate expectation would be within the context of an 18",neg,test
"And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr",neg,train
"It is important to remind you that our comments that we made last quarter that while restructuring efforts are producing about $20 million worth of annualized savings, and more of these savings will be invested in hiring of additional commercial lenders and other bankers in key markets, as well as additional key management and operation staff to support customer service enhancements",neg,train
The impacts of these investments will begin to be evident in the first quarter of 2018,neg,train
"So, Dennis how much of the loan growth in the fourth quarter came from Southeast Michigan versus Grand Rapids in your other markets?",neg,train
"In addition to the investments in additional hires, we will see increases in spending related to the conversion of our core operating system that has now targeted for implementation in July of 2018",neg,train
Net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 3,neg,train
Interest accretion from purchase accounting discounts on acquired loans contributed 22 basis points to the net interest margin in fourth quarter compared to 23 basis points in the third quarter of 2017 and 14 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
And we're focused on the quality of growth and the composition of the growth,neg,train
And we talked before about our intension to have a mix shift in overall growth,neg,train
"So in past quarters, consumer lending including auto lending added a fair amount of growth, but going forward, the growth is going to be driven primarily we believe by commercial lending, which we believe will help - overall help margin and overall help ROE",neg,train
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by",neg,train
Welcome to the Chemical Financial Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call,neg,test
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
"Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time",neg,train
And then full year I guess we'd be talking about somewhere in the neighborhood of like $390 million or so in core expenses,neg,train
If you just stayed flat with the anticipated first quarter run rate is that a fair approximation?,neg,train
"The increase in non-performing loans as a percentage of loans at December 31, 2017, compared to the year ago was primarily due to previously accruing commercial trouble debt restructuring loans that were downgraded to non-accrual status",neg,train
And I think you addressed the other one - other question I had with the swap comment from the last question,neg,train
"Yes, Terry I'll touch on the branch closures and effect on deposits",neg,train
"So measuring the deposits that we had during the third quarter when we closed 13 branches tracking those relationships with new branches, we virtually lost no relationships in that process",neg,train
There was one relationship that moved for non-reasons had nothing with branch closure,neg,train
But our retail transactions in commercial relationships migrated to the new branches and our retail and commercial teams did an outstanding job of maintaining those relationships,neg,train
"It's too early to talk about the fourth quarter, but I expect similar results, we closed those at the end of the quarter and will keep - we're keeping close track of that right now",neg,train
Keys to our success in driving future earnings involve revenue growth and disciplined expense management,neg,train
We believe the recent efforts we have taken have positioned us for future success,neg,train
We are pleased with the level of quality loans we have originated in the quarter and have in our pipeline to produce another high quality loan growth quarter ahead,neg,train
"There is a correlation there with the market, so we do get a bit of a tailwind from more assets under management",neg,train
Second quarter is always a seasonally strong quarter because we do a lot of tax services for some of our clients,neg,test
"And a question on 4Q commercial loan growth, the new teams that were hired in the fourth quarter, were they up and running and did they contribute to any of that $168 million of C&I growth?",neg,train
"With that, let me turn it over to Dennis, to go through the financial results in further detail",neg,train
"As shown on slide eight, year-over-year our total loan portfolio has grown by $1",neg,train
"2 billion as of December 31, 2017 or a year-over-year growth rate of 9%",neg,train
The overall composition of our loan portfolio has remained relatively similar to a year ago with 60% of our loans to commercial borrowers and 40% to consumer borrowers at the end of the fourth quarter,neg,train
"And then on my last question on the wealth management fee line item that was up nicely, how should we think about that line item in 2018?",neg,train
I guess could you talk about any deposits attrition given some of the branch closures,neg,train
"And then thinking about 9% to 10% loan growth in '18 possibly better, how are you planning on funding the loan growth given that deposit growth has been trending about half of that in recent years?",neg,train
The improvement in our efficiency ratio was due to the reduction in our operating expenses as a result of our restructuring efforts,neg,train
"With the increase in operating expenses, in the first quarter we expect our efficiency ratio to move backup over 50% and then we expect it to trend back down below 50% by the latter part of 2018",neg,train
I will now turn it back to David for some closing remarks,neg,test
"5% at least by year-end and depending on the interest rate environment, we could grow it more aggressively",neg,train
So that would suggest $600 million to $700 million at least growth in the securities portfolio and hopefully a bit stronger than that,neg,train
And that growth probably is concentrated more in the early part of the year,neg,train
"As seen on slide 16, core operating expenses including merger and restructuring expenses and impairments associated with historic tax credits realized during the quarter or excluding those items were $91",neg,test
The quarter-over-quarter decline in our core operating revenues was reflective of the impact of the restructuring in our core operating expenses will reflect to the impact of our restructuring efforts that began in the third quarter of 2017,neg,train
I'm not sure how you are doing your calculation so…,neg,train
Obviously we feel that that the charge we took for DTA we'll build that back pretty quickly because of increased profitability because of lower tax rates,neg,test
9% total risk based capital I talked before about how that ratio is the one we're sort of more sensitive to in terms of the regulatory capital ratios,neg,train
"And then just a last question big picture, it's been about five quarters since the merger was closed there were some changes in management that led to some questions",neg,train
"But a number of them would be, but I don't want to specifically break it down by geography where we're hiring",neg,train
Chemical would like to remind you that a copy of today's earnings release can be accessed by logging onto chemicalbank,neg,test
com and selecting the investor info tab at the top of the website,neg,train
Also included is a slide presentation on our investor info page with supplemental information that will be referenced in today's call,neg,train
"Yes, most of it was - is Dennis talked about TRs that moved to nonperforming",neg,train
They are very granular in size there is a couple that we've been watching for a number of quarters,neg,train
So there is - and we're viewing this with our credit group and markets,neg,train
This is I think very manageable change we'll work it down from here,neg,train
"Yes, so we had - as a percent I don't have that",neg,test
"When I take a look at the goals, that we had for each of the marketplaces the areas that we had growth initiatives and we hit our objectives during the fourth quarter and for '17",neg,train
"All of these things combined are expected to result in a sequential increase in operating expenses in the range of $7 million or $8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017",neg,train
There is - I'm looking at the list of those,neg,train
And believe that we're well collateralized and have full understanding of the situation,neg,train
"We will now move on to our next question, caller please go ahead, your line is now open",neg,test
"Looking at our overall funding on slide 12, our average cost of funds increased to 56 basis points during the fourth quarter compared to 53 in the prior quarter and 33 basis points one year earlier",neg,train
"The increase in cost to funds compared to the third quarter was primarily due to increases in rates associated with our short-term FHLB borrowings, which have been primarily utilized to fund growth in our investment securities and loan portfolios, and an increase in rate on savings and time deposits due to the rising rate environment",neg,train
On that note moderator let's open the call up for questions,neg,train
"Moving on to deposits, as you can see on slide 11, our average deposit base increased slightly in the fourth quarter 2017, while period-end balances declined primarily due to seasonal decreases in municipal deposits",neg,train
Our average cost of deposits was 42 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to 38 basis points in the third quarter and 27 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
The tax benefits which dollar-for-dollar reduce the taxes we pay is a little bit more than $12 million for the full year,neg,test
"And in the first quarter of this year, we're going to have impairment charge right now based on the expected timing of these historic tax credits",neg,train
We have $2 million impairment charge offset by approximately $2 million tax benefit,neg,train
And that's going to be about little more than double that in the second quarter,neg,train
Any other particular line items we should be keeping an eye on that would in particular accelerate enough that we could expect to see that improved efficiency ratio back down below 50% starting in the second quarter?,neg,test
And will allow us to deliver on the goals that were established as part of the Chemical Talmer merger,neg,train
The provision for loan losses on originated loans was $8,neg,train
"1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which reflects increased organic loan growth in the quarter",neg,train
"For the quarter we are able to relief $579,000 of reserve for one of the pools of our acquired loan portfolios",neg,train
So our net loan loss provision in our income statement was $7,neg,train
"And then a follow-up to that, you've talked about loan growth targeting around 10% on an annualized basis",neg,train
What should we be looking at for 2018? Is that still the case or through the hires seems to be running a little bit higher than at least what I was expecting,neg,train
So do you think you'd be in the low double-digits with loan growth then?,neg,train
"Yes, so the margin really in the past two quarters has behaved better than I expected and I think the reason why is because we are getting little bit better yields on the new loan production than I expected",neg,train
"Additionally, our betas on deposits continues to be fairly low",neg,train
In our sort of base budget we are assuming betas are going to be substantially higher in 2018 and as a result of that we do see some modest pressure over the course of the year,neg,train
And as you know predicting what the betas are going to be is a - is very difficult to do,neg,train
"Yes, which is some of our ATM fees really rationalized all of our cost that we were - fees that we had never - some changes associated with the earnings improvement project in the third quarter, but we'll have to get that for you",neg,train
"So, impacting relatively neutral to the net interest rate position, but adding that minimum spread of about 1",neg,train
"So again, it creates cosmetic compression of the overall NIM, but yet it helps my net interest income",neg,test
"And based on the growth of retained earnings overtime, we are not - we don't feel pressure to issue equity right now",neg,train
"But when we get to a point, where either because of growth being very strong and or there being some acquisition in the future",neg,train
"But again we don't have anything planned in the short-term horizon, but that potentially could be something we'll be doing later this year",neg,train

"Obviously the efficiency ratio, we're not able to calculate in the offsetting tax benefit",neg,train
"But over the course of the year, the total impairment charges related to the historic tax credits is approximately $13 million or an after tax equivalent of about $10 million",neg,train
And that does conclude today's Chemical Financial Corporation earnings conference call,neg,train
"Thank you, the rest of my questions have been answered",neg,test
"I realize it was a long answer, but you kind of asked a big question",neg,train
"Yes Mike, I would just chime in - there are a couple but they’re relatively modest",neg,train
"Jude had a battery recall in the fourth quarter of last year which suppressed that baseline a bit, and we had a little bit of timing in EPD, but other than that, that’s about it",neg,train
Our organic growth would be around 7% this quarter - really strong,neg,train
"Jude, as you all remember it, it went through about a four or five-year period where it didn’t have much growth and the street was unhappy with that, and it even missed its earnings targets a couple of times",neg,train
"What they were right about was they had a robust R&D pipeline and a product pipeline, and they were right about that and I think the people that led and managed St",neg,train
"We do, because there was a fair amount of concern and criticism when we acquired St",neg,train
"It’s significant, and I’m really happy with the performance of St",neg,train
"Unless otherwise noted, our 2017 commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St",neg,train
"Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, the current year and historical results for Abbott’s medical optics and St",neg,train
"Jude’s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of last year, as well as the current year sales for Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017",neg,train
Jude’s historic sales related to administrative fees paid to Group Purchasing Organization in order to conform with Abbott’s presentation,neg,train
"In summary, 2017 was a very good year for us",neg,train
"We performed well, our new product pipeline was highly productive, and we took some very important strategic steps forward which yielded both immediate results and strengthened our long-term growth opportunities",neg,train
"We’re entering 2018 with very good momentum, we’re more diverse and better balanced, our leadership positions are stronger, and importantly a significant number of recent and upcoming product launches position us for strong growth in 2018 and beyond",neg,train
"Well, thank you, Operator, and thank you for all your questions",neg,train
A replay of this call will be available after 11:00 am Central time today on Abbott’s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor,neg,train
"com and after 11:00 am Central time via telephone at 404-537-3406, pass code 8277348",neg,train
The audio replay will be available until 10:00 pm Central time on February 7,neg,train
"Hey, two quick questions me as well, and both are for Brian",neg,train
"Does any of that fall to the bottom line, or is that completely hedged away - question one",neg,train
"Then number two, the lower tax rate for this year, is this a sustainable new run rate for the next couple years? Thanks",neg,train
"Yes Joanne, as you recall, we launched first in deep brain stimulation products in the fourth quarter of last year, to Miles’ point",neg,train
Obviously the business is coming off a great year - we’re number one now in the chronic pain segment,neg,train
The market is growing in the low teens and we expect to grow faster than that,neg,train
Today I’ll discuss our 2017 results as well as our 2018 outlook,neg,train
"We integrated and achieved our synergies, expect that to continue, and that’s incorporated into our guidance",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference",neg,train
This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only",neg,train
Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan,neg,train
"As we look at the overall $30 billion global nutrition market, we see a market that remains attractive",neg,train

"Then, I finally look at the whole cardiovascular device area",neg,train
"Jude was really growth, and there was a lot of grumbling a year ago about that acquisition",neg,train
"2% in the third quarter, and 10% in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"I won’t tell you that I think 10% is sustainable for the year, but they had a 10% fourth quarter and they didn’t have to stretch to do it, and the product launches and approvals, mainly the product approvals particularly in the U",neg,train
"that I forecasted to you in both July and October, all happened, and there was some skepticism about that because of the situation in Somar but, frankly, our team has done a terrific job in Somar and a terrific job communication with our U",neg,train
"regulators, and we got all those product approvals and those launches are all out of the blocks and going well",neg,train
So our challenges aren’t so much fixing problems or deficiencies; our challenges are how fast we can scale and how fast we can run,neg,test
"I’m pretty confident that it’s sustainable and it’s sustainable for a long time because it is organic growth of new products, so I’m pretty happy about that",neg,train
"I’m not out looking for M&A and I don’t have any significant M&A on the radar screen - in fact, I don’t have any M&A on the radar screen because I want to hit those debt targets by year-end",neg,train
"I want to get back to where our capital allocation flexibility is as flexible as it’s ever been, and I want to get their fast and I’m going to get there fast",neg,train
I’ll now provide a brief overview of our 2017 results and 2018 outlook for each business,neg,train
All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call,neg,train
"During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star, one key on your touchtone phone",neg,train
"Should you become disconnected throughout this conference call, please redial the number provided to you and reference the Abbott earnings call",neg,test
The good news is we’ve got so many other opportunities at the same time that I think it’s nicely staged,neg,train
"You don’t want everything to show up at the same time, so I think it’s nicely staged to help sustain the growth in diagnostics while they're dealing with the scale-up of Alinity",neg,train
"side, you asked about the price, and I would just say we’ve never historically really relied on price",neg,train
"It’s about volume, and we had a great year in our pediatric business in the U",neg,train
", and that’s all about share capture in the infant milk formula market part of the pediatric business, with innovations that we introduced, and we want to continue staying to be a share leader there",neg,train
"But also, bright spots there in that pediatric portfolio are Pedialyte and Pediasure, which also have done quite well in the U",neg,train
The food safety law took effect in China on January 1,neg,test
"I’d say in terms of the happy column, a lot of our success right now and what we’re focused on is organic growth",neg,train
"We’ve never had such productivity out of R&D at Abbott, and frankly so has St",neg,train
Jude had said about their pipeline to the street over a number of years is true - they had and do have a terrific pipeline of products,neg,train
"We’ve gotten the approvals, we’ve closed the gaps where they had deficiencies, and there’s a lot of growth there, so what I’m particularly happy about is that the organic growth opportunity here across all of our businesses - nutrition, EPD, pharma business, the new product launches in diagnostics and devices, including St",neg,train
"Jude and Alere, it’s just--its broad and it’s deep, and it’s exciting to have that much innovation and new product to be launching",neg,train
"Before I review our outlook for the P&L, I’d note that we’ve reclassified certain pension-related items in order to comply with recent changes in pension accounting standards",neg,test
"As a result, approximately $150 million of net pension-related income has been removed from operating lines of the P&L, primarily cost of goods sold and SG&A expense, and now will be reported as non-operating income",neg,train
"With that in mind, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses",neg,test
5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 30,neg,train
This forecast includes the net interest impact of $4 billion of debt that was repaid earlier this month as well as anticipated additional debt repayments throughout 2018,neg,train
"We forecast a gain of approximately $5 million on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L for the full year 2018, and around $110 million of non-operating income which includes, as mentioned earlier, pension-related net income in accordance with the recent changes in accounting guidelines",neg,train
"tax reform and our forecasted mix of global income, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 14",neg,train
"Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of a little below 2% on our full year reported sales with more than half of this favorable impact driven by strengthening of the euro",neg,test
"As we’ve discussed previously, when the euro moves, the fall through impact on our results is modest, taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs",neg,train
"Then the other one I wanted to ask about was just back on Freestyle Libre, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you’re bringing on 50,000 new customers, I believe you said a month",neg,train
"I’ll start with nutrition, where sales grew low single digits in the fourth quarter, reflecting a modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter",neg,train
", growth this quarter was balanced across our pediatric and adult businesses",neg,train
"In pediatric nutrition, growth was led by Pediasure and Pedialyte, and in adult nutrition growth was driven by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands",neg,train
"Internationally, while much has been discussed regarding market dynamics in China, particularly the evolving regulatory environment and ongoing channel dynamics, I’d note that we’ve continued to see improving market conditions there",neg,test
"As expected, the new food safety regulations went into effect in that country at the start of this year",neg,train
We were well prepared for this change and the market is in the early stages of transitioning to new products,neg,train
"Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2",neg,train
"In terms of our 2018 sales forecast, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis",neg,train
"On this basis, our 2017 sales baseline would be $26",neg,train
"7 billion, which excludes sales from Alere, or rapid diagnostics as we call it, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, and also excludes sales from our former medical optics and vascular closure businesses, which we sold during the first quarter of 2017",neg,train
"So for the full year 2018, we forecast organic sales growth of 6 to 7%",neg,train
"In addition, we expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion for the full year 2018",neg,train
"And the confidence in the 2018 outlook, Miles, that the 6 to 7%, which I think if you would have surveyed the street before, they would have said you guys would have said mid-single digits, so obviously this is at the upper end or more bullish than that, is it the momentum that you’re seeing particularly in the device side of the business, and could you speak specifically to a couple of product launches? One of them I think everybody would like to hear about is Libre; another one is Confirm, which our check suggests is off to a very nice launch",neg,train
It’s a mass market product and it’s unlike any other medical devices,neg,train
"Medical devices by nature are sort of niche therapies - this one is not, and this one has a totally different rhythm to it, and the pace of scale and the magnitude of opportunity is more like tech than it is med-tech",neg,train
"So I mean, as challenges go, that’s a pretty nice set of challenges",neg,train
"As my follow up, neuromodulation sales were up 30% in the quarter after being up 50% for the beginning portion of the year",neg,train
"How do we think about that growth going forward, and there was a lot of good buzz coming out of NANS",neg,train
Our final question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America,neg,train
"We don’t want to think about it so incrementally, because I think sometimes when you’ve got these new products and opportunities, you’ve got to go hard and fast, and I think when you do that, you establish a better share position, a better market position, a better use position with customers, regulators, etc",neg,train
"So as you ask me, I think if we get our job done particularly in the areas where we just--you know, that I’ve just highlighted, which is a lot, I think our growth rates are pretty sustainable",neg,train
"In diabetes care, sales grew 28% in the fourth quarter led by Freestyle Libre, our highly differentiated glucose monitoring system",neg,train
"Over the course of last year, we also achieved a number of important regulatory and reimbursement milestones for Libre",neg,train
"Notably in North America, we received regulatory approvals in the U",neg,test
"On the reimbursement front, we obtained national coverage in the U",neg,train
", France and Japan, and earlier this month we announced that Freestyle Libre obtained Medicare coverage in the U",neg,train
"If I look at the underlying performance of the business and in different segments, and I’ll just recap some of this, the drag on some of the growth here has been in nutrition, and even that is sequentially improving",neg,train
"The situations that we’ve seen that have set that business back a little bit have all improved and are all improving, so I think first of all, that’s a good omen",neg,test
"Yes, I’m going to have Scott help me with that, but--because I asked the same thing",neg,train
"Scott can give you a little color on that, but the growth rate here remains strong and the opportunity remains strong",neg,train
"This is one of the bright--well, we’ve got a lot of bright spots, but this is one, clearly",neg,train
"Yes, I would just say, look, we launched pretty much right at the end of the year",neg,train
Obviously there was very modest sales in the fourth quarter number there,neg,train
"Without giving a number, I would say the strips are basically tracking right with our expectations",neg,train
"I think Miles had mentioned a quarter or so back when asked what a reasonable estimate for year one sales would be, and it was agreed upon it’d probably be in the $50 million to $100 million range, and that’s still where we sit today",neg,train
Then I think the story in the adult is we knew we had some adjustments to make,neg,train
"On today’s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott’s ongoing business performance",neg,train
"These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott",neg,train
"We start every year with a double digit earnings growth target, and as we’ve indicated this year on an apples-to-apples comparable growth basis, we expect 6 to 7%, and I’m in the upper half of that range in my beliefs",neg,train
I’m not concerned about having a double digit earnings growth rate on a sustainable basis for the next few years,neg,test
"I want to drive the top line so that I can sustain that at an even higher rate, and that’s where my focus is",neg,test
I’d like to apologize here at the start for the late start - we had a few difficulties with the phone connection,neg,train
"With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail,neg,train
"Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions",neg,train
"For the full year 2017, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2",neg,train
Strong performance across many of our businesses enabled us to achieve adjusted earnings per share well above the midpoint of the initial guidance range that we shared at the beginning of last year,neg,train
We’ve gained some share back in adult - that’s nice to see,neg,train
"At this point, as Brian said, we’re not relying on price",neg,train
"I think there’s a clear value proposition to be marketed out there, and we haven’t tried to stretch that, nor will we",neg,train
"So you know, knock on wood - I looked into 2018 and it all feels remarkably strong and sustainable, and I think that’s terrific",neg,train
"Tax reform was a nice boost, and there’s a lot of things here that are all looking up",neg,train
I think you estimated at one point $50 million to $100 million in the U,neg,train
this year - I think that’s a good range of estimate,neg,train
"We’re adding probably 50,000 customers a month right now and that’s increasing, and that was primarily Europe",neg,train
"You know, I think--I don’t think the 14% we saw in the fourth quarter is something we expect every quarter",neg,train
"I think it’s easily sort of 9 to 11% on a very sustainable basis on the sales line, so a lot of that is fundamentally in the markets and then we’re pressing to kind of broaden our product lines and gain share because of the way we manage the business",neg,train
"On Alere, I’d say our team has done a terrific job",neg,train
"We have an entirely new, from Abbott, management team there",neg,train
"I’d say their progress in terms of integration, reorganization, etc",neg,train
I’d say that our assumption of the business has gone at warp speed and gone well,neg,train
"We’re ahead of schedule on literally everything, on target on our synergies",neg,test
"have aided that to some degree, but thus far I’d say everything is sort of on point as we’ve projected",neg,train
Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
"Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2018, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0",neg,train
"In terms of our 2018 first quarter sales forecast, please note that the first quarter 2017 organic sales baseline would be $6",neg,train
"15 billion which, as we commented earlier, excludes sales from our former medical optics and vascular closure businesses which we sold during the first quarter of last year",neg,train
"On this basis, we forecast organic sales growth of 6 to 7%",neg,train
"In addition, we expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $5 million in the first quarter",neg,test
"At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a positive impact of around 3",neg,train
"We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment around 7",neg,train
"5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 33% of sales",neg,train
"Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $200 million in the first quarter",neg,train
"Miles, there’s a lot of conversation this morning on growth, but it was fairly robust EPS guidance for Abbott to start the year",neg,train
"I think for us, what’s interesting is unlike a lot of your peers who are dropping through all the tax down to the bottom line, you’re reinvesting, which makes sense given your premium growth",neg,train
"But I wonder if you can sort of give us a sense of where that reinvestment is going, and given your flexibility, how you’re feeling about this sort of mid-teens EPS growth over the next couple of years",neg,train
"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2017  9:00 AM ET",neg,train
"While we were adding these pieces, we sold AMO, our medical optics business",neg,train
"It hadn’t been invested in, so I think pipelines are going to take a little longer to develop",neg,train
"I think restoring the cohesiveness of performance of functions in the business, in some of the business, it’s going to take a little longer",neg,train
"We do have some rationalization to do - that doesn’t mean restructuring, that means the integration of those functions and businesses, and figuring out what are old products, what are new products and so forth",neg,train
Can we turn a little bit to EPD? That area of growth tends to be a little bit of a black box for investors,neg,train
How do we think about the sustainability of that growth rate? This is the second quarter in a row of mid-teens growth,neg,train
Well nice try - I don’t give guidance that far ahead,neg,train
"I have seen that a number of companies have dropped through quite a lot of tax benefit to the bottom line, and frankly I expect to see that",neg,train
"I mean, there are some industries and some businesses that really benefited from tax reform",neg,train
If the primary source of your sales and profits is the U,neg,train
"If you’re a multi-national or you had a lot of debt or something, it’s not as demonstrative; but now having said that, we’ve dropped through some of that tax benefit into our EPS, and I think that’s reflected in our guidance this morning",neg,train
"As you plan a year, we all can calculate what we believe our tax reform impact is going to be given our geographic mix and so forth, as you know, and then there’s exchange",neg,train
"If you’re a multi-national, you’ve got a lot of currencies to deal with",neg,train
"The exchange happens to us a lot of times, so we try to prepare for that with hedges",neg,train
"Lastly, I’ll cover medical devices, where sales grew nearly 10% in the fourth quarter led by strong growth in electrophysiology, heart failure, structural heart, neuromodulation, and diabetes care",neg,train
"Jude was truly a game changer for us, instantly transforming us into a broad-based medical device leader with scale, presence, and a great pipeline of next-generation products",neg,train
One area in particular that shined this past year was our new product productivity,neg,train
"As I mentioned earlier, the range we got was 14",neg,train
"I’d just note that regulations are still being formed, interpretations are ongoing, but from where we sit today, we believe we should generally be in the same ballpark of this range and we’ll provide further updates as we learn more too, as the tax laws unfold here",neg,train
"We’ve still got improvement to make in nutrition, and we know that and our nutrition team knows that",neg,train
"We’ve had a lot of discussion about that - I’ve personally talked to our (indiscernible) around the world and so forth, and there’s no point in having your (indiscernible), we simply want to do better",neg,train
"I’d say even where our growth rates are right now, sequential improvement is a plus",neg,train
"Now, there are a number of places we’re pretty positive and pretty happy with performance",neg,train
"There’s a number of countries around the world executing well, and the ones that had difficulty are improving, so that remains a point of attention to us",neg,train
"Moving to diagnostics where we’ve consistently achieved above-market growth with our leading platforms in core laboratory, molecular and point of care testing, the fourth quarter was no exception with sales growth of nearly 7%",neg,train
"This past year was important for this business on two fronts: first, the addition of Alere expands our presence in one of the few areas in diagnostics where we weren’t already a leader, the highly attractive rapid diagnostics market",neg,train
"Over the past few months, the team has made good progress integrating this business and we continue to see several levers for growth acceleration, including opportunities for geographic, platform and test menu expansion",neg,train
"We initiated the launch last year in Europe and will launch in additional geographies, including the U",neg,train
This highly differentiated platform promises to be a significant sustainable growth driver for this business over the coming years,neg,train
"It’s terrific to have access to it, I have to say",neg,train
"As a multi-national and a company that had a lot of debt in the last two years because of the acquisitions, I had concerns about some of the structures they were looking at, but it all turned out pretty good",neg,train
I think it will stimulate a lot of growth and investment in the U,neg,train
"You know, Joanne, I think the fundamentals underlying the markets drive an awful lot of the growth",neg,train
"You know, the managers in that business and I sort of have this ongoing debate - I’m always chronically dissatisfied and they’re always telling me, hey look, we’re really growing fast here",neg,train
"So the underlying fundamentals of those markets are all very positive in terms of growing healthcare systems, growing middle class, spending on healthcare, etc",neg,train
", but succeeding in those markets requires a certain amount of presence and strength and scale, meaning you want to be in the top five competitors in most of these markets",neg,train
"China is a little different, but you want to be in sort of the top five competitors",neg,train
"You want to have very broad product lines and you want to have some depth in various therapeutic categories, and you want to have a strong brand",neg,train
"Yes, I’ll tell you, look - the forecast we put out, it’s a strong forecast",neg,train
"It just is, I mean relative to peer groups, competitors, segments, the whole thing, and even relative to us",neg,train
"I don’t know the unknown, I don’t know what exchange may or may not do - that’s always unpredictable, but based on everything we know at this point, my view is yes, 6 to 7, and probably closer to the high end of that",neg,train
"With the exception of any participant’s questions asked during the question and answer session, the entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott",neg,train
It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott’s written permission,neg,train
"One follow-up - this is probably the most pleased I’ve heard you sound in while on how things are going and the results kind of speak for themselves, but I know you’re never satisfied",neg,train
"We will - I won’t tell you where or what products and so forth, because I don’t want to forecast that to competitors and so forth, but in fact the U",neg,train
"will benefit, as will some locations overseas where we’ve got already existing capability, facilities, expertise, etc",neg,train
"Just so you guys know, the sound quality isn’t great on our end, so just FYI",neg,train
"Miles, I did want to ask you about capital allocation and the benefit of tax reform",neg,train
Tax reform is going to lower your overall tax rate in 2018 by 150 to 200 basis points,neg,train
"Can you just talk about what you plan to do with the trapped cash and then how the access to global cash flows changes at all your capital allocation plans? And then I’ll drop, thanks",neg,train
"Secondly, in all the other areas, take EPD, very sustainable growth",neg,train
They had a very strong fourth quarter - I think it was 14%,neg,train
"I don’t expect 14 for the whole year ’18, but let’s face it - they’re running strong",neg,train
"Then I look at diagnostics and devices and they’ve both got just a tremendous bunch of new product launches, and they’re not flash in the pan product launches",neg,train
These are going to sustain growth over a number of years because these are big and broad product launches,neg,train
"The Alinity product launch, I think is going to make a big, significant difference in diagnostics",neg,train
I think we’re going to see increasingly better performance out of Alere,neg,train
"But look, Alinity is across six segments of diagnostics, so I think that’s a pretty sustained momentum",neg,train
"They’ve been doing a terrific job, frankly, in the 6 to 8% growth range with a lot of, I’d say, aging systems and older systems, and now they’ve got an entirely brand-new product line out there in all categories, so I think that bodes well",neg,train
I’ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2017 results and 2018 outlook in more detail,neg,train
"As always, it’s early in the year, so we’re reluctant to necessarily flow what’s through there",neg,train
"We know we have the hedge there, so we have a modest impact from the sales I quoted",neg,train
"You know, I think Miles has said this before - let’s see how things go",neg,train
There’s a lot of events that we watch throughout the year,neg,train
"As I said, it’s not an niche product - it’s a mass market product, because there are tens of millions of Type 1 diabetics, and frankly the same in Type 2s trying not to be Type 1 diabetics, and I’m one of them, so I wear the product, I live the product, I know the product, and I think this product has a long track road ahead of it",neg,train
So as I look at all the growth drivers of the company and then some of the elements of St,neg,train
"Jude, like neuromodulation and structural heart and other things, I think there is just an awful lot of growth here",neg,train
"Brian Yoor - Executive Vice President, Finance, Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"First of all, it’s six different systems, two in particular that are in the core laboratory, one that will address transfusion, one that will address point of care testing, one that will address hematology, and one that will address molecular diagnostics, so there’s multiple dimensions to this",neg,train
"The menu expansions in our development have gone extremely well in the last, say, 10 to 12 months, so they’ve got very full menus, and therefore the pace of introduction can go much faster because accounts don’t really want to address change until they’ve got full menus, or close to it, so that momentum picks up",neg,train
"As far as capital allocation, Brian mentioned in his remarks we were up to a gross $28 billion of debt because of our acquisitions of St",neg,train
"Jude and Alere, and a little bit of lingering debt we had just over time, and we just paid off $4 billion of that so we’re down to $24 billion",neg,train
"Over the next six months, we’ll pay off probably $3",neg,train
"5 billion to $4 billion more, and we’ll be down to $20 billion by the end of ’18",neg,train
"Brian’s run a program with our EVPs to be very conscious of cash generation, and that’s been extremely successful, and our cash flows and profits and so forth right now are as strong as they’ve ever been",neg,train
"We will--we’ve already exceeded the targets that the rating agencies had for us, and we’ll be below--on debt to EBITDA, we’ll be below 3 at year-end, and on a net debt basis we’ll be below 2",neg,train
"So we’ll be in a very strong metrics position at year-end, and that puts us in, let’s say, a position to be at a more normal capital allocation viewpoint at that point",neg,train
"That said, the last couple quarters had some anomalies that bumped these numbers up and down",neg,train
"We went through a couple of disruptions in India, for example, which is a big part of our business, where we went through the demonetization issue and then the GST tax thing",neg,test
"We actually managed that really well, I think, but that affected inventory management by wholesalers and distributors, which are a big part of our business system here",neg,train
The first question I wanted to ask was specifically on diagnostics,neg,train
"I guess I was just a little intrigued by the fact that the guidance you gave for the year implies some improvement, and you also talked about that in your comments",neg,train
"One is can you talk about how the Alinity roll-out could cadence through the year, and then secondly, now that you have had Alere or rapid diagnostics under your belt for a little while, can you talk about the state of that asset and how you expect that to grow over the coming years?",neg,train
"First off, congratulations on a very nice close to 2017",neg,train
"I think it’d probably be helpful, because the fourth quarter of ’16 to the fourth quarter ’17 has some moving parts, what do you think the clean organic performance was for 4Q17?",neg,train
"Turning to our results, sales for the fourth quarter increased 7",neg,train
"Exchange had a positive impact of 2% on sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 9",neg,train
"Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58",neg,train
"Overall as we look at 2017, we delivered strong adjusted EPS growth of 13",neg,train
5% and significantly exceeded our cash flow objectives with full-year 2017 operating cash flow in excess of $5 billion and free cash flow in excess of $4 billion,neg,test
Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo,neg,train
"As we enter 2018, we’re more diverse and better balanced than ever before",neg,train
"Great products are coming from our pipeline, which I’ll highlight as I review each of businesses in just a moment",neg,train
All of this translates into our expectations for another year of strong financial performance in 2018,neg,train
"As we announced this morning, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2",neg,train
I think Alere will be a little slower emergence than St,neg,train
"Jude sort of exploded on the scene here over one year, and I don’t think Alere will explode on the scene but I don’t think Alere is going to be flat either",neg,train
I think we believe there’s a lot of growth here in this entire rapid diagnostic and point of care space,neg,train
"I think there’s a lot of growth, and I think that growth is sustainable over many years, but I don’t think it’s going to be--I’m not going to be telling you the same story about Alere at the end of the year",neg,train
"At the end of ’18, I’m going to tell you we had a good year, it tracked better than we thought, it’s showing growth",neg,train
"As you can see, the combination of Abbott and St",neg,train
"Jude created a best-in-class cardiovascular device portfolio with depth, breadth, and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to customers and payors",neg,train
We had a long-term strategy to become a leader in cardiovascular care,neg,train
We laid the foundation over a number of years and the combination of Abbott and St,neg,train
Jude also brought us into neuromodulation where several recently launched products led to 30% growth in the fourth quarter through both share capture and market expansion,neg,train
This leading portfolio of products offers (indiscernible) relief for patients living with chronic pain and helps those suffering from movement disorders,neg,train
The positive effects of these products are nothing short of amazing,neg,test
"We’ve been careful to monitor our inventories of previous product versus new product, etc",neg,train
", so to the extent that we can have visibility to that, I think we’re comfortable with how that transition has gone",neg,train
"I think we’re not seeing the kind of disruption that we might have or that we’ve seen in the last couple years, so thus far I’m glad we don’t see unpredicted disruption, so hopefully we can now stabilize back into a more normal, call it competition in the market",neg,test
"It’s a very, very dynamic market anyway in terms of channels and numbers of competitors and the intensity of competition and so forth",neg,train
"We didn’t need the disruption of the food safety law, but I think that’s stable and kind of behind us at this point",neg,train
Jude has gotten a lot of attention on the call but Alere less so,neg,train
"What’s your focus for 2018 for Alere? Can this asset definitively get back to underlying growth in ’18, and how quickly can Alere get back to what you would think is market growth for point of care? Thanks",neg,train
Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"Yes, I think on CRM, you’re about right - we would expect something in the low single digits on that front",neg,train
"Obviously we’re still early in the launch of that, first quarter",neg,train
"The feedback, though, we’re getting from physicians on that one is very positive",neg,train
"This is the only device out there that’s smartphone compatible, so there’s a big benefit on the patient side of it as well",neg,train
"Your forecast on that one, I think seems reasonable as well",neg,train
"Before we open the call for questions, I’ll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business",neg,train
"For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year",neg,train
"In nutrition, we forecast low single digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year",neg,train
"In diagnostics, we forecast organic sales growth of mid-single digits in the first quarter and mid to high single digits for the full year; and in medical devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits for both the first quarter and for the full year",neg,train
"In rhythm management, we closed the MRI safe product gap across our portfolio in the U",neg,train
"including FDA approvals of our pacemaker, ICD, and CRTD devices",neg,train
"In electrophysiology, we launched EnSite Precision, our best-in-class cardiac mapping system",neg,train
We also launched our next generation Confirm insertable cardiac heart monitor in Europe and the U,neg,train
"With its slimmer product profile, easy insertion procedure, and smartphone connectivity, initial customer feedback on Confirm has been very positive",neg,test
"In heart failure, we launched HeartMate 3 in the U",neg,train
"This lifesaving system helps pump blood through the body for advanced heart failure patients as they await further treatment, including heart transplant",neg,train
We also have an ongoing development program to expand our indications here to include destination therapy for patients where transplant isn’t an option,neg,train
"In vascular, we launched Xience Sierra, the newest generation of our leading Xience stent system in Europe",neg,train
Initial market feedback has been positive and we anticipate bringing Sierra to the U,neg,train
"I did direct a significant amount of the benefit from tax into R&D and SG&A, and I think that’s warranted given not only the new product launches and how fast we want to run with some of these, but--so I’ve directed some of the benefit to increased R&D investment, and you can imagine--I mean, I’ve directed some of that at diabetes care and Libre, I’ve directed some of that at neuromodulation and other cardiovascular products, I’ve directed a fair bit of it at SG&A expansion and so forth",neg,test

Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements,neg,train
"Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law",neg,train
"Okay, that makes more sense, but still a big number",neg,train
I assume right now the majority of that obviously is outside the United States,neg,train
Can you give us a sense as to the pace of your sign-ups in the U,neg,test
and what you think for 2018 from a patient perspective for Libre in the U,neg,test
"Also just on the margin contribution, with the rebound in top line growth for the St",neg,train
"Jude franchise, is it safe to assume that the margin contribution outlook for that unit in 2018 is going to step up nicely?",neg,test
I’ll answer part of that and then I’ll phone a friend here at the table,neg,test
"I’d say first of all, I personally was concerned that this switchover in the food safety law, what we had to all do to comply with product labeling in a number of products and so forth, I was afraid it was going to be terribly disruptive, and it turns out we’ve already experienced the disruption in the past two years as the market was flooded with many products and a lot of volume and a lot of channels and so forth",neg,train
"The single biggest issue we all had to deal with was reregister products and comply with the elements of the law, and all of our concerns were would we get our products through the regulatory bodies in China and be ready for that transition, and the answer is we made it",neg,train
"Beyond that, I don’t have a lot more detail to give you, other than so far, so good, and I think our transition management has been excellent",neg,test
We went through sort of the same things with St,neg,train
"Jude - we reorganized a lot of businesses there into fully integrated business units, we did it in the first six months",neg,train
"That’s usually very disruptive, but we managed to do it without disruption, and we did it with Alere in a matter of weeks, so I’d say we’re in a strong position",neg,train
I’m very pleased with the management team and how rapidly it’s up to speed,neg,train
"We’ve got a couple of new hires on some of the business, but I’d say this team has gotten up to speed quick",neg,test
This past year was a very good and important one for our company,neg,train
"We performed well and our new product pipeline was highly productive, and we took some very important strategic steps forward, as you know",neg,train
Jude in January followed by the sale of our medical optics business and in the fall our acquisition of Alere,neg,train
"Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the strong finish to 2017",neg,train
You guys laid out some synergy targets around the acquisition,neg,train
"I just wanted to get an update on whether or not you think that there is upside to those historic targets, particularly on the revenue synergy side",neg,train
"We’ve been assuming revenue synergies hitting in year two, but are you already seeing revenue synergies come?",neg,train
"With that, we will now open the call for questions",neg,train
"Jude and Alere will enhance our leadership, scale and presence in attractive areas of healthcare",neg,train
"We’ve long been a major global player in diagnostics, and Alere adds rapid diagnostics to our existing leadership position in the $50 billion global diagnostics market",neg,test
"Jude, on the other hand, made us a leading player in medical devices, particularly in the very important cardiovascular area, where were previously had leadership in only certain focused areas",neg,train
Jude made us a major player in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market,neg,train
"Jude also brought us into a promising new area, neuromodulation to treat chronic pain and movement disorders",neg,train
"So I’d say, first of all, the underlying dynamics are strong",neg,train
We’ve put a fair amount of emphasis in renewing and broadening our products,neg,train
"We’ve put a lot of attention into our own, let’s call it development productivity, registration productivity, etc",neg,train
"We’re putting more and more investment into India and our distributor organizations to do just that, because we believe we can and should",neg,train
"We’re putting a lot of attention on gross margin management to improve our gross margins, whether in procurement or things that we source from third parties that we should do ourselves, and so forth",neg,train
"So there’s a lot of emphasis on margin improvement, and frankly the margin is already good, better than good, but we know that there’s opportunity to improve it still further",neg,train
"A lot of people think of generics as commodity, generics that don’t make much money",neg,test
"It’s sort of an OTX type thing in a lot of these markets, and we make pretty good profits here, so the characteristics of these markets have been that",neg,train
"Generally when it’s quiet, things are going good in emerging markets, and it’s been fairly quiet",neg,train
We did deliver double digit growth in emerging markets this quarter,neg,train
"As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to 2017 sales growth, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable basis and do not include results from our earlier acquisitions, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we utilized all of last year",neg,train
"CRM, I think you grew about 2% in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"Is that how we should think about 2018, or do you think that could better? Then there was a question asked earlier on Confirm Rx, maybe just setting expectations, could you do, say, $50 million in 2018 on that product? Is that realistic? Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter",neg,train
Then you’ve got to deal with the life cycle of contracts that are out there in the world,neg,train
"It’s a significant scale, and our attention now is all about scale-up and all about pace and magnitude",neg,train
"This is not going to be some incremental, slow-rolling thing",neg,train
So I think we’re in a really great position with Alinity,neg,train
Our challenge now is just mass scaling as we attack that market,neg,train
"Turning to established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where we achieved another quarter of double digit sales growth led by broad-based performance across several countries, including India, China, and Latin America",neg,test
"As you know, over the past several years we’ve shaped this business through a series of strategic moves",neg,train
"These actions not only shaped how we participate by adding scale and strengthening our product portfolios, but also fundamentally enhanced where we participate",neg,test
There is no other business like it in the world,neg,train
"Emerging markets are growing rapidly, their populations are aging, their middle classes are expanding, and their healthcare systems are developing",neg,train
Our strategy to build significant presence and scale in these fast-growing markets is unique and has been highly successful,neg,train
"Just wanted to see what emerging market growth was in the quarter and if that accelerated in fourth quarter versus earlier in the year, and then what your outlook is for 2018 from an emerging market perspective, because it seems like things have been really going well in emerging markets generally",neg,train
"So, there is a domain expertise factor here that we’re believing and hoping that there’s going to be a kind of a shortening of the traditional ramp that would be normally be associated with new people",neg,train
"And so, while we do have I would say a healthy percentage of people on board now that are relatively new to Accuray over the last 90 or 120 days, they are not new to the space",neg,train
They are people that are proven performers in our domain over earlier years and many years,neg,train
"Number two, the strategic importance of radiation equipment for particularly the state-of-the-art equipment for these potential customers",neg,train
"I have talked in my prepared remarks that we currently already defer training revenue in our current financial statements and only recognize that when it’s delivered, which I know some of the competitive comments have said they are changing how they account for that",neg,train
So that won’t be a change in timing for us,neg,train
"2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year at the sequential increase of $1",neg,train
1 million due to increased upgrade purchase on service contract,neg,test
Over 90% of our customers purchase service contracts providing a predictable revenue stream,neg,train
And you talked historically that a search for a domestic JV partner in China,neg,train
Any update on progress there and can you help us understand how big a deal there could be in terms of unlocking access to the China radiation oncology market opportunity?,neg,train
"Further as discussed during our last call in October, prior financial periods included a quarterly $2 million intangible amortization charge from the TomoTherapy acquisition",neg,train
This amortization charge was fully amortized in Q4 over the prior year and will not reoccur in fiscal 2018,neg,train
"Within this Treatment Planning System is a module known as PRECISEART which captures and identifies anatomical changes that have occurred internally within the patient during the course of treatment due to weight loss, inflammation and tumor shrinkage",neg,train
"Again, we are encouraged and pleased with what we’ve seen, its tangible impact obviously in the last two quarters -- this last quarter Q2 specifically in obviously very visible way",neg,train
"I think that there’s more work to do here but the work that we’re doing, the resources and what they’re focused on are definitely having an impact",neg,train
All of this translates ultimately into a more predictable revenue forecast accuracy as we go forward,neg,train
The -- just comparatively if you think historically we have been underpowered from just about any metric you would use in terms of feet on the street comparatively from a commercial infrastructure standpoint with competitors,neg,train
"It was the catalyst quite frankly that really kind of drove us to taking a hard look at the market opportunity, the consultant project that we talked about commissioning at the end of last year and really focusing the energies of that work in several areas",neg,train
The primary drivers of our product revenue growth has been twofold,neg,train
"First, we are converting the initial orders of Radixact to revenue",neg,train
We have recognized more than 25 Radixact units since product launch,neg,train
"Second, we increased distributor revenues due to year-over-year improvements in distributor order to revenue conversion",neg,train
"So, our install base now is North of 800, probably more than 850 range and 800 to 900 install EBITDA range",neg,train
"And those units roughly one-third of those Anthony are older than 8 years, so it would be ripe for replacement",neg,train
"Can you remind us, I think it was this time last year may have been in fiscal 1Q of '17 where their measures were put in place? But importantly I think from a comp standpoint, what percentage of the U",neg,train
"distributor orders were sort of stuck and are now sort of in a position where they can float a revenue, thanks again",neg,train
And then I guess thinking I had a little bit on pipeline here you talk about enabling motion management on Radixact and then improved imaging on both CyberKnife and Radixact,neg,train
Can you maybe just talk on timeline and precession to rollout? I know that’s in development to when you think you roll that out?,neg,train
We believe retiring the principal in cash and avoiding a significant amount of dilution is another positive step in our capital structure transformation,neg,train
The remaining $13 million of convertible notes due in February are convertible into approximately 2,neg,train
5 million shares of common stock should the notes mature above the conversion price of $5,neg,train
"After retirement of the February 2018 notes, all debts will have maturities that is 4 plus years from now",neg,train
This will consist of the term loan and the asset back revolver of up to $72 million and the 2022 convertible notes of $85 million,neg,train
"The second momentum driver is the recent launch of our suite of software upgrades that significantly improve our treatment planning capabilities, oncology department workflow and connectivity of our systems",neg,train
These upgrades include both our integrated data management system IDMS and our Accuray Precision Treatment Planning Software,neg,train
Our current commercial momentum is being driven by several factors,neg,train
"First, our Radixact system is being accepted in the market as a true workhorse product as a result of significantly improved product performance, functional capabilities, and broad case mix versatility",neg,train
"Improvements in treatment speed, overall throughput and efficiency of workflow are changing our strategic product positioning and overall market opportunity",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Brooks O'Neil from Lake Street Capital,neg,train
"Welcome to Accuray’s conference call to review financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended on December 31, 2017",neg,train
"Joining us today are Josh Levine, Accuray’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Waters, Accuray’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
These and other risks are more fully described in the press release we issued after the market closed this afternoon as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Additionally, our future systems and software roadmap that we’ve been sharing with customers which includes enabling motion management capability for the Radixact System and improved imaging for both the CyberKnife and Radixact systems, is contributing to our overall commercial momentum",neg,train
"Second quarter operating loss was $1 million, compared to a loss of $4",neg,train
8 million in the second quarter of prior year and adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal second quarter was $4,neg,train
"To give you a better sense about the market response to our Radixact system, over the past 12 months, we have taken more than 50 orders to backlog with a majority of those in the previous two quarters",neg,train
"In every region where Radixact product registration is complete, which currently represents US, Europe and Japan, we have a growing sales funnel of opportunities",neg,train
The majority of the sales contribution in the first half of fiscal 2018 has primarily been in Western Europe and Japan,neg,train
"I don't know that I can, we have a percentage of orders that were let's say bought down",neg,train
"Just to be clear we put this added emphasis the addition positions I talked about adding before Anthony, we added those in literally in the first fiscal quarter of 2018",neg,train
"We're talking about the VP revenue management position in Q4 of last year, but the additional project management resources in the region working with the distributors, those were all headcount adds in coming into this fiscal cycle in Q1",neg,train
"If you think about just order of magnitude about how the order backlog has shifted overtime, I think we've been public with metrics that say that in the past three years, better than 15% of the distributor generated orders, basically we've had 15% growth in the last three years in distributor generated orders",neg,train
"So, channel mix is having an impact on again the length of time that these orders are sitting in the backlog",neg,train
"We've talked about the range of activities and the processes that when you introduce a distributor organization into site planning, permitting, construction oversight with an end user institution",neg,train
We don't have direct line of sight anymore in those situations,neg,train
"So, these were the kind of catalyst for us moving in the direction we did with regards to streamlining those processes, putting more direct line of sight from an oversight and reporting structure and accountability perspective in place in order to help move these things along",neg,train
And I think that we're pretty pleased with what we're seeing to date in that related activity,neg,train
"Before we open up the call for your questions, I'd like to thank the entire Accuray team for their increased focus, commitment and improving execution supporting our important work that's make me difference in patient's lives",neg,train
The other really important element that was added to that was a sales resource deployment analysis which essentially was a territory level market coverage model from a territory standpoint,neg,test
"Those places quite frankly where we based on our latest generation of products, our physician in the market where we’ve been strong historically, basically defining a competitive targeting analysis that was kind of where do we have our best right to win",neg,train
The opportunity here really has been focused on the portion or the segment of the market that’s going to fall outside of Class A radiotherapy,neg,train
"This is by absolute opportunity, the biggest segment of product opportunity in the market",neg,train
"If you go back to Class A in our earlier estimates, we estimate that even at its peak the Class A radiotherapy segment which is the premium and highest-level specification products and price point products, probably only represented about 15% of the market opportunity in China",neg,train
"I mean our activity for Radixact, Tycho, really kind of stands the gamut, that covers the waterfront if you will of opportunities",neg,train
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today’s conference",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan,neg,train
"2%, 340 basis point expansion compared with the prior year period gross margin of 35",neg,train
"Product gross margins increased 43% in the quarter, compared to 35",neg,train
Product gross margins were favorably impacted by a larger percentage of our overall revenue attributable to CyberKnife Systems and increased Radixact Systems as compared to prior year,neg,train
Our go-to-market strategy for the Radixact Systems is generating favorable pricing and margins as compared to our order generation TomoTherapy Systems,neg,test
"I was curious when I talk with investors, one of the big sort of macro pushbacks I get is people feeling like the hospital environment both here and in other parts of the world is not sufficiently strong to allow you to see an acceleration in your revenue and order growth",neg,test
"And I was hoping you might just give us some sense of sort of what you see as the overall environment out there, number one",neg,train
CyberKnife system orders in the second quarter were in line with our expectations but were a bit behind the prior year due to a very strong CyberKnife system order mix in the second quarter of fiscal 2017,neg,train
Orders from replacement sales to our existing customers during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were in line with our recent historical order contribution percentage of 15% to 20% of total global order mix,neg,train
"I don’t know, if we have, I don’t have the upgraded to M6 data in front of me",neg,train
"But the reality is there are still, a reasonable degree of devices out there without an MLC, the Multileaf Collimator",neg,train
And so that really is where the opportunity is for us,neg,train
"That probably represents -- I’m going to guess it probably represents at least 60% plus, 65% plus of the install based that still is not operating with the M6 platform",neg,train
"So, our level of penetration with MLC on M6 has probably been 30%, 35%, which leaves obviously a lot of runway for us",neg,train
"And then last one, you talked about current order and backlog recognition being conservative",neg,train
In light of ASC 606 and what your competitor had to go through,neg,train
"Are you expecting any impact on order of revenue, volatility and visibility?",neg,train
Maybe just a few housekeeping that’s starting and revisiting on distributor orders,neg,train
So maybe just an update on the total install base and specifically the Tomo install base and what percentage of those really are up for renewal and would you view that segment really as sort of low hanging fruit improve for Radixact? And then I have a follow-up,neg,train
We look forward speaking with your and we’ll report our Q3 results at the end of April,neg,train
I’d now like to introduce your host for today’s program Doug Sherk,neg,train
"The last part of your question, I think for us is really about our products and our competitive positioning was what you’re focused on, the answer is this company has the best products, the best performing products both functionally, capability wise, clinical impact wise and workflow efficiency wise that either platform has quite frankly seen in the company’s history",neg,train
"Really, really significant change in capability, case mix versatility, we reached really workforce status when you start talking about the Tomo side and Radixact specifically",neg,test
"And so, I like where we are in terms of our portfolio positioning",neg,train
"For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect operating expense increases of approximately 3% to 5%, which is a run rate of approximately $40 million per quarter",neg,train
"Although at this point, we expect the trend towards the higher end of this range",neg,train
"And with that, I would now like to hand the call back to Josh",neg,train
On the CyberKnife we’ve got more clinical data than any -- more device-specific clinical data than any of the product in the space,neg,train
"We are really a terrific solution now with that product in its most current form for a wide range of treatment types beyond just the intracranial area which is still about 50% of the case mix but lung, liver and prostate are the other 50% of the CyberKnife installed base case mix treatment today, and prostates specifically on an absolute procedure volume basis the fastest growing",neg,train
And that has a lot to do with the product and how it’s performing and the improvements that we’ve made in it,neg,train
"So, I think we’re more strongly positioned as a company today and over the next several years than we’ve been ever",neg,train
The last driver is the impact we are beginning to see from our revenue management and revenue conversion initiatives focused on our international distributor orders that we launched coming into fiscal 2018,neg,train
"We had approximately $106 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and investments at December 31st",neg,test
We plan this part of our cash to retire the $40 million of convertible notes that are due in February 2018 by executing the strategy that minimize the shareholder dilution,neg,train
"For approximately $27 million of the convertible notes do, we have elected the net share settlement method, which need the company will paid a principal amount of these notes in cash in any access of the convergent value will be delivered at shares",neg,test
"Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that our call today includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our future business plans and strategies",neg,train
"There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the adoption of the CyberKnife, TomoTherapy and Radixact Systems' commercial execution; future order growth; future revenue growth; and macro economic factors outside of the company’s control",neg,train
"While it’s too early to declare victory on this point, we are pleased with the visual traction we are seeing and the early indications of improved timing related to revenue recognition",neg,train
"I mean, we are really, really focused on the replacement opportunity",neg,train
It’s a key initiative and key deliverable for our commercial teams in both the U,neg,train
"And if you think about just over the course for the last two fiscal cycles, two years",neg,train
We finished fiscal 2016 roughly in the 15% of total order mix ratio in terms of those replacement sales contributions,neg,train
Our first question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen,neg,train
We've reaffirmed our guidance earlier this month and do so again today,neg,train
This represents year-over-year growth of approximately 5% for gross orders,neg,test
We expect the third quarter of 2018 to be in the low $80 million range,neg,train
This continues our sequential growth quarter-over-quarter for fiscal 2018 and is in line with our operating plan,neg,train
"When you start talking about more treatment volume around stereotactic body radiotherapy and image guided IMRT, our portfolio lines up well with those directional reimbursement trends and kind of strategic trends",neg,test
"So, I think that part of this is again, we're well aligned from a portfolio and clinical capability standpoint with where reimbursement is heading longer term",neg,train
Our financial performance during the quarter was highlighted by total revenue of $100,neg,train
Product revenue increased 33% year-over-year suggesting that we are seeing the early effects of a heightened focus on improving the revenue conversion process related to international distributor orders,neg,train
Gross order performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $77,neg,train
Order growth was primarily driven by our TomoTherapy family of products which represented 80% of the unit volume during the quarter,neg,train
More specifically Radixact system orders represented 70% of all TomoTherapy orders,neg,train
"And then as I had also noted that while ASC 606 doesn’t directly address backlog, we also have never included any type of service offering or un-built service contracts in our backlog",neg,train
"I also want to be clear that under current Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Accuray already allocates revenue across all discrete performance obligations including service type obligations and training and therefore those revenues are not recognized until they are delivered in our currently reported financial results and will not represent deferrals of future periods under ASC 606",neg,train
"With that out of the way, I turn the call over to Accruray's President and Chief Executive Officer, Josh Levine",neg,test
"Kevin, you reaffirmed guidance including an order growth of 5%, fiscal third quarter has been seasonally weak quarter-to-quarter for a rate [ph] until last year",neg,train
"Can you just remind us what drove these toward seasonality? And then the setup here is for back half, second half weighted order performance",neg,train
"And can you just talk about your confidence there in terms of, I think you said low 80 million for fiscal 3Q and then I would suggest a 100 plus in Q4? But just a guidance on your confidence level",neg,train
Can you give us a sense of what percentage of the install basis is at this point upgraded to M6 and I guess is there additional room here for further upgrades?,neg,train
And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today’s program,neg,train
I would like to hand the program back to Josh Levine President and CEO for any further remarks,neg,train
"Accuray Incorporated (NASDAQ:ARAY) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2018  4:30 PM ET",neg,train
A couple of weeks ago I wouldn’t have asked this question because the stock was quite a bit lower than it is right now,neg,train
"But right now, I would think you might actually be in the range of the convert, and as Kevin mentioned just the 13 million that might be susceptible to that",neg,train
But would you be willing to just say what you think some of the more palatable actions might be for addressing that Kevin?,neg,train
First half of fiscal 2018 service gross margins was 38,neg,train
"4%, which represent 140 basis point improvement over prior year",neg,train
"As noted previously, quarterly service margins can fluctuate and therefore, we look at our first half margin results as our best indicator of the progress of our service business and we are in plan for this operating metrics for the fiscal year-to-date",neg,train
"So, the discussions and the dialogue from a JV standpoint are still active",neg,test
"It’s Joshua, I’d say of that third of the units that Kevin just talked about probably a 60-40, 60% Tomo family related, 40% CyberKnife mix",neg,train
"And that’s really from a geographic concentration standpoint, primarily in the U",neg,train
"And then one question on the Americas region, that’s a region that’s obviously underperformed in past quarters",neg,train
Can you discuss what is giving you confidence in a fiscal second half improvement in the Americas region? Is there something you are seeing in terms of the sales funnel post the recent hires?,neg,train
Those conversations from where I sit right now and from what we've seen are really behind us,neg,train
The reality is that radiotherapy when it's done right is an absolute profit center for most hospitals,neg,train
And comparatively an important part of their clinical strategic positioning discussion as it relates to multidisciplinary cancer care model,neg,train
"So, let me start with the first part of the question, which was kind of the macro CapEx environment",neg,train
I think we're in a more stable place today than we've been in quite some time,neg,train
"I mean if you go back over the course of the last several years, we've been in the affordable care act of Obamacare, we've been out of the affordable care act of Obamacare",neg,train
"I would say certainly probably more people hospital sea level capital commitment standpoint, several years ago looking more cautiously perhaps about the CapEx environment",neg,train
Growth in the second quarter was primarily due to our European and APAC regions,neg,train
In APAC we generated these increased revenues primarily from sales outside of China,neg,train
"So again, I think we're in a relatively good place again compared to the last several years in terms of where we're at now",neg,train
"I would say generally, we are seeing a much more stable recently stable reimbursement environment",neg,train
"Last July, CMS announced kind of where we'll be in radiation reimbursement, and again the net effect for us and the space overall, I believe has been relatively neutral to slightly positive",neg,train
"I think longer term, on the reimbursement front, there is no question that just directionally people are moving and I think the system is moving too more of an episodic payment type of model",neg,train
"But we think as we've talked about in the past, we're well positioned to deal with that",neg,test
"First, during the question-and-answer-session we request the questioners to limit themselves to two questions and then requeue with any follow ups",neg,test
"Second, all references we make to a specific quarter in the prepared remarks are to our fiscal year quarters",neg,train
"For example, statement regarding our second quarter referred our fiscal second quarter which ended December 31, 2017",neg,train
"I mean, I think the early stage is a visibility for some of those projects",neg,train
"1 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year period",neg,train
Product revenue was fairly evenly mixed between our CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems with a very meaningful contribution from Radixact,neg,train
"And operator with that, we're now ready to open the line for questions",neg,train
"Right now, we’re currently marketing to our own internal operating plan in the first two quarters and again in Q3 with the low $80 million number I gave",neg,train
Josh had walk through a lot of the initiatives that we commence at the beginning of this year,neg,train
And we’re really starting to see some attraction in the U,neg,train
", I expect a lot of those initial opportunities to come to revenue in our fiscal third and fourth quarter",neg,train
"driven in the back half tempered by a very moderate, conservative view around China and Class A license issuances",neg,train
"And in terms of real tangible dollars and how that translates, if you look at our European region in total, in the first half of 2018 Anthony, Europe represents 35% of our total revenues",neg,train
And that's compared to only 25% of total revenues in the first half of fiscal '17,neg,train
"And the primary driver of that are the increased activities, Josh just described around distributor conversion",neg,test
Operating expenses for the quarter were on expectations at $40,neg,train
The majority of the operating expense growth coming from the R&D line as we increased our progress spending on both our Radixact and CyberKnife system,neg,train
G&A also increased year-over-year due to higher business development and incentive compensation expenses,neg,train
Josh on Radixact you talked about kind of the replacement cycle and the opportunity there,neg,train
"Just curious on greenfield opportunity and competitive, what the funnel looks like there?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Henry from RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
Now I would like to turn the call over to Kevin for a deeper look at our financial performance,neg,train
"For the first half of fiscal 2018, revenue grew 10% compared to the prior year",neg,test
"Our CyberKnife system was a major contributor to this growth, which in turn translate into higher product gross margins, which I will discuss later",neg,train
And then what also is the mix of Tomo within there as well?,neg,train
"We have added additional project management support in the regions to help assist with streamlining processes, assisting distributors with the range of activities that ultimately results in installation and revenue recognition",neg,train
I think a higher level of accountability quite frankly has started to become visible across all of those activities as a result of some of the resources we’ve added,neg,train
"In our Americas region, with specific reference to our U",neg,train
"commercial organization, I can report that we are making progress in the build out and restructuring of the U",neg,train
commercial team that we embarked on as we started fiscal 2018,neg,train
"A way of background, you'll remember that the third-party U",neg,test
market opportunity analysis that we commissioned was focused on restructuring our U,neg,train
We'd now completed all incremental filing and restructuring related to the U,neg,train

We are reiterating our revenue range of $390 million to $400 million,neg,train
We have exceeded expectations on revenue in the first half of the year and therefore feel very confident about this guidance metric at this time,neg,train
"For EBITDA we are reiterating a range of $25 million to $30 million, which would result in year-over-year growth between 23% and 47%",neg,train
We anticipate a Q3 net age-outs to be at a comparable level to our recently completed second quarter,neg,train
"On a full year basis, we expect to see a year-over-year improvement in net age-outs as a percentage of average backlog",neg,train
"Additionally, although separate from the move to 606, Accuray's current backlog only includes product gross orders and we do not include any billed or unbilled service contracts in our current backlog",neg,train

"At the end of fiscal ’17, we were about 20% of total order mix",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies,neg,train
Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call,neg,test
Accuray's fiscal second quarter performance continued to positive momentum which seen over the last several quarters,neg,train
Contributing to these results were the continuing impact of our latest generation of devices across both our Radixact and CyberKnife product platforms as well as our most recent software upgrades,neg,train
"Finally, I want to provide a brief update on our assessment of the new accounting standard, 606",neg,train
Accuray will be adopting this standard at the beginning of our fiscal year 2019,neg,train
Currently we do not believe the adoption of 606 materially changes the timing of our revenue recognition although we are still evaluating the full impact,neg,train
I wanted to ask first about the initiatives you put in place to rectify the revenue conversion delays you're experienced in the EMEA and APAC regions,neg,test
And Josh what do you have experienced to generate a base line level of confidence in the sustainability of the new revenue conversion dynamic,neg,test
By my math it looks like revenue guidance implies kind of fiscal second half '18 revenue growth that is flat to down versus fiscal second half '17,neg,train
"That compares to kind of first half of this year, where you guys grew 10% on the revenue side",neg,train
"So, is this being conservative, or is there something that you need to think about in terms of fiscal second half '18 versus fiscal first half '18 revenue guidance?",neg,train
I think the things we’ve got in the pipeline from a roadmap perspective will only add fuel and provide some tailwind over the next several years in terms of that product’s positioning capability,neg,train
"So, Brandon our back half of the year still does on a year-over-year basis, for second half to first half cause a lot of foreign increase over the first half of the year",neg,train
"And therefore, even though we are trending ahead of kind of where we wanted to be at this time of the year, we feel it’s appropriate to stay focused kind of on our range",neg,train
We are seeing good progress as Josh mentioned around distributor revenue conversion activities,neg,train
"But right now, we are focused on achieving our guidance and the calendarization is planning out as we expected",neg,train
"I mean again, if you go back to some of the remarks or metrics, we shared in the prepared remarks",neg,train
50 systems over the course of the last year with almost half of those going to revenue in the last two quarters or three quarters is we think a pretty strong indicator of market adoption and market uptake for this device,neg,train
"And again, would you view -- are those discussions sort of on those particular units moving in such a way where you do see that is low-hanging fruit for Radixact?",neg,train
These key areas I just highlighted are the difference makers supporting our improved commercial momentum,neg,test
These are the primary factors allowing us to reiterate our full year fiscal 2018 financial guidance,neg,train
We’ve had some install based obviously replacement sale opportunities that have been more in our traditional academic medical center situations,neg,train
"But in all of the markets, where we’ve got Radixact approved, which is basically now U",neg,train
", Japan and Europe, we’re leading with that product as opposed to the Tomo H series",neg,train
"And right now, we’re seeing a growing sales funnel in terms of a healthy mix of replacement opportunities, new bunkers, competitive target opportunities",neg,train
And we feel good about the market uptake for that product and where the funnel is right now,neg,train
"Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Accuray Incorporated Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
At this time all participants are in a listen only-mode,neg,train
Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time,neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today’s program is being recorded",neg,train
"And then three, just a quick overview of how you assess your competitive posture today, that'd be very helpful",neg,train
"So, the big opportunity is still out there waiting to be captured from a value segment and a core segment perspective",neg,train
And we would hope at this point to have no later than the end of the calendar 2018 year something to announce,neg,train
But quite frankly I think we are probably on a track to have something to talk about may be by the end of our fiscal cycle at the end of June,neg,train
"Our net orders for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, were $52",neg,train
6 million resulting primarily from net age out of $21 million and cancellations of $3,neg,train
Net age outs were within our previously provided guidance range of $18 million to $24 million,neg,train
5 million and is our best indicator for future product revenue growth,neg,train
"On a regional basis, our EMEA and Japan regions continue to perform well and were strong contributors to our order performance",neg,train
"While our APAC region performed to expectations, China remains a headwind due to uncertain timing related to the Class A radiotherapy license announcement",neg,train
"And then just wanted to go back to talking about the moratorium and mortgages obviously we may have to wait until April to really get a clear view on how delinquencies trend particularly in the mortgage book but I’m curious to hear additional color if you can give any around the statement about delinquencies and the consumer book being better or similar to prior performance so far post the moratorium, what - is that because people have already cash or what trends do you think of led to that?",neg,test
"To be clear, those loans get pulled back to make sure everything on the same page, under the GNMA program, the loans are 90 days or more delinquent even though they have a moratorium, the seller issuer has the right to repurchase them, the right but not the obligations that we bring him back to accounting purposes",neg,train
Insurance companies have begun to make advances to our clients but the pace has been slowed due to the massive volume of clients,neg,train
"4 billion have been awarded in emergency, relief assistance to individuals, public corporations and municipalities",neg,train
Congress approved a relief package that includes up to $4,neg,train
However these sponsors been delayed pending more clarity on the government’s cash balances,neg,train
Total non-performing including covered loans of $743 million were down from $774 million at year end 2016,neg,train
Our capital levels remained strong with year Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios at 16,neg,train
"The reasons behind it is quite frankly but the data we’ve shown is that looking at the delinquency and comparing today’s amount compared to the same page prior to hurricane and prior to beginning of last year, we seen improvements in or similar results in most of our consumer portfolio",neg,test
Obviously the moratorium had an impact in terms of providing the consumer additional relief for the last quarter of the year and that could potential impact the level of delinquency that we see in the first month,neg,test
"Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $276 million, down from the prior year’s $258 mostly due to both the impact of the hurricanes and $64 million in provision expense related to our U",neg,train
"Yeah, I think - I’ll let Lidio go into more detail, but we’re watching the consumer behavior very carefully",neg,train
We are looking at general macroeconomic indicators for the economy such as employment spending in terms of debit and credit card and how that impacts everyone and we are looking at payments,neg,train
"Obviously, you know we are not going to get real definitive data after the first quarter, so that’s when we be able dig in more",neg,test
I don’t believe if you want to add anything on that,neg,test
"We have not been swamped by people asking to change their billing address to Florida or something like that, so that has not occurred",neg,train
", we recorded a provision for loan losses of $10 million and chart-off $32 million related to our taxi medallion portfolio, impacting the U",neg,train
"Excluding the taxi medallion portfolio, which we acquired in the Doral transaction, impacting the U",neg,train
"Excluding the taxi medallion portfolio, which we acquired in the Doral transaction, asset quality in the U",neg,train
"Yeah, the most important effect on our margin and one of the main reason it dropped is asset mix",neg,train
"The investment portfolio continues to have same characteristics it has historically with us, is very high quality stuff and most of the securities we added were U",neg,train
"We do not extend our investment portfolio significantly, the average duration our investment portfolio is about three and a half years, so we gravitate around that",neg,train
"Some of the stuff we added this quarter may have been a bit slower, shorter because we all look into the rate, so",neg,train
"Given the expiration of the moratorium on December, the early weeks of the first quarter of 2018 have given us a first look into eventual credit trends post hurricane",neg,train
Slide 4 presents our financial results for the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Additional information is provided on Slide 5, 6 and the appendix",neg,train
"Today’s earnings press release detailed variances from the third quarter driven by higher net interest income and a lower loan loss provision, offset by other captures effected by the hurricane including lower in non-interest income and higher operating expenses",neg,test
"At this point, it’s not clear how of those have left the Island will eventually return at the power and economic situation continue to stabilize",neg,train
"Since the storm, we have had approximately 80 popular employees leave the Island or about 1% of our local workforce",neg,train
"Despite the impact of the hurricanes and the declining population, deposits and customer account were up for the fourth quarter",neg,train
"Early delinquency data for auto, credit card and personal loans for the first few weeks of January was similar or better to that of early 2017, though limited in scope this metrics represent an encouraging trend",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jesus Bueno with Compass Point,neg,train
6% of average loans held in portfolio compared to $53 million or 92 basis points in the third quarter,neg,train
The increase of $41 million in charge-off was primarily driven by higher charge-off in our U,neg,train
"This was coupled with our charge-off in Puerto Rico commercial portfolio related to two large previously reserved relationship of $9 million and higher charge-off in the Puerto Rico mortgage portfolio of $7million, due to lower recoveries after the Hurricanes",neg,train
"For 2018, we anticipate slight growth in overall loan balances with U",neg,train
"Loan balances in Puerto Rico are expected to remain relatively flat, but we are encouraged by the rebound in credit demand that we have seen in November and December",neg,train
"Again migration have accelerated, I just think that the people who are here around some very, very large numbers with very I think a questionable basis for those numbers",neg,train
Almost every credit quality metric for Puerto Rico has been effected by the moratorium granted to consumer and commercial borrowers for Hurricane Maria,neg,test
"Puerto Rico credit metrics reflect lower NPLs, higher inflows to NPL losses and higher charge-offs",neg,train
"For the full year 2017, we reported net income of $108 million, which includes the effect of $168 million expense related to the impact of the U",neg,train
"As we shared in our last call, our focus following the hurricanes were to restore operations as quickly as possible and to address the needs of our employees, customers and communities",neg,train
We identified those employees most affected by the hurricane and provided financial assistance and many other types of support,neg,train
We offered relieve measures for our customers including but not limited to the moratorium and we mobilized to raise funds to assist severely impacted communities mainly through arms race in Puerto Rico initiatives,neg,train
"Could you guys give us an update, I know that the tax lower has passes in the United States, what type of impact on Puerto Rico, I know there were some concern about the taxes on patterns and stuff for companies located in Puerto Rico",neg,test
Do you guys have any feel early on what the impact could be to Puerto Rico?,neg,train
These funds which are estimated to exceed $25 billion are likely to have similar impact on the economy,neg,train
The Island has not yet received the vast majority of expected insurance payments and U,neg,train
"The decrease in NPLs was driven by lower Puerto Rico mortgage NPLs of $31 million, mainly due to lower inflows as a result of the moratorium granted to customers",neg,train
"The initiatives such you have that are going to our results and expenses a little higher from a run rate perspective, I realize some of that’s operational and doesn’t provide revenue but is there any thought that some of this will filter through and aid fee income over the next twelve months as well?",neg,train
"I think when we first got into our portfolio of going through the evaluation exercise, we’ve bought into our books about $0",neg,test
We are touched by the generous contributions of many partners and friends,neg,train
Our foundation was able to deliver immediate relief to the communities most affected by the disaster,neg,train
Our longer term plans includes supporting the work of community based organizations as they implement innovative solutions to our pressing social problems,neg,train
"While the restoration of power generation has been slow, our operations and several measures of economic activity have returned close to pre-storm levels",neg,train
"Regarding Popular’s operations, currently 157 out of a 168 of our Puerto Rico branches are open and 541 out of 635 of our ATMs are operating throughout the entire Island",neg,train
These metrics represents significant progress from the weeks nearly powering the storm,neg,train
And the last question is almost always I would imagine has to be electronic versus cash so that should also benefit debit and credit too correct?,neg,train
Interest on principal on July 1 and interest on January 1,neg,train
"In the interim period, prior to the next payment, all property taxes for mortgaged residential and commercial properties are collected in escrow by the servicing bank and remitted to a central collection agent for the municipalities",neg,train
"It is on most consumer products mortgage not the case because of the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mae program FHAVA, they have asked us to continue to waive late payment fees on mortgages, but on the consumer products yes the moratorium late payment fees is over",neg,train
So we’ll see some return to normal but it won’t be 100% right at the beginning,neg,train
"While much of a discussion of 2017, naturally centers on the impact in hurricane, the year also included important accomplishment",neg,train
"business by 16%, increased our total despite base by 17%, and achieved a slightly kind in deposit cost despite rising rates",neg,train
"On the capital front, we also repurchased 75 million of our common stock and increased our quarterly common dividend by $0",neg,train
"Turning to Slide number 9, to discuss credit metrics for the quarter",neg,train
"As discussed in the introduction, almost every credit quality metric for Puerto Rico has been affected by the moratorium post Hurricane Maria",neg,train
"Overtime, we expect these yields decline as a result of repayments and loan resolutions",neg,test
The natural runoff of this portfolio has slowed considerably in recent quarters,neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, the slower runoff was aided by the payment moratorium offered to clients",neg,train
"As discussed by Ignacio and Carlos, Hurricanes Maria and Irma have had a significant impact on our Puerto Rico operations, including the reported credit quality metrics and our assessment of the allowance for loan losses",neg,train
"Our top exposure are to four large municipalities in the San Juan metro area, Carolina, where the airport and several major tourist hotels are located, San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, Guaynabo, the municipality with the highest per capita income and Bayamon, the second most populous municipalities",neg,train
"To summarize, Hurricanes Maria and Irma had a significant impact on the reported Puerto Rico credit quality metrics and our assessment of the allowance for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2017",neg,train
", the taxi medallion portfolio impacted the credit metrics for the region",neg,train
"Non-performing assets including covered loans decreased by $44 million from $788 million in the prior quarter to $743 million this quarter, driven by NPL decrease of $35 million coupled with an order decrease of $9 million",neg,train
I don’t think it’s fair to correlate but I don’t think we should get you know…,neg,train
Treasury and sent a letter down to the Island earlier this week saying that the government wouldn’t release some loan funds until the central government accounted for some of their deposits,neg,train
Do you expect that to have any impact on your government deposit balances in the near term?,neg,train
"Total operating expenses for the quarter were $322 million, up $5 million on the impacts from the storm including occupancy expense and business promotion",neg,train
"We also saw higher professional fees, as many activities and projects were delayed into the fourth quarter",neg,test
"We expect Hurricane Maria to continue to have an impact on our revenues in 2018, particularly in some income lines, but on a smaller magnitude that in the last two quarters",neg,train
"The strong results, our Dodd-Frank Stress Test were made public in October",neg,train
Timing of any announcement related to Popular’s actions would likely come in the middle of the year,neg,train
"Our overall asset yields were steady, although in this quarter, we experienced some variation due to the effect of payment moratoriums and fee waivers in Puerto Rico",neg,train
"We don’t have that number in handful in commercial, but I can tell you anecdotally most of the clients that have been and to pay some after few month to bridge the insurance",neg,train
"And wanted to talk about the margin, I just want to go through your balance sheet actually pretty asset sensitive or I think more so than people realize, so wanted just to talk about the impact of additional fed hikes from here and then what you bought in the quarter on the securities book, it looks like it had been pretty short duration stuff given flattish linked quarter performance and yields?",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] And so it appears to be no other questions, this will close our question-and-answer session",neg,train
"This conference call is now closed is now over, you can please disconnect",neg,train
"At the end of the quarter, we have no direct exposure to the Puerto Rico central government or its public corporations",neg,train
Our municipality exposure consists mainly of senior priority loans to a select group of municipalities whose revenues are largely independent of the central government,neg,train
The next question comes from Josh Stirling with Off Wall Street,neg,train
"For the full year 2018, we expect quarterly operating expenses to average 228 million, higher than our recovering run rate, due to the investment in these growth initiatives as well as other efforts such as strengthening the bank’s cyber security, continued compliance of regulatory investments and the implementation of [indiscernible]",neg,train
So I think you are not going to see a very large impact in the immediate future,neg,train
"We’ll have to keep an eye on it what are in tales in terms of growth in that industry, but I don’t think you’ll see an immediate impact",neg,train
"Second question is you mention that December this year exceeded December last year, have those trends continue the January?",neg,train
The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair,neg,train
"I’m not sure that letter will but obviously what the letter was looking into was to more transparency into the amount of the funds the Puerto Rico government had, where they were and whether they were restricted because remember these community loans are supposed to be emergency last resort fund",neg,train
So the federal government wanted to have given the fact there was a lot of publicity about almost $6 billion in local banks,neg,train
They wanted to make sure that it was in fact last resort funds,neg,train
We are happy to have lower tax rate in the stage but I don’t think that drives a relative where we invest our dollar,neg,train
"Now please turn to Slide 4, as Carlos discussion our financial results in further detail",neg,train
I don’t - the continuing resolutions of the past or the resolution of the past in the past have been aggregate numbers which have not segregated per jurisdiction,neg,test
I don’t know what they’re going to do in the new one then with people have been trying to get a specific amount earmarked for Puerto Rico but the resolutions that have been passed to date have not had earmarks per jurisdiction,neg,train
The next question comes from Jordan Hymowitz with Philadelphia Financial,neg,train
Maybe also that we have our contact with a number of our commercial clients,neg,train
"I will say the majority of them are either open or partially open, one that we have contacted, the majority of them have some type of insurance",neg,train
"In terms of business activity, we continue experienced strong commercial loan production on our U",neg,train
business and we also saw improved commercial loan production in Puerto Rico,neg,train
Sort of a number around because you were relatively clear about the on the personal sides that you were actually seeing repayments so far this year in line with - this point last year,neg,train
"3%, down 33 basis points, reflecting our adjusted operating earnings, offset by the payment of our quarterly common stock dividend and an increase in risk weighted assets",neg,train
DTA had no impact on our regulatory capital position or the related ratios,neg,train
"Before we start, I would like to remind you that on today's call, we may make forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties",neg,train
"Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and are detailed in our SEC filings, our financial quarterly release and supplements",neg,train
You may find today's press release and our SEC filings on our webpage at popular,neg,train
"Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on and just reconfirm",neg,train
"So I think where I heard you say in the scripted comments was that a third of the clients are non-current as of the end of the year, and I think you said it was all categories and not just mortgages",neg,train
"I wanted to make sure that facts that I got was true and then if it is, clearly you made that there was better performance in auto, credit cards, and personal loans and wondering if you can give a sense of magnitude of the performance improvement?",neg,train
There have been much discussion of the population on the Island due to the increase in our migration after the hurricane,neg,train
There is no doubt that the trend that we have been observing in recent years have accelerate since hurricane,neg,train
That been said some of the members have been published appear to us to be overstated,neg,train
"In terms of the commercial portfolio, I think as I mentioned some of the color that I have as part of all the earlier questions, we have contacted most of our clients, we are happy to say that most of our clients have returned to operations either completely or partial basis, most of them had insurance",neg,train
"A couple more questions, dollar amount of 8 on CR is EMR [ph] the Puerto Rico yesterday yet?",neg,train
"And then second, if there is relief for the smaller banks, you know there is talk as you guys know to more the designation to banks up to 250 billion from 50 billion and possibly other relief for smaller banks, is that happens to pass and you don’t officially have to go through DFAST because your size, would that change your approach in talking to the regulators about return in capital or how could it change the approach to that?",neg,train
Consumer loan origination is currently approximately 80% of 2017 pre-hurricane levels,neg,train
"Yeah, may I - hi and welcome to the call",neg,test
"The - well, first of all where we will be required to do a new DFAST come in the second part of this year is in question",neg,train
I think a robust capital discussion were also includes DFAST like analysis in any sort,neg,train
And I believe that is always included in our consultations with them,neg,train
"So at this point in time, we have - you are correct and that we have historically tied our timetable to DFAST filing",neg,train
"With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks",neg,train
Please turn to Slide 3 to touch up on fourth quarter highlights,neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, Popular reported a net loss of $1",neg,train
2 million including the effects of the $168 million tax adjustment,neg,train
Adjusted net income was $66 million compared to last quarter’s reported net income of $21 million,neg,train
The next question comes from Joe Gladue with Merion Capital Group,neg,train
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr,neg,train
Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call,neg,train
"Today I am joined by our CEO, Ignacio Alvarez, our CFO Carlos Vazquez and our CRO, Lidio Soriano",neg,test
They will review our fourth quarter and full year results and then answer your questions,neg,train
They will be joined in the Q&A session by other members of our management team,neg,train
The Island was facing structural problems which have been in years and we now have a unique opportunity to tackle these problems,neg,train
"Not to go back to where we were but to make important structural changes in areas such as energy, housing, health and education",neg,train
"Excluding the impact of Hurricane Maria, our fourth quarter results reflected strong margins, healthy net interest income and stable credit metrics",neg,train
"Maria impacted our results for the quarter in several revenue expense category, due to the disruption of operations following the hurricane",neg,train
Some of these factors are temporary but an event of this magnitude that undoubtedly have longer term effects,neg,train
We face serious challenges but there also been many opportunities,neg,train
Credit quality metrics include the effects of hurricane related relief measures for our customers,neg,train
"We have offered a more term on consumer, residential and commercial loans and wave late payment fee",neg,train
Nearly all these payments ended during the quarter but to have an impact on both full year and fourth quarter in credit metrics,neg,train
Carlos Vazquez - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President,neg,train
"As all of you know, in September, Puerto Rico was impacted by two major hurricanes",neg,train
"While Irma caused significant damage to the Virgin Islands and interrupted our business activity for a short time in Florida and Puerto Rico, Maria's impact on Puerto Rico was extensive",neg,train
"Although Puerto Rico have made meaningful progress in its recovery efforts, we are still experiencing challenges in the restoration of electric power",neg,test
"The corporation allowance for loan losses decreased by $24 million from the prior quarter, driven by a decrease of $18 million in the U",neg,train
", due to the previously mentioned taxi medallion charge-off of $32 million",neg,train
"At the end of the third quarter, our taxi medallion portfolio had an unpaid principal balance of $232 million",neg,train
"Net of reserve, the current value of this portfolio is $82 million or approximately 36% of its UPV, representing less than 1% of our total loan portfolio",neg,train
"95% of the taxi portfolio is in New York City with an average current loan volume of 233,000 per medallion",neg,train
"The provision for loan losses decreased by $88 million quarter-over-quarter, as the prior quarter included $66 million related to Hurricane Maria estimated impact on our Puerto Rico loan portfolio and $37 million related to taxi portfolio in the U",neg,train
"First of all, as we said on the scripted comment, the debit and credit card volume in December actually exceeded December 2016 numbers, so we’re seeing much more activity",neg,train
"It’s hard to tell because when a card not present, it could be someone ordering something over the Internet or it could be in a state, so we really don’t we don’t have that breakdown",neg,test
So those are the type of things that people are doing,neg,train
"And frankly I believe those things are nice but the end of the day, what you do is get the economy moving and that’s what’s going to keep people here and bring them back",neg,train
"(NASDAQ:BPOP) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2017 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
"I first wanted to just drilldown a little bit more into the deposit inflows you guys saw this quarter, I mean a $1",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
This is so complicated and I appreciate you guys taking the time,neg,train
"If you were to map this like based on all that complexity if you were to sort of look forward and say March 31st or June 30th you are thinking about delinquency data, like what should we expect",neg,train
I am not asking you to forecast the future but just the accounting for the sounds complicated and I think that’s where we would all benefit having a better sense of what it is that we should anticipate?,neg,train
Lidio Soriano - Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer,neg,train
"And then just fine, maybe Lidio you can share some thoughts on the medallion portfolio",neg,train
If I recall you guys when you brought it on to your books you guys did a good job of marking it down to the approximate value at the time,neg,train
"Can you give us some further color, is it just a deterioration in the value of the medallions in New York that’s caused you to have to write it down further?",neg,train
"I had the number verses December of last year but I mean to pre-storm, I think it’s certainly I mean August for December, I think it’s certainly higher than August, yeah definitely",neg,train
"Definitely higher than August, I compared December because of the seasonality of the Christmas holiday season, but it’s definitely higher than August",neg,train
"Power generation is currently at approximately 85% of normal production, up from 30% at the end of October, now reaching approximately 67% of all customers",neg,train
"According to the Army Corp engineers latest estimate, substantially all of Puerto Rico should have electricity restores by the end of February",neg,train
"Consumer activity has picked up and in some cases, it’s close to pre-hurricane levels",neg,train
Debit and credit card activity after the storm was severely impacted by power and telecom service interruptions,neg,train
"For the month of December, our clients’ credit and debit card transaction activity exceeded December 2016 levels",neg,train
"You also made a statement you think that the numbers being bandied about the number of people leaving Puerto Rico is way overstated, other than looking at your company which just one company might not be a good indicator, why do you believe since those numbers are overstated?",neg,test
Some of the smaller clients we have given them another 30 or 60 days especially if you any insurance claim pending and it’s a way to sort of bridge the insurance claim as it comes it,neg,train
But normally we are seeing our commercial clients you know coming back to payment without problem,neg,train
"I think the rest commentary as Ignacio, we know what our clients, and but it’s hard to reach",neg,test
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
Despite the interruption to the operation of many business on the Island and was only down 3% in November compared to August,neg,train
"I mean obviously we don’t accrue any interest, we don’t expect to receive, I mean that’s the basic accounting rules",neg,train
So all the interest we have we expect to receive but I don’t think we have that breakdown between accrued versus actually cash received,neg,train
"For the fourth quarter, we’ve recorded 168 million tax expense due to the impact of the U",neg,train
"For 2018, we expect our tax rate to be between 21% and 24% incorporating the effects of U",neg,train
"I guess trying to dig in a little bit further into and I think it’s very surprising to have debit and credit volume up year-over-year in December, I am just trying to, do you have a feel was that of the sustainability of that metric and is some of that driven or you think that’s being driven materially by relief efforts or is it driven by market share?",neg,train
"Well the aid to individuals is primarily electronic, you’re right, most of the FEMA tries to have it done on product, they do believe or not do still you still issue checks for certain people, but most of the aid to individuals is electronic",neg,train
The hurricane’s effects on revenues for the fourth quarter was a decline of approximately 20 million,neg,test
Storm related expenses in the fourth quarter were 7 million,neg,train
"While responding to the many hurricane related challenges, Popular continues to invest in our future",neg,train
"mainland are expected to diversify our origination channels and contribute to the company’s profitability overtime, though these initiatives will have a larger effect on expense in 2018",neg,train
Both of these initiatives have been in the works for couple of years but only now becoming visible in our financial results,neg,train
"The numbers that I’ve seen and we have some people, again it’s across the board again, again there is not and I see and I’ve asked for some reason numbers but again these are these are basically surveys",neg,train
Traditionally in Puerto Rico the last two years that there has been - the bias in anything was to use versus education,neg,train
"In fact if you look at it just on university level, the people who are leaving tend to have a lower level of university education than the population in general",neg,train
"That has been the trend prior to the hurricanes, I’m not sure that has changed, I don’t think it has from the early data we’ve seen",neg,train
"On the commercial side, we have seen higher demand from financing from clients, they are taking advantage of opportunities that a reason as a result of hurricane",neg,train
"We look forward to 2018, aware the challenges we face, but energized and committed to continuing deliver results and ordering that trust and support",neg,train
"So that is the hard - you asked an interesting question that we tried to get our answer around, but it’s actually hard to reach a conclusion from the data because the data has all limitation",neg,test
"Looking beyond the immediate impact and the recovery process, the Island’s longer term economic prospects will depend on the decisions regarding Puerto Rico’s rebuilding",neg,train
We also have indirect lending facilities in which the government acts as a guarantor,neg,train
Our unique franchise in Puerto Rico places us in a strong position to successfully manage both,neg,train
"As you can see of Slide 12, we have consistently grown our retail and commercial client base",neg,train
7 million customers or approximately 67% of Puerto Rico’s bank population,neg,train
"Notwithstanding the continued economic recession in Puerto Rico and the effects of the hurricane, we were able to grow our deposits in Puerto Rico by $4",neg,train
"3 billion and our customer base by 34,000 customers in 2017",neg,train
It was good to hear the early results from the consumer portfolio,neg,train
"I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about you know what other efforts you are doing to help get a view into potential risk there, how confident are you in terms of our current estimates of potential loss and when the timing you’ll see in getting that kind of confirmation, is it just the delinquency low rate trends that we’ll see over the next few months? Thanks",neg,train
Popular’s tangible book value per share dropped by only $0,neg,train
DTA and the effect of the worst hurricane in nearly century,neg,train
These strong capital results are testament to the resiliency of our operations and the strength of our business model,neg,train
"Very quickly, appreciate the color on your employee base, we got a lot of headlines on negative population outflow, does not seem you’re anywhere close there under your employee base, but are you seeing any trends maybe on the credit and debit card transactions side, for example maybe more transactions taking place in the mainland from your account sources maybe the same time last year?",neg,train
"For the fourth quarter, non-interest income excluding FDIC loss-share activity, decreased by $21 million, mostly due to the effect of Hurricane Maria on fees, and the write-down of our MSR",neg,train
FDIC loss-share expense decreased $7 million as a result of the quarterly evaluation of the FDIC true-up liability,neg,train
"That the reason I think is it is more of a methodology I’ve read in some press releases that some people for example in Florida were measuring the amount of migration by the number of people got on airplane and went to Puerto Rico to Florida without counting literally how many people may have come back, just how many people got on a plane from Florida from Puerto Rico went to Florida in those months",neg,train
So those members by definition to me be exaggerated because I’ve gone to Florida four times after the storm and I haven’t migrated four time,neg,train
"Government has been very instrumental in stemming the brain drain, there are certain sentence that are given to the doctors income taxes, can you clarify and they had stopped what the government is doing to not only that but bring people back to Puerto Rico?",neg,train
And if I could just make one more quick more of an accounting question,neg,train
So obviously your earnings in the past couple quarters have been a lot of driven by accrual policy you know there’s a lot of customers who aren’t paying their loans but you’re still recognize interest on them in your building and unpaid balance on the balance sheet,neg,train
I’m wondering if you can give us a like the number of the incremental growth in the unpaid balance due to customers basically from the interest that you recognize but not actually received and the principle that you have expected to be paid but hasn’t been received since the storm and then I’ll drop off for someone else?,neg,train
"Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $387 million, up $9 million from the third quarter on higher loan volume as well as higher volumes and rates on investments",neg,train
"The reduction is mostly due to asset mix, as balances in our lower yielding investment portfolio",neg,train
"Hurricane Maria negatively affected many parts of our business, including credit and debit cards processing income, ATM fees and the pace of mortgage originations",neg,train
"And on the mortgage side, on the residential mortgage side since the beginning of the year, what puts, what’s been the change there?",neg,train
"No, I don’t think it’s being driven by relief efforts, I think there’s a couple of things that may be impacting it",neg,train
"One is the moratorium, obviously people were given a chance not to pay their credit and auto loans, mortgages loans",neg,train
"Second of all people were not paying the electricity bills because all people didn’t have electricity or water, so they were saving utility bills",neg,train
"And so I think that a lot of people went out to dinner and if you don’t have electricity, it’s hard to a cook at home",neg,train
So I think a lot of people are going out,neg,train
Do you have any indicators of whether the people who might be migrating are lower or higher income than those that are not?,neg,train
"What the margin, what do you expect the margin to be higher from here assuming additional Fed hikes?",neg,train
"I guess just wondering, I guess recognizing the issue with your currency but does the new lower tax rate corporate tax rate affects your calculus on thoughts on further investments in the U",neg,train
"While the hurricanes were undoubtedly devastating, they also brought out the best in people on the Island and beyond",neg,train
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues who for the past four months have demonstrated their unwavering commitment to organization,neg,train
Our customers for their continued support and our shareholders for their trust,neg,test
"And if you could just help me on it was very helpful to receive the transaction number for December, I guess if you could state that or do have a number how that relates to kind of pre-storm levels I think that’s how you provided on the last call?",neg,test
I think it’s too early to tell the provisions or tax are complex unlike 936 which effected most companies,neg,train
"So you could expect that you know it would affect more the pharmaceutical and the medial instrument than other industries, it will not affect foreign operations in Puerto Rico, so we have number four on pharmaceutical",neg,train
I think most of these companies are looking at how this measure is going to work out,neg,train
The next question comes from Alex Twerdahl with Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
The cost of our interest bearing deposits was down 2 basis points to 54 basis points on the lower cost of deposition across products Puerto Rico,neg,train
This was offset slightly by higher yields on money market deposits in the U,neg,train
"operations, the commercial portfolio grew 4% in the fourth quarter and we continue to see a strong pipeline",neg,train
"After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions",neg,train
You guys are doing a super job and a sterling reputation,neg,train
As a quick example Carlos was mentioning the big box stores like Costco would probably clear to a big merchant acquiring back in the States,neg,train
We all knew even before that statement that electricity was one of the obstacles for growth in Puerto Rico and that had to be changed dramatically,neg,train
"I think privatization obviously is a good solution if it’s done well, transparently, so we look forward to it, actually we look forward to the process",neg,train
It have to go through that you there’s a proceeding but yeah I think it’s a step in the right direction that the government has announced that policy decision,neg,train
"Yeah, I mean we are obviously in favor and happy to see any improvement in the regulatory environment",neg,train
But as Ignacio said some other practices have really become management practices now,neg,train
"We don’t do it because they require, we do it because some of these things actually make sense as we run our business",neg,test
Can you bring out the interchange income from EVERTEC or that’s only in the queue?,neg,train
"Our Puerto Rico mortgage business originated $98 million of loans in the fourth quarter, down from $126 million in the third quarter reflecting a significant impact to originations from hurricanes Maria",neg,test
"Despite this drop in production, we have seen origination grow each month since October, we more than half of this quarter’s recognition happening during the month of December",neg,train
"I think what we are seeing is not different, we have seen lot of places have disasters, I think people hold cash for a while and are little bit more conservative so",neg,train
I don’t think what we are seeing is a typical from other jurisdiction they have had major disaster,neg,train
"And then just as importantly I think, you didn’t comment about either commercial loans or residential mortgages since the beginning of the year, I’d love to get a sense if we can real type snapshot on what’s going on those two important loan books and all that be really helpful? Thank you",neg,train
When we’re thinking of the other income line another few items in there your bank in the Dominican Republic or that your ownership runs through there as well but I guess you know it’s stable compared to 3Q but still down from the first half of 2017,neg,train
How should we think about that line as we progress through 2018?,neg,train
Please turn to Slide number 10 to discuss NPL inflows,neg,train
"Compared to the previous quarter, NPL inflows decrease by $81 million, mainly due to the moratorium implemented at Hurricane Maria",neg,test
"Maybe to clarify, what we said in the prepared remarks was two third of our portfolio has continue to make - of our mortgage portfolio has continue to make payments despite the moratorium",neg,train
"So even though we offer them or they were label to for the moratorium, they continue to make payment as scheduled",neg,train
"So it doesn’t means that one third are delinquent, so just mean that two third continue to make payments",neg,train
"And in terms of the capital actions, one of the pushbacks I got from the recent initiation was the timing of that, do you feel as though you have to go through DFAST with the fed again, so potentially push that back as the capital actions towards the end of the year, how confident you think you’ll be able to have capital return in the middle of the year?",neg,train
"So there if you want to call it a brain drain in that sense, it isn’t, there isn’t a more a higher level of university graduates leaving, it’s really across the population, the bias being used",neg,train
"One thing that did change a bit from the hurricane, we don’t know its permanent or not, is that we saw more elderly people leave Puerto Rico because of the health situation and the access to medical treatment",neg,train
"Whether those older people will come back, over stay with their relatives in Florida or else United States that we don’t know",neg,train
But generally you do not see a bias toward higher education,neg,train
"The medical profession, we have seen a higher number of doctors leave, so that is something there",neg,train
"But in general, university education is slightly higher in the general population than the migrating population",neg,train
"NPLs increased by $2 million, driven by the consumer portfolio",neg,train
"At the end of the fourth quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio decreased to 2",neg,train
The decrease in OREOs was mainly driven by lower inflows due to the suspension of a foreclosure activity as a result of hurricanes Maria,neg,train
"Well there are different incentives, for the doctors, they recently pass legislation, they will give specialist a tax exemption, I don’t know if it was 90%, I don’t know exact number, but certain tax exemption income for special is that’s one of the things that they’re doing",neg,train
"In terms of youth there’s a law that I think the first $40,000 of income for people under 26 would exempt",neg,train
"I mean the - the point is Ignacio’s point that it was actually not public deposits, there is a lot of core client flows, private clients and individual clients and commercial clients",neg,train
"DFAST that our clients are not making payments on their loans and mortgages or don’t have to make payments many of them are, those have to have slightly higher bonds in their account",neg,train
Please turn to slide number eight to begin the discussion,neg,test
"Our current outstanding direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, municipalities and other instrumentalities is $484 million, increasing by $2 million from the prior quarter, mainly driven by line of credit utilization",neg,train

"Yeah, so lot of this, Josh, is about doing a lot of our core infrastructure",neg,train
And it doesn’t mean that we won’t have some refreshes like all companies out there in out years,neg,train
We just need to shut them down and we need to get ourselves down to two or three,neg,train
"But there’s lots of business brokers out there calling on agents, basically saying, we can get you a lot of money for your business and the prices are at an all-time high, you ought to look at it",neg,train
So that sparked some conversations that maybe heretofore two or three years ago wouldn’t have occurred,neg,train
This slide presents certain GAAP and non-GAAP financial highlights after removing the impact of the change in acquisition earn-out payables for the fourth quarter of each year and the impact of the Tax Reform Act in the fourth quarter of 2017,neg,train
"Since these items are either non-cash and the earn-out payables can fluctuate by quarter, we believe it is helpful to evaluate the business excluding these adjustments",neg,train
"With the first year completed of our retail performance incentive plan, we considered to be a success",neg,train
"We have more commission producers on the team and our commission books of business grew more than last year, these were all goals of the program",neg,train
We do believe some of the increased performance in the fourth quarter related to producers striving to attain their full year target,neg,train
"We will then true-up the accruals in the following year, when cash is received",neg,train
"Our previous practice was to recognized contingent commissions, when the cash was received",neg,train
For employee benefits and workers’ compensation we will now recognize a larger portion of this revenue upon binding of coverage rather than our previous practice recognizing the revenue when billed,neg,train
"Our income before income tax margin decreased by 20 basis points for the quarter, substantially offsetting the EBITDAC drivers noted above were lower acquisition earn-outs and intercompany interest",neg,train
And the $4 million to $8 million of expense benefit you mentioned in 2018 from the revenue recognition changes,neg,train
Is that - so did you say that $4 million to $8 million in 2018 will then subsequently reverse? Just want to make sure I understood that correctly,neg,train
"Actual results or events in the future are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and may differ materially from those currently anticipated or desired or referenced in any forward-looking statements made as a result of a number of factors",neg,train
"Do you think that we might see a sequential slowdown because of that? I know you don’t give guidance, but just some kind of color on the growth outlook just in context of the pickup you saw in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"With that, let me turn it back over to April for the Q&A",neg,train
"So that doesn’t mean we weren’t going to be doing these things, some of these things",neg,train
But some of that spend has been accelerated because of that need,neg,train
Yes - and can you - have you disclosed like what are the actual margins on the claims processing revenues? Is it basically pure margin?,neg,train
"Our adjusted income before income tax margin grew slightly faster than adjusted EBITDAC, due to lower interest expenses we’ve been paying down outstanding debt",neg,train
"Elyse, let me see - I’ll tackle your first one pretty quickly",neg,train
"As we mentioned in our comments, we said that the total organic was 9",neg,train
"And if you isolate the flood impact, it’s about 430 basis points",neg,train
I was looking at the updated information technology spend plan,neg,train
"Andy, I know this is like right in your wheelhouse; you’ve done a whole career",neg,test
"My closing comments about what we plan to do with it: one, being invested in current and future teammates; two, in innovation; and three, in M&A",neg,test
And thank you so much for the comprehensive review of - especially on tax and the accounting changes,neg,train
"If you look at the different components, that the IT investment, the incremental margin impact probably will be minimal in 2018",neg,train
"And the 5 for 5 programs, the margin impact should be less than 2017",neg,train
"And I just wonder if you see that your organic growth now accelerating, will we see overall margin expansion in 2018?",neg,train
"Later in the presentation, we’ll discuss the movements of our margins in more details",neg,train
"Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, including those related to the company’s anticipated financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2017, and are intended to fall within the Safe Harbor provisions of the securities laws",neg,train
We made a lot of progress in 2017 regarding our technology initiative,neg,train
"Well, remember, Kai, Number one, we don’t give organic growth guidance",neg,train
"And so, as you know, we have been consistent in saying that, we believe that it is a low- to mid-single-digit organic growth business in a steady-state economy",neg,test
"And I just want to follow-up on Kai’s question about private equity, and deal pipeline and whatnot",neg,test
"From what I understand, and maybe it’s incorrect, it seem like that the tax law is going to benefit you relative to private equity in trying to make these deals",neg,train
"Is there any truth in that? Or, you know, I mean can you help give us your outlook kind of what the tax plan does for strategic buyers as opposed to financial buyers?",neg,train
We will also need to defer a portion of our commissions our new business with the deferral primarily impacting our retail segment,neg,test
"As a result, our EBITDAC margin will benefit slightly from this cost deferral in 2018, then commission expense will increase over 15 year period as the annual deferral is amortized",neg,train
We estimate the net deferral of expenses for 2018 to be approximately $4 million to $8 million,neg,train
And we appreciate your time and look forward to talking to you at the end of our Q1,neg,train
"Yes, this is still a gray area as it relates to the IRS and when working through these pieces",neg,train
They’re supposed to come out in sometimes around the middle of March with additional guidance,neg,train
"But at least the areas that had at least been talked about right now, Elyse, is anything from sports tickets, golf, your country clubs that could be out there, any sort of events that you go to",neg,train
"As it relates to claims processing revenues, we had provided guidance that we expected $6 million to $8 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2018",neg,train
"Due to realizing more revenue in the fourth quarter of last year, we now estimate the remaining claims processing revenues to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million, as substantially all claims have been closed",neg,train
"Excluding these revenues, our organic growth was 5% for the quarter",neg,test
"9%, and our diluted earnings per share increased by 222% to $1",neg,train
"As Powell mentioned, as part of the Tax Reform Act, we had to revalue our federal deferred tax liabilities down by approximately $123 million, and also, recorded a repatriation tax of approximately $3 million",neg,train
"8% this quarter, partially driven by claims processing revenues associated with Hurricane Harvey and Irma, along with increased new business across the division",neg,train
"As the quarter continued on and including 1/1 renewals, the proposed rate increases moderated downward",neg,train
"And we experienced general rate increases of flat to 5%, depending on loss experience",neg,train
"So, Elyse, your second question, the answer to the question to me right now is, we don’t know",neg,train
"And you could say, well, the only experience we’ve had with this before, it was only a one-year or one-half-year program",neg,train
"And so, I think that we - everybody is equally as motivated on January 23 of [indiscernible] business, 5% or more, than they were in the fourth quarter of 2017",neg,train
"Brown & Brown Insurance (NYSE:BRO) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2018  8:00 AM ET",neg,train
"So if you look back what we presented on Slide 19, and hopefully this graph helps with everybody, is we were a little bit slower starting the programs than originally anticipated but not unusual for all of these",neg,train
"And as we kind of continued on through 2017, we picked up momentum",neg,train
"We think, we are at kind of full spend right now, so the impact between 2017 and 2018 will be de minimis",neg,train
"Then what happens in 2019, 2020 and thereafter is we start gaining the benefits or the synergies out of the program",neg,train
That’s how we capture our margin back and brings us back up to our original baseline,neg,train
"For the quarter, our income before income tax increased 79% impacted by the EBITDAC drivers we just mentioned as well as lower intercompany interest expense",neg,train
"Due to the quarterly volatility in the National Programs’ EBITDAC margin, we wanted to provide guidance for 2018, which we would estimate to be in the range of 33% to 35%, due to lower expected contingence, lower claims revenues and the full year impact of the investment in our Core Commercial program",neg,train
"As many of you know, 60%-plus of all deals done last year were done by private equity, and we don’t expect this trend to change much in 2018",neg,train
You mentioned that the tax benefit is going to be about $45 million to $50 million per year,neg,train
And how much of that are going to flow through the bottom line versus reinvest in the business or sort of lower price for your customers?,neg,test
"On Slide 5, we’re pleased with the full year performance as we deliver $1,881",neg,test
"2%, which is 60 basis points and reflects the investments we’ve been making in our business",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] We’ll take our next question from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank,neg,train
And it’s really around just doing all the conversions within retail and upgrading on the agency management system,neg,train
We’ll discuss our expectation for 2018 effective tax rate later in the presentation,neg,train
"Moving over to Slide #18, this presents the impact upon our 2017 effective tax rate and a walk to our estimated effective tax rate for 2018",neg,train
The primary impacts for 2017 are the estimated reevaluation of our deferred tax liabilities and the deemed repatriation tax,neg,train
And so they just have more months to hit the bell,neg,test
"But I would say that, we feel good about the results on 5 for 5 for 2017",neg,train
But we just don’t know to be specific on your question,neg,train
"As discussed during our Q2 earnings call, the Core Commercial program will initially be dilutive to margins as we invest in building our platform and we’ll also incur transition services cost",neg,train
On an adjusted basis our earnings per share was $0,neg,test
"We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise",neg,train
"For the quarter, our EBITDAC margin was down 280 basis points and was driven by a non-cash stock based compensation credit in the prior year, which benefited the margin last year by 120 basis points",neg,train
Our producer incentive plan which impacted margin for the current year by 120 basis points and the investment to upgrade our agency management systems was 50 basis points margin impact this quarter,neg,train
"On the acquisition front, we only closed 11 transactions with $17 million of annualized revenue in 2017",neg,train
"On the weather-related claims processing, I know you said that should be $2 million to $3 million now in 1Q 2018",neg,train
"So just to clarify, is the $2 million to $3 million higher year-over-year? Or would it imply that it should be about flat year-over-year?",neg,train
Our earnings per share excluding this onetime benefit was $0,neg,train
"We would not - on a full year, we would not expect a margin impact versus 2017",neg,train
"There might be a little bit in the first half of the year, but then we start our way back out of this",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
So no - so there shouldn’t be an impact on margins in 2018 that’s what you just said?,neg,test
"For 2018, our federal tax rate will decrease to 21% but will be partially offset by the lower federal benefit of state tax deductions",neg,test
"As part of the new tax bill, all compensation over $1 million for a company’s CEO, CFO and the next three highest-paid Section 16 officers, will now be non-deductible",neg,train
We estimate these two items will increase our full year rate by approximately 2%,neg,train
They are pricing deals at things that - or seeking returns of maybe 12% or 14%,neg,train
"And so, the answer to the question is, when you have new money in the market, with people that may not know about the insurance business, then they’re going to make some decisions to do some things that we wouldn’t do",neg,train
"Moving over to Slide #11, looking at the performance of each of the divisions a little more closely, we’re going to start with retail",neg,train
"For the fourth quarter, our retail division delivered total revenue growth of 3",neg,train
9% and 4% organic revenue growth driven substantially by all lines of business,neg,train
"And I think, Kai, the other two areas to maybe keep in mind is, with the decline in claims processing revenue associated with storms, that will have an impact on the margins year-over-year",neg,test
"And then, dependent upon exactly where we turn out on contingents and GSCs, our estimate is $6 million to $8 million down that will have some pressure there",neg,train
"And if we told you, it wouldn’t be a secret",neg,train

"Our EBITDAC grew by almost 35% due to the higher than average margins for claims processing, continued leveraging of our revenues and expense management",neg,train
"During the quarter, we had a small net investment and our Core Commercial program, which is in line with our expectations and what we previously communicated in the second quarter of last year",neg,train
"In summary, we’re pleased with the performance of four divisions for the quarter and the full year",neg,train
"Now, let me turn it over to Andy, who will discuss our financial performance in more detail",neg,train
"Hey, Josh, I’d like to make one other point, and I know you’re very familiar with this",neg,train
Our CIO will attest next month for the first part,neg,train
And then we got another thing to attest to a year from February of 2019,neg,train
"With that said, I will now turn the conference over to Powell Brown, President and Chief Executive Officer",neg,train
Andrew Watts - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
"In addition, there are certain non-GAAP financial measures used in the conference call",neg,train
A reconciliation for any non-GAAP financial measures to most comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the company’s earnings press release or in the investors presentation for this call on the company’s website at www,neg,train
"com, by clicking on the Investor Relations and then Calendar of Events",neg,train
"Based upon the trend during 2017 and the losses experienced as a result of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and the California fires, we anticipate a further decline in 2018 of $6 million to $8 million",neg,train
"When we isolate the net impact of M&A activity, our organic revenue growth was 4",neg,train
4% for the year driven by growth in all four divisions,neg,train
"As you know, we attract business owners that see the benefit of joining a larger organization that will provide them the opportunity to maximize our collective capabilities and enhance their entrepreneurial spirit",neg,train
"For the full year, we are able to maintain our outstanding share count, substantially in line with the prior year",neg,train
Each year we seek to minimize the dilutive effect of our equity incentive plans through periodic stock repurchases,neg,train
"And then, in terms of the retail comp-program is it correct that we should expect the impact on margins to be lower in 2018 than 2017?",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"The investment this quarter impacted our margin by approximately 30 basis points, which is in line with our expectations",neg,test
"Moving over to Slide #16, this presents the key components of our full year revenue performance",neg,train
"For the year, we had no material movements in investment income",neg,train
And the change in other income was associated with the $20 million legal settlement we had in the first quarter of 2017,neg,train
"Including all these changes, we anticipate our full year 2018 effective tax rate will be in the range of 27% to 28%",neg,train
The lower tax rate will result in tax savings of approximately $45 million to $50 million per year and will further increase our operating cash to revenue conversion ratio,neg,train
"The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, excluding the $0",neg,train
"4%, which is slightly below recent quarters due to a couple of onetime discrete items along with the true-up of taxes associated with yearend state tax apportionment",neg,train
And we’ll take our next question from Arash Soleimani from KBW,neg,train
"When you get ready to start updating your models for 2018, keep in mind that we anticipate a further reduction on our estimated contingent commissions and GSCs in 2018 due to the large losses associated with hurricanes and the California fires experienced in 2017",neg,train
"Our retail performance incentive plan impacted margins by approximately 60 basis points, which is slightly higher than the first three quarters of 2017",neg,train
"As a reminder, we anticipate this program will impact on margins the most in 2017, less in 2018 than will breakeven in 2019",neg,train
"Over to Slide #12, for the quarter total revenues for our National Programs Division increased by 19",neg,train
"I discussed earlier organic revenue was higher than we anticipated for the quarter, as we realized approximately $22 million of claims processing revenue associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as compared to $3 million that we’ve recognized in the prior year",neg,train
"Isolating this year-over-year impact, our organic growth rate was 2",neg,train
We will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo,neg,train
"And do you think that, do you - do you see that dynamic change in the marketplace?",neg,test
I’m going to give you the just gut response as opposed to the technical response,neg,train
"At the end of the day, I think many of us think of private equity in the truest sense of seeking a 20% return annually",neg,train
"They put things out and it says 20% IRR and this and then blah, blah, blah",neg,train
"As a reminder, for the full year, we estimate the contingents and GSCs could be down between $6 million to $8 million from what we experienced in 2017",neg,train
"However, the largest effect will be within our wholesale and programs division",neg,train
"With that, let me turn it back over to Powell for closing comments",neg,test
I would say that we looked at a number of transactions last year,neg,train
"And, there were several that we would like to have done, that the chemistry was good",neg,train
"But some - in those instances, somebody else was willing to overlook something",neg,train
"And so, we’re thinking about our teammates, our customers, our carrier partners, our shareholders",neg,train
"My first question, if I back out the storm-related revenue in the quarter, it seems like your organic was running around 4%",neg,train
"Is that kind of how you see it? And I guess, I would like to make that a two-part question",neg,train
You guys mentioned that maybe some producers were driving for growth in the fourth quarter towards that retail comp program,neg,train
"For the current quarter, the impact of our investment in technology was about 70 basis points, which is higher than previous quarters",neg,train
This was driven by an acceleration of the phase of implementation associated with certain initiatives,neg,train
"Overall, there has not been a material change in the total estimated spend associated with our IT initiatives",neg,train
"Later in the presentation, we’ll provide an update on the status of this program",neg,test
We’ll walk through the key components of our revenue performance,neg,train
"For the quarter, we had no material movements in investment income or other income",neg,train
"Well, thank you for the details and good luck in 2018",neg,train
The incremental effect of the year-over-year change in the net gain on disposals of certain businesses and books of businesses contributed about 40 basis points to our margin for the quarter,neg,train
"As a reminder, the prior year includes a net loss on disposal of $1",neg,train
Organic revenue growth is the result of increased new business,neg,train
"The increase is attributable to leveraging our organic revenue, continued control of expenses and improvement in the EBITDAC margin of our 2016 acquisitions",neg,train
"Today, we are leveraging our data better to win more new business and create new products to the benefit of our customers",neg,train
"And between now and then three months ago, what was the incremental sort of decision making that went? Did you try to take on another project or just became more expensive? Or like what was the process in extending this out?",neg,train
"Then each year thereafter, we will realize additional savings in order to recapture the impact to our margins",neg,train
We anticipate margins to breakeven around 2021 and to have a slight upside versus our starting baseline margin,neg,train
"As we’ve been disclosing our quarterly filings, effective January 1 of this year, the FASB has instituted several new rules that will impact the recognition of revenue and expenses throughout 2018 and beyond",neg,train
This slide provides our estimate of the effect on each quarter as well as the full year,neg,test
The biggest changes relate to recognizing revenues for contingent commission and commissions on employee benefits and workers’ compensation,neg,train
Contingent commissions were now be estimated and recognized pro rata during the year,neg,train
"Such factors include the company’s determination as it finalizes its financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2017, and its financial results differ from the current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth for the press release issued yesterday, other factors that the company may not have currently identified or quantified",neg,train
"From an expense standpoint, we’re in line with our expectations for the first full year",neg,test
"As a reminder, this is a multi-year program, therefore all targets are reset on 1/1, and each producer needs to grow at least 5% in 2018 in order to earn the incremental incentive for this year",neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

"And just my final question, when you mentioned that part of the tax savings could be deployed into innovation, what exactly do you mean by that, just to give some more color?",neg,train
Our earnings per share for the full year of 2017 increased to $2,neg,train
"When we remove the onetime benefit of the Tax Reform Act, our earnings per share improved $1",neg,train
"As we reflect on 2017, it was a really solid year",neg,train
Each quarter we continued to build momentum and furthered our growth by investing in the business for our long-term success,neg,train
"In summary, we are on track with the estimated cost of the program and expected returns",neg,train
We wanted to mention that we are actively discussing the timing of our quarterly earnings release,neg,test
"In an effort to align the timing of our first three quarters earnings release and to be consistent with the timing of our year end release, we will move all earnings release dates to the fourth Monday of the month and will seek to file our 10-Qs closer to the earnings release date",neg,test
"And so, there’s a lot of people with financial backgrounds that are buying businesses, they’re not - many of them are not insurance people",neg,train
"And that’s typically a short-term time horizon, 3 to 5 to 7 years",neg,train
"And we’re playing for the long game, so it’s different, but it is - they’re closing a lot of deals, a number of them are",neg,train
"Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call",neg,train
"2%, which is down 70 basis points, reflecting the investments discussed in previous quarters and some improvement associated with claims processing revenue related to Hurricane Harvey and Irma",neg,train
"For the quarter, our EBITDAC increased 27% as a result of revenue growth and leveraging our expense base",neg,train
"Our income before income tax increased by 25%, impacted by the EBITDAC drivers and partially offset by a credit in the prior year for the change in acquisition earn-outs",neg,test
"Moving over to Slide #15, this presents certain GAAP and non-GAAP financial highlights after removing the impact of the change in acquisition earn-out payables for the 12 months of each year",neg,train
"So we’ll defer it in 2018, then what we’ll do is we’re going to take 1/15 each year and amortize it back into the P&L",neg,train
"And so the 15 years matches with our estimated useful life of our customers, which we disclose in our 10-K every year",neg,train
"For the full year of 2017, it was adjusted for the legal settlement we had in the first quarter and the onetime impact of Tax Reform",neg,train
"2016 was adjusted for the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09, which changed the treatment of the tax benefit associated with stock incentive plans",neg,train
"Since these items are non-cash or non-recurring, they can increase or decrease by year",neg,train
And we believe it’s helpful to evaluate the business excluding these adjustments,neg,train
"The reason why we don’t disclose it, Arash, is it all depends upon the storm and the nature of the claims",neg,train
"For the full year, we estimate the effect on revenue to be minimal, but the impacts per quarter to be material",neg,train
The primary impact is within the retail segment with the exception of contingent commissions,neg,train
"From an expense standpoint, we’ll now recognize producer compensation when coverage has bound",neg,train
"Our previous practice was to recognize commission expense throughout the year, when premiums were invoiced",neg,test
"2% due to lower contingence and guaranteed supplemental commissions, investments in technology, our retail producer incentive program and the Core Commercial program, which substantially offset margin expansion across many of our businesses",neg,train
"And then my last question on the tech-related investment, so it seems like the right way to think about this that you are seeing more of a margin hit, say, at the end of 2017 and maybe into 2018, but overall that’s why maybe less of a hit in the later years and that’s why the total potential investment has not changed?",neg,train
"1% organic revenue growth, primarily as a result of incremental claims processing revenue associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and our new Arrowhead Core Commercial program",neg,train
We’ve realized approximately $22 million of claims processing revenue associated with these events as compared to the $6 million to $8 million that we mentioned in the third quarter earnings call,neg,train
Our wholesale segment primarily accesses non-admitted markets on behalf of retail agents,neg,train
Think of accounts that typically would not be written by standard admitted companies,neg,train
"These accounts in this market range from big to small, loss-written or loss-free, and can be unusual or unique in nature",neg,train
"Our wholesale business delivered excellent results for another quarter, growing organically 6",neg,train
This growth was realized across almost all lines of coverage,neg,train
We’ll be probably doing anywhere from $25 million to $40 million per year,neg,train
That’s going to take about three years to get through,neg,train
"And, Kai, the reason we also look at it is, that basically it increases our cash flow from operations by about 10%",neg,train
"As we’ve been discussing throughout the year, our expectation was that our contingent commissions would be more than likely decreased due to continued losses and lower premium rates that are shrinking profitability for the risk-bearers",neg,train
"For the year, our combined contingent commissions and GSCs were almost $3 million lower as compared to the prior year",neg,train
"For the quarter, our adjusted income before income tax increased by 10%, and our EBITDAC increased by 6",neg,train
"The difference in growth rates was driven by lower interest expense, as we’ve been paying down our outstanding debt",neg,train
"7%, driven by the lower effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding the impacts of tax reform",neg,train
"At this time, I’d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks",neg,train
"Reductions are due to decrease profitability of our carrier partners caused by lower premium rates, the hurricanes and the California fires during 2017",neg,train
"8% year-over-year, when we isolate the net impact of our M&A activity, our organic revenue growth was 9",neg,train
"3%, driven by solid growth in all divisions along with claims processing revenues primarily recognized in our National Programs Division",neg,train
"Total insured losses associated with the hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 were in the range of $120 billion to $130 billion, with last year being one of the highest loss years ever, I think I read recently, it was the third highest",neg,train
There was no material difference in the growth of income before income tax as compared to EBITDAC,neg,train
"Over to Slide #14, the services division grew revenues 11",neg,train
This growth was driven by increased new business across most of our operations and claims processing revenue associated with Hurricane Irma and Harvey,neg,train
"The remainder of the business contributed 50 basis points on margin expansion, which benefitted from the incremental claims processing revenue associated weather events, continued leveraging of our revenues, disciplined expense management across all divisions and with additional earn-out expenses - or additional earned expenses for certain bonus plans due to stronger performance during 2017",neg,test
"For the fourth quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of 9",neg,train
3 percentage points from the claims processing revenues that Powell discussed earlier,neg,train
"During the quarter, claims closed materially quicker and at a higher value than anticipated, resulting in more revenue this quarter",neg,train
"During the quarter, we also recognized about $4 million of revenue associated with our Core Commercial program",neg,train
"We continue to be pleased with the performance of this program, and it’s in line with our expectations and estimates we shared during our Q2 earnings call",neg,train
The impact on the reinsurance markets to date has not been significant enough to increase property rates like some have thought,neg,train
"After the storms, there’s still capital coming into the marketplace with new sidecar entities being launched and more insurance-linked securities being offered",neg,train
"As a result, property rate increases were more than likely be moderate in 2018 from our perspective",neg,train
Our weighted average number of shares outstanding was substantially flat as a result of our $75 million accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated during the fourth quarter,neg,train
"In a few slides, we’re going to walk through the primary drivers of our EBITDAC margins",neg,train
"From a retail perspective, we grew 4% organically for the quarter and 2",neg,train
"We are really pleased with the fourth quarter and the full year performance, which represents continued improvement as compared to the full year organic growth of 1",neg,train
"The growth for the year was driven by exposure unit expansion, new business, and higher retention levels",neg,train
"And as a result, there will be an impact on our margins due to Core Commercial through 2019",neg,train
"During the quarter, our DIC programs or difference in condition programs performed very well",neg,train
The combination of these programs along with the claims processing revenues and the core commercial program more than offset the loss in revenue associated with carrier changes for other programs we discussed in previous calls,neg,train
"Number two, we’ve outlined several things that we are doing, technology being one, 5 for 5 being another, and other things that we’re investing in the future",neg,train
"And so, we’ve tried to give an indication of sort of where we thought the margin or where we are",neg,test
"Several examples of our over 40 programs include writing AAA construction that’s superior construction on condominiums in Dade Broward and Palm Beach County, flood coverage in flood zones, professional liability for dentists, and earthquake on commercial and residential buildings, just to name a few",neg,train
Our earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $1,neg,train
"85 associated with the recent tax reform, which was primarily driven by the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities",neg,test
Andy will discuss this more in detail later in the presentation,neg,train
"And then in terms of the tax impact, the entertainment deduction that you guys called out that is going away, what kind of entertainment falls in that bucket that you are no longer going to be able to deduct under the new tax legislation?",neg,train
"During the year, we grew the top-line nicely and had good bottom-line expansion, while investing in multiple areas of the business, to help drive more growth and profit in the future",neg,train
Our performance is the direct result of the hard work and dedication of our 8700-plus teammates that strive each day to provide our customers with the best risk-management solutions possible,neg,train
"We’ve already completed certain deliverables and have others underway, which are in line with expectation",neg,train
"The investment phase started slightly slower than anticipated in 2016, but the momentum increased during 2017",neg,train
"So again, as backdrop, it is traditionally meals and entertainment were already 50% non-deductible",neg,train
So what we really did for simplicity is we just took the other 50%,neg,train
And we’re going to wait until we see additional guidance from the IRS exactly what they’ve included in there,neg,train
"In closing, we were very pleased with the performance for the fourth quarter and specifically for the full year",neg,train
"As we anticipated, rate increases for cat properties seem muted now by the existence of fresh capital seeking higher returns",neg,test
"However, having property rates flat to up 5% is a nice improvement over the past couple of years",neg,train
Pertaining to other lines of coverage commercial and personal auto continue to increase the most with rates moving up in the 5% to 10% range,neg,train
We are also seeing professional liability and general liability flat to up slightly,neg,train
"Rate increases from employee benefits continued to rise with small group under 50, seeing the highest rate increases generally of 5% to 10% plus",neg,train
"As mentioned earlier, our technology initiatives are to upgrade and standardize certain platforms across the company and specifically within our retail segment",neg,train
"Good morning, and welcome to the Brown & Brown Incorporated Fourth Quarter Earnings Call",neg,train
"Please note that certain information discussed during this call, including information contained in the slide presentation, posted in the connection with this call and including answers given in response to your questions may relate to the future results and events or otherwise be forward-looking in nature",neg,train
"And, Elyse, we mentioned this on a couple of previous calls and we would just reiterate it now",neg,train
The program is performing almost right in line with exactly what we expected on kind of estimated top-line contribution as well as the investment side,neg,train
The big question everybody is wondering about is how premium rates have changed during the fourth quarter and for our 1/1 renewals,neg,train
"When the quarter started there was a tremendous amount of optimism around possible material rate increases, with many thinking cat property rates would increase 10% to 20%-plus",neg,train
"When we’re at our third quarter earnings call, we were cautious about how much rates might change, as there is always a lot of excitement about what might be, which is tempered by the realism of what really happens",neg,train
Good morning and welcome to the Allegheny Technologies conference call for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017,neg,train
This conference call is being broadcast on our website at atimetals,neg,train
"Participating in the call today are Rich Harshman, Chairman, President and the Chief Executive Officer; Pat DeCourcy, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; John Sims, Executive Vice President, High Performance Materials & Components segment; Bob Wetherbee, Executive Vice President, Flat Rolled Products Group; and Kevin Kramer, Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial & Marketing Officer",neg,train
"Yes, thank you very much for joining us on the call today",neg,train
As always thank you for your continuing interest in ATI,neg,train
"Second, we expect a one-time negative impact related to the required accounting changes on retirement benefit expense, cost capitalization in inventory",neg,train
"For the full-year 2018, we anticipate continued revenue growth in the Flat Rolled Products segment at a high single-digit percentage rate versus 2017, driven by growth in certain strategic markets",neg,train
"This assumption in the following operating margin, expectation assumes relatively stable raw material prices beyond the first quarter of 2018",neg,train
"It will be in the footnote in the 10-K, but I think it's safe to assume, when we look at our long range financial forecasts, we don't expect to be a significant taxpayer at the federal level through 2020",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 12, as you have heard from all of today's presenters, we are optimistic heading into 2018",neg,train
"The outlook for both segments is favorable due to market conditions, actions we have already taken, and long-term agreements with customers already in place",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 8, 2017 saw significant market shifts in the Flat Rolled Products business portfolio",neg,train
"Leading the year-over-year change was the rebound in the oil and gas market, including the hydrocarbon and chemical processing industries, where revenues were up over 50% versus the prior year’s low levels",neg,train
"Today, this market represents nearly 25% of total segment revenue, up from 19% in 2016",neg,test
"With respect to the growth to the $3 billion mark, obviously, aerospace is the largest percent – largest market for High Performance and that will dominate the growth over the next several years",neg,train
We are focused on executing our business plan and our strategic initiatives,neg,train
"As a result, we believe that 2018 will be a year of continued revenue growth, operating margin improvement, and healthy cash flow generation for ATI",neg,train
"I actually think that – yes, I actually think that the impact on Q4 was more of the absence of the out-of-phase surcharge on chrome that we experienced in Q3",neg,test
"If you look at the full-year of 2017 on the Flat Rolled side, I think the impact of the surcharge fluctuation was really minimal in the full-year",neg,train
"Turning to 2017 revenue by product, our strategy to increase sales of high value products continues to bear fruit, with high value revenue up 20% versus the prior year",neg,train
Building our success in previous quarters nickel sheet shipments were at record levels in Q4 2017 and we expect to significantly increase titanium plate revenues over the next few years in support of the recently signed long-term agreements with General Dynamics Land Systems,neg,train
Interest expense is expected to fall to a range of $100 million to $105 million for the full-year 2018,neg,test
This figure is lower than 2017s $134 million expense due to the redemption of the 2019 high coupon rate debt after our November 2017 common equity offering,neg,train
"For the fourth quarter 2017, commercial airframe sales were 4% higher than the prior year",neg,train
"Sales to government and defense markets increased significantly both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year, for both aerospace and non-aerospace applications",neg,train
"In government aerospace, military jet engines and rotorcraft products saw both substantial revenue increases versus the prior year period, while naval nuclear revenues grew significantly on the non-aerospace side",neg,train
"I think that we view over a longer term standpoint, relative stability when you look at fundamentals of nickel in the $5",neg,train
So we're not all that far away from that now,neg,train
"I think that typically speaking in the short-term, a rising LME price generates more favorable short-term results than a falling one does",neg,train
So we're sticking with the 200 basis point improvement year-over-year,neg,train
"If you look at the average for 2017, it was approximately 12% operating margin for the segment and we're looking at 200 basis points up on that for this year",neg,test
"Recapping the year's most significant accomplishments, we increased ATI revenues by 13% versus the prior year, largely due to jet engine production related demand growth as well as recovery in some of Flat Rolled Products segments key markets",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 6, as you can see from the pie chart and related table, we continue to grow our commercial jet engine business as the next-generation engines production rate ramps expand",neg,train
"In 2017, 44% of the High Performance Materials & Components segment revenues came from the commercial jet engine market",neg,train
And the aerospace and defense markets in total comprised 76% of segment sales,neg,train
Please note that all forward-looking statements this morning are subject to various assumptions and caveats as noted in the earnings release and shown on this slide,neg,train
"In your 2018 outlook, how much you factoring in? Now back in November, you expected a moderate or modest benefit",neg,train
I don't remember what you said exactly in 2018 and a full benefit in 2019,neg,train
So I just wanted to get an update there and get how quickly you think that JV will ramp up et cetera?,neg,train
Now I'll hand the call over to Pat DeCourcy to talk about ATI’s fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial performance and some comments about 2018 expectations,neg,train
"So fully aware that you are not a nickel company, but nickel have rallied second half of the year by about a third and so huge moves in nickel and historically nickel-based alloys and stainless have seen both the volume and margin benefit on that kind of move? Is that's something you can quantified at all for us? Can you give us any thoughts on, in a normalized nickel price, how should we think of the delta from some of the strong move in the second half of the year to normalize 2018 assumingly?",neg,train
"Looking at the fourth quarter 2017 in more detail, revenues and operating margins benefited from the improvement in raw material surcharges related to both ferrochrome and nickel versus prior year and sequential quarters",neg,train
Fourth quarter revenues improved 23% versus the same quarter of 2016 across all significant markets,neg,test
"The largest gains were in the oil and gas market, including chemical and hydrocarbon processing industries and the electronics market",neg,train
"Beyond financial results, 2017 was a year of significant milestones in our journey to sustainable profitability in the Flat Rolled Products segment",neg,train
So I think Pat and his team have done really an outstanding job of being proactive in that,neg,train
"And then longer term, I mean, obviously, companies have done some work in terms of annuitizing larger pieces of the liability",neg,train
And the end result would be a continued further strengthening of the balance sheet,neg,test
"2018 retirement benefit expense, which includes both pension and OPEB expense is currently expected to be $52 million, approximately $19 million lower than the 2017 retirement benefit expense",neg,train
And the next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch,neg,train
Scott Minder - Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications,neg,train
The 2022 convertible notes outstanding have a dilutive impact on quarterly earnings per share above certain earnings levels,neg,train
"When considering this impact, it is important to note the both earnings and the dilutive shares need to be adjusted",neg,train
Please feel free to give us a call if you have any questions,neg,train
"This growth rate will be tempered somewhat by continued strong demand, but slower growth in our airframe submarket and ongoing sluggishness in the electrical energy and medical markets",neg,train
"Additionally, we expect a modest decline in some of our defense market sales as certain programs reach the end of their production lifespans",neg,train
"We do have a dedicated team that's engaged in working with our customers actually for the services of the HRPF, we've moved beyond concerns about logistics",neg,train
We've proven with the logistics companies and partners that it's not a problem to brings slabs in from anywhere in the world and processed them on the HRPF,neg,test
The Chinese government has approved and so it's just one other one that were awaiting it's more of – we've been through this before with this particular government,neg,train
"So it's just a matter of following the process, but we don't anticipate any problems with regulatory clearance",neg,train
"Gautam, I think in addition, I mean that that doesn't stay there for – we hope, for a prolonged time period, right",neg,train
"So we should not be anticipating that maybe in Q1, you guys sign an official agreement",neg,train
"Third-party conversion agreements with carbon steel customers, if finalized – would also potentially benefit the second half of the year",neg,train
The timing and magnitude of these developments are difficult to predict resulting in the potential range of margin results,neg,train
Fourth quarter segment operating profit increased 600 basis points over the same period in 2016 due to several factors,neg,train
"Most notably the improvement in product mix, lower cost due to the prior year restructuring activities, ongoing cost discipline and the benefit from increased volumes as well as the previously mentioned raw material surcharge increases",neg,test
"Similar to the fourth quarter, full-year 2017 revenues and operating profit margins increased significantly year-over-year were largely driven by the same factors",neg,test
"In 2019, I’m sorry, what do you anticipate and do nothing more…",neg,train
"2019, if all – if everything holds together, we would be back up around $100 million",neg,train
And the next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company,neg,train
A lot of what we do in High Performance is dependent upon the manufacturing capabilities of Flat Rolled Products segment and vice versa,neg,train
And the next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research Group,neg,train
"Even on nickel, we had some hits early in the year and then some stability and price ups in the second half, but for the full-year it was…",neg,train
I am pleased to report that the initial start up of our facilities and our activity with Tsingshan as well underway,neg,train
We have a full complement of our crewing and our solid organizations coming together,neg,train
"Kevin Kramer - Senior Vice President, Chief Commercial & Marketing Officer",neg,train
"In addition, the range includes $22 million earmarked for the completion of the previously mentioned STAL joint venture expansion in China",neg,train
"In total, these expenditures include strategic investments in capabilities to support our business growth and to maintain our existing asset base to ensure reliability and ongoing product quality",neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Minder, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications",neg,train
We did give some specific items in this earnings release that you can use to help construct the cash flow for the company,neg,train
So we think we gave some very significant items out there that will help you in that guidance,neg,train
"At year-end 2017, we had approximately $305 million of additional available liquidity to us under this credit facility",neg,train
"ATI generated $76 million of cash from operations in the quarter, after a growth in managed working capital of approximately $30 million",neg,train
"This increase was primarily attributable to inventory builds in support of large pipeline project orders for Flat Rolled Products that will be completed in 2018, and the receipt of initial materials to be used by the Allegheny & Tsingshan Stainless joint venture in 2018",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 9, the top section of this slide details our fourth quarter 2017 financial progress, cash on hand at the end of 2017 was $142 million, an increase of $17 million over the third quarter of 2017",neg,train
This was after paying down $25 million of borrowings under our asset-based lending facility or ABL,neg,train
"John Sims - Executive Vice President, ATI High Performance Materials & Components Segment",neg,train
I will now turn the call over to Bob to talk about our performance in the Flat Rolled Products segment,neg,train
"Turning to Slide 11, looking at other important factors for 2018, we expect 2018 contributions to the ATI pension plan will be between $40 million and $50 million compared to $135 million in 2017",neg,train
"As I previously indicated, we anticipate 2018 capital expenditures to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million including joint venture items previously discussed",neg,train
We announced the creation of the joint venture with the Tsingshan Group Company to produce 60 wide stainless steel sheet products,neg,train
market by leveraging our world-class assets and Tsingshan’s innovative and cost effective approach to slab casting,neg,train
We believe that this joint venture will produce a high quality product at a competitive costs and offer much improved product lead times,neg,train
So I'm going to ask you in a bit of a different way,neg,test
"Could you talk about cash conversion in 2018 and maybe beyond that 2019 et cetera? And while we’re on the topic, maybe discuss capital deployment",neg,train
"And specifically, I guess Pat, how much debt do you intend to retire this year and how much progress do you intend to make to get into your interest coverage target?",neg,train
I think there is a value creator for the shareholders of having the businesses together,neg,train
If we're not being rewarded appropriately for that value then I think you look at and consider other strategic actions and we will continue to do that,neg,test
"Turning to Slide 7, our performance in the Flat Rolled Products segment continues to gain traction as evidenced in the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results",neg,train
Although prior year comparisons are favorable in part due to a weak 2016 period that was impacted by the seven-month work stoppage,neg,train
"In summary, 2017 was a year of important strategic achievements and a return to profitability",neg,train
Good morning to everyone on the call and to those listening on the Internet,neg,train
The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a year that saw important progress on several strategic initiatives and showcased ATI’s longer-term financial potential,neg,train
"Now, I'm going to have John Sims to discuss the High Performance Materials & Components segment",neg,train
"John will be followed by Bob Wetherbee, who will discuss the Flat Rolled Products segment, and then Pat DeCourcy will comment in more detail about the fourth quarter results",neg,train
I will then return to provide our 2018 outlook and to make some concluding remarks before we open up the call to Q&A,neg,test
"So yes, when you look at the total loss for the year, it was in the high teens in terms of millions of dollars for the last – for the full-year of 2017, so between $15 million and $17 million, $18 million",neg,train
So if you get close to breakeven that's the magnitude of the turnaround in Cast Products,neg,train
Operating margin results are expected to improve in the second half of the year as compared to the first half due to increasing initial contributions from the joint venture and contributions from the STAL joint venture expansion,neg,train
We're still in kind of the development phase with GE on that program and that program is going well,neg,test
"Just trying to figure out since you did call it out as an item that contributed to strong FRP results in Q4, if we could get any handle on that?",neg,train
"And then with castings, expected to be breakeven in 2018",neg,train
Is there any way to quantify what the headwind was in 2017 on the operating margin in the High Performance?,neg,test
"In terms of the ramp up, we see the first half of the year being the ramp up period and expect to start to see benefit in the second half of 2018 both in the utilization of the HRPF as well as the manufacturing and sale of product through the joint venture",neg,train
"We're still awaiting final regulatory clearance here, which we expect in the next few weeks and should be able to close during the first quarter",neg,train
"So capital deployment, as we mentioned the guidance for CapEx is between $100 million and $125 million, we anticipate definitely being within that range for the full-year",neg,test
There's a substantial improvement coming in cash flow in 2018,neg,train
"Taken together, 2017 was a year of significant progress that we believe will provide a springboard for continued improvement in 2018 and beyond",neg,train
This includes our ongoing efforts to increase utilization rates at our HRPF via third-party conversion agreements,neg,train
"Overall 2017 was a solid year for cash generation, even after considering the $135 million contribution to the ATI defined benefit pension plan made in the first half of the year",neg,train
We believe ATI’s well-positioned to improve on 2017 cash flow generation performance in 2018,neg,train
So the expected cash contribution for this upcoming year is between $40 million and $50 million in total,neg,test
So we'll be taking a close look at that as well,neg,train
"We had a very good year in 2017, maybe not quite that good in 2018, it remains to be seen, but we're focused on that asset performance side",neg,train
"For the full-year 2018, we anticipate segment revenues to increase by high single-digit percentage versus 2017, including double-digit growth in commercial jet engine revenues and expected continued demand improvement in the oil and gas, and construction and mining markets",neg,train
And thank you all for the listeners who are joining us today,neg,train
That concludes our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 conference call,neg,train
I know you talked about NOLs extending for several years have no impact to lower taxes in the U,neg,train
"Due to our November 2017 common equity offering, I thought it would be worthwhile to briefly discuss ongoing share count assumptions and the impact of 2022 convertible notes on earnings per share calculations",neg,train
"Looking at our business by segments, we expect that the High Performance Materials & Components segment will continue to build on 2017s year-over-year growth trajectory in the first quarter of 2018, and throughout the year",neg,train
"We anticipate that the next-generation jet engine production ramps will continue to drive overall segment growth, aided by the ongoing expansion in several other key markets",neg,train
"Well I think the – obviously, the value today is much better than it's been over the last three or four years, right",neg,train
So we've had this question a lot on calls and meeting with investors,neg,train
"And we challenge and continue ask ourselves the question in terms of, is the share price being rewarded for the strategic actions being taken? And I think in fairness, I mean we need to continue to demonstrate the earnings growth profile in both segments, and do that and continue to reward the shareholder with the growth in share value",neg,train
"In the first quarter 2018, we anticipate our average share count to be approximately $125 million, an increase over the recent quarters due to the 17 million shares issued in our November 2017 follow-on common equity offering",neg,train
It sounds like you've done a lot to kind of reduce the exposure there,neg,train
"What else is out? I mean, a) could you give us a little color on what you think the 2019 cash contribution would be, assuming all your assumptions hold? And b) is there anything you can do to kind of reduce that liability that you haven't already done?",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 5, the High Performance Materials & Components segment continues to benefit from the ongoing next-generation jet engine production ramps by all of the engine OEMs",neg,train
"These production ramps result in both sales and margin growth for ATI, due to improved product mix, volume growth, and increased asset utilization",neg,train
We are still in the early phases of this industry-wide production expansion and we expect the benefits to ATI to continue in 2018 and through the end of the decade,neg,train
So we will – the primary emphasis in the last couple years has really been to change the fundamental focus of the business and Flat Rolled Products away from a more commodity driven focus into a higher value focus and at the same time significantly improve the cost structure and simplify that business by exiting products that really were not contributing and actually we’re taking away from the bottom line,neg,train
"First, ferrochrome prices have declined 15% from the fourth quarter 2017",neg,train
"Since ferrochrome prices are set quarterly, we can estimate the negative impact on the first quarter",neg,train
This business award was made possible by the world-class capabilities of our HRPF,neg,train
"In an effort to improve ATI’s financial leverage ratios, we fully redeemed $350 million, 9",neg,train
Using the vast majority of the proceeds received from the follow-on common equity offering made in November 2017,neg,train
This transaction will significantly reduce interest expense in 2018 and ensures we have no significant debt maturities until 2021,neg,train
"Operating margin growth significantly outpaced the revenue growth, primarily due to product mix benefits associated with a commercial jet engine production expansion and the benefits of higher production volumes across our asset base",neg,test
We achieved these results despite short-term financial headwinds in our titanium castings business,neg,train
Sales to the electronics market largely focused in Asia through our STAL joint venture also increased as a portion of our total revenue,neg,train
"Today, the STAL joint venture operates two facilities in the Shanghai, China area",neg,train
"We're nearing completion of STAL 3, which is expected to begin initial production in the second quarter of 2018 and ramp up during the second half of 2018 and first half of 2019",neg,train
We look forward to continuing the growth trajectory in this important business with this additional capacity,neg,train
We have replaced the defined benefit pension with a market competitive defined contribution retirement plan,neg,train
"The funded status of ATI pension plan continues to improve, increasing 6 percentage points at December 31, 2017 versus the prior year end as measured under generally accepted accounting standards",neg,train
"Consistent with our prior comments, ATI expects 2018 consolidated capital expenditures to be between $100 million and $125 million",neg,train
This includes the full amount of the expected $25 million capital expense required for the facility and equipment contemplated by the Next Gen Alloys joint venture of which GE will fund approximately 50%,neg,train
"And in the medical market, we are seeing heightened competition in products used for magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI machines",neg,train
Once again the power of the mix was evident in our results,neg,train
"In conjunction with a 9% revenue growth, segment operating profit increased 22% year-over-year, with sales of next-generation jet engine products up 26% compared to quarter four 2016",neg,train
Our 2017 financial results demonstrate the significant business improvement and cost reduction actions taken over the past few years,neg,train
Emphasize this point fourth quarter Flat Rolled Products segment operating profit was the best in five years,neg,train
"The full-year 2018 tax rate is expected to be between 5% and 10%, similar to 2017s rate",neg,test
federal and state income taxes for the next several years due to our net operating loss carryforward position,neg,test
We created the Next Gen Alloys JV with GE Aviation to further developing novel meltless titanium alloy powder manufacturing process,neg,train
This technology has the potential to meaningfully change the way the industry produces titanium powder materials,neg,train
"We are in the early phases of developing our Richburg, South Carolina site, to house this entity and we expect continued progress in 2018",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 4, many of the fourth quarter’s positive results were parts of trends seen throughout 2017, resulting from strategic actions taken over the past several years",neg,train
"Aerospace and defense growth continued to drive year-over-year revenue and operating profit increases in the High Performance Materials & Components segment, and the Flat Rolled Products segment benefited from its ongoing focus to increase high value product sales, improve overall product mix, and reduce the cost structure of the business",neg,train
Both segments tightly managed their costs and saw benefits from ongoing productivity improvement initiatives,neg,train
"And as far as capital deployment strategy, beyond the CapEx guidance that we gave and the pension contribution, we do not have plans to retire any debt in 2018",neg,train
"Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2018  8:30 AM ET",neg,train
"Rich, Pat after your comments about 2017 and balance sheet improvement, I just have to ask you about cash in 2018",neg,test
"You didn't issue a cash flow guide for this year, so I'm assuming you won't do that, but absolutely feel free to correct me if I'm wrong",neg,test

"So Rich, there's been a lot of speculation out there, especially within the specialty materials channel about hidden value and whether companies like ATI are getting the appropriate values on High Performance Material type of segments out there",neg,train
"I guess the question I had for you today is, how do you think about the portfolio going forward now that this FRP segment has better visibility, is there a way to potentially spin-off these assets or somehow unlock the value here?",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 13; in summary, 2017 was the year of solid progress for ATI, one that we can continue to build on in 2018 and beyond",neg,train
We made significant improvements in our year-over-year financial results in both segments and executed on our strategic priorities,neg,test
"So I think long winded answer to your question is that we believe during the first half, we'll see continued progress towards supporting end customer orders",neg,train
"And then once that happens, it's just a matter of scale up",neg,train
"As you know, we've said for a long time, whatever the level is, the level is going to be, we really don't have any control over that, the market forces",neg,train
"So our preference would be for more stability right, whatever the cost or price of nickel is",neg,train
"Just quickly, can you give us an update on the GE9X contract? Has happened decided yet, you still think that you could be position to win that as well? Thanks",neg,train
We anticipate first quarter 2018 demand in our Flat Rolled Products segment to continue to be relatively strong similar to the fourth quarter 2017 rates,neg,train
"Although, we do anticipate two non-recurring unfavorable items totaling about $10 million pre-tax to impact Flat Rolled Products segment financial results in the first quarter 2018",neg,train

And the next question comes from Chris Olin with Longbow Research,neg,train
So then that would – all of our operations would now be closed either hard freeze or soft freeze to the pension,neg,test
So those are the actions that we have planned and that's the level of contributions we expect,neg,train
So I think the last time we talked about several trials going on and there are multiple,neg,train
"What normally happens is they start with four slabs moved to 20 and then we move to 100, so that escalation is really driven by proven out the logistics, defining the physical properties, the strength of the end product, and then moving into supporting actual end customer orders",neg,train
"We actually have initial metal in the market and are getting very positive responses from our customers in terms of meeting their needs and the expectations from the quality perspective, which we anticipated, but it was great to have customer confirmation of that",neg,train
"Shifting to the Flat Rolled Products segment, we expect continued revenue and margin expansion for the full-year, but we expect some quarterly variability in earnings",neg,train
"Although, our strategic actions including the proposed Allegheny & Tsingshan Stainless joint venture have and will continue to reduce the impact of raw material volatility on the segment, significantly increasing or decreasing raw material input cost over short-time periods can still have a temporary impact on quarterly financial results",neg,train
"Managed working capital declined as a percentage of sales, continuing the positive year-over-year trends throughout 2017",neg,train
"Aligned with the company full-year guidance, ATI had capital expenditures of $123 million in 2017, including $37 million in the fourth quarter",neg,train
This compares $202 million in 2016 and marks and end to the significant capital expenditure cycle to build out ATI's asset base needed to meet the anticipated jet engine production ramp and the completion of our HRPF,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"The Flat Rolled Products segment achieved its strongest quarter in five years, with segment operating profit at 5",neg,train
The Flat Rolled Products segment benefited from improving conditions in several markets and increase in raw material based surcharges compared to the third quarter and continued improvement in the businesses costs structure,neg,train
John Sims and Bob Wetherbee will provide more detail on their respective segments later in this call,neg,train
"Hi, Timna, I think that we’re aware obviously because we buy a lot of nickel",neg,train
We are a nickel alloy company and we’re a stainless company that consumes nickel,neg,train
"And finally, we expect sales of Precision and Engineered Strip products to continue to build on 2017s nearly 20% year-over-year growth with initial gains from the STAL capacity expansion expected in the second half of 2018",neg,train
"In summary, the High Performance Materials & Components segment performed well in 2017 and we look forward to being a continued growth engine for ATI in 2018 and beyond",neg,train
"We don't disclose the total amount of the NOLs that are outstanding, but we're covered through the end of the decade, basically, at what we believe our projections to be at",neg,train
And look at the footnote in the disclosure in the 10-K,neg,train
"27 per share in the fourth quarter 2017, our best quarterly results since mid-2012",neg,train
Underlying this performance was ATI revenue growth of 14% versus the prior year’s fourth quarter and solid operational results in both segments,neg,train
Full-year 2018 operating margins are anticipated increase between 100 basis points and 300 basis points over 2017 significantly improved margin levels including the negative year-over-year results expected in the first quarter 2018,neg,train
These efforts combined to produce a significant improvement in earnings per share moving from a prior year loss to making nearly $0,neg,train
Some of the actions taken were continuation of ongoing initiatives and some were new ideas executed in a timely manner,neg,train
All were clearly aimed at removing balance sheet risk and reducing financial leverage,neg,train
And we continue to develop our advance powder capabilities with the completion of our new nickel-based powder alloy facility in North Carolina and the announced investment in a new titanium powder facility to be located on the same site,neg,train
"All references to net income, net loss, or earnings in this conference call, are mean net income, net loss or earnings attributable to ATI",neg,test
"If you've connected to this call via the Internet, you should see slides on your screen",neg,train
"For those who have dialed in, slides are available on our website, atimetals",neg,test
"Has anything changed with the new 2018 guidance? And then maybe can you help us with the buildup of the various verticals since the anticipated, I believe, $3 billion in sales? How much is aerospace, defense, energy, industrial, et cetera maybe rough estimates?",neg,train
"And as evidence of that, I mean, the first quarter of 2018, some of the guidance we gave were being hit on the other side of that because in a short-term period we had a significant downward fluctuation in chrome that is going to negatively impact the first quarter of 2018 with out-of-phase surcharges",neg,train
So when I say we would prefer stability in a perfect world that's because there you're not impacted by these out-of-phase surcharge issues,neg,train
"I think on some of the smaller turbines, you're seeing healthy growth in demand and healthy coating activity now",neg,train
And I think when we're working with those OEMs and we look at the opportunities for R&D and development of unique alloys that create value in those particular applications,neg,train
"I think that between now and 2020, 2021 you're going to see a return to a more normalized demand on the gas turbine side",neg,train
"This expansion is expected to continue with 2018 production of between 1,150 and 1,200 LEAP engines",neg,train
"Airframe growth rates remain strong, but well below jet engine growth rates",neg,train
"As a reminder, the airframe business is largely based on contractual demand requirements set forth in multi-year contracts",neg,train
"Product form mix can vary from quarter-to-quarter, resulting in some volatility in revenue and margins on a quarterly basis",neg,train
"Full-year 2018 segment operating margins are expected to continue to expand, increasing by approximately 200 basis points versus the full-year 2017",neg,test
We anticipate that ongoing growth in next-generation products sales to the jet engine market and the associated benefits from increased asset utilization will drive these improving margins,neg,train
Segment operating profit in the High Performance Materials & Components segment reached 12,neg,train
"7% of sales, representing 140 basis point improvement versus the prior year",neg,train
"This continues the improvement trend experienced throughout 2017, largely driven by the benefits from the ongoing jet engine production ramp at several of our large customers",neg,train
We believe that 2017 was a strong representation of the business that we have built over the past several years and indicative of its growth potential moving forward,neg,test
"Today, we are focused on execution, meeting our commitments in existing long-term agreements and effectively and profitably supporting our customers’ growth plans",neg,train
This includes a significant year-over-year improvement in our titanium castings business for 2018,neg,train
We are on track for this business to be near breakeven in 2018 and return to profitability in 2019,neg,train
So we're not going to specifically disclose the impact of the nickel change and it's really because of the quarterly fluctuations,neg,train
"There were some impacts on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but it's more about the moves in a short timeframe",neg,train
"So there was some gradual movement in the back half of the year, but we did have some pretty aggressive moves up and down during the course of the year",neg,train
So we're not going to be specific with respect to the impact on 2018,neg,train
"Additionally, we expect to benefit from improving performance in our titanium castings business and reduce start-up expense for our new nickel alloy powder operation located in North Carolina",neg,train
"Similar to 2017, the rate of improvement in operating margins will likely vary by quarter based on timing of underlying customer demand and other factors",neg,train
"Finally, we expect a modest manage working capital increase in 2018 to fund our growth in both operating segments",neg,train
We anticipate the managed working capital growth will be greater in the first half of the year as we support the Allegheny & Tsingshan Stainless joint venture startup,neg,train
"Taking a deeper look at fourth quarter, you can see that segment revenues increased 9% overall versus 2016, including an 11% increase in aerospace and defense market sales, which represents 76% of total segment sales",neg,train
"Taking a deeper dive into the aerospace and defense markets, year-over-year growth continued in all three submarkets; jet engine growth as discussed earlier grew a double-digit percentage for both the fourth quarter and the full-year, underlying this growth were significant production rate ramps at many of our jet engine related customers",neg,train
"As an example, GE Aviation cited in a recent investor presentation that they and their partner SAE will produce 473 LEAP engines in 2017, marking a substantial increase versus 2016",neg,train
"After our prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions",neg,test
"During the question-and-answer session, please limit yourself to two questions to allow time for others on the line",neg,test
"As always, we will make every attempt to reach everyone in the question-and-answer queue within the allotted conference call time",neg,train
"On the aerospace, again, we shouldn't ignore defense for High Performance",neg,train
I think we're pretty close to troughing at the bottom there,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global,neg,train
I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about where you are in those partnership discussions with the two perspective folks at Flat Rolled,neg,train
"I know you mentioned you're still doing some qualification testing, but just what are you anticipating and timing what sort of milestones are still out there that we should be following?",neg,train
"In addition, to these specific actions we have also taken steps to substantially limit future liability growth in the ATI pension plan",neg,train
These actions include hard freezes meaning no additional benefits for future service and soft freezes or closures to new entrants at nearly all of ATI’s U,neg,train
This is Flat Rolled Products’ first long-term agreement with this global customer and as a result of ATI's renewed strategic focus on the defense market,neg,train
"The joint venture will import stainless slabs from Tsingshan’s facilities in Indonesia, which bypassed steps in the traditional slab production process, significantly reducing raw material costs volatility, as Tsingshan is backward integrated and the key raw materials used to produce stainless steels",neg,train
"But in the great scheme of things, our strategy is really to try everything we can to mitigate that impact of the volatility in terms of how we buy, how we produce, how we turn our inventories",neg,train
"And the better we are at that the more – and the joint venture with Tsingshan is really a very important component of that because for the first time ever on the stainless side, which is really the largest volume of nickel units that we buy",neg,train
"We have the ability to be less volatile on those particular commodity products than ever before, so",neg,train
"Based on today's assumptions, but that's given the today's anticipated rates when you look at the interest rate environment as well",neg,train
"So there's upward bias there that could impact that a little bit as well, but that's what we're looking at for 2019 based on today's rate environment",neg,train
I know some people were surprised by the share issuance in the quarter and you talked again about wanting to achieve investment grade,neg,train
Do you think you need to issue any more shares? Do you think given your current forecast that will not be necessary?,neg,train
"Fourth quarter operating and margins improved by 140 basis points versus fourth quarter 2016, marking the sixth consecutive quarter with an improvement of that magnitude or higher",neg,train
The full year’s financial trends were consistent with those seen in fourth quarter,neg,train
"Revenues increased 7% versus the full-year 2016 driven by commercial jet engine growth of 11% and double-digit increases in the defense, oil and gas, and construction, and mining markets",neg,train
This robust growth was tempered by declines in electrical energy and medical markets,neg,train
Good morning and welcome to the Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Results Conference Call,neg,test
"[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions",neg,train
"Robert Wetherbee - Executive Vice President, ATI Flat Rolled Products Group",neg,train
We had the benefit in the early part of 2017 in a favorable side of chrome and then we had the real negative impact in Q3,neg,train
I think Q4 was more normalized and I would not attribute a lot of the Q4 performance to favorable benefits on the raw material cost side,neg,train
"In conjunction with the revenue growth, our profitability continued to improve",neg,train
The benefits of higher volumes ongoing product mix improvements in both segments and our relentless focus on costs help ATI to achieve total segment operating profit margins of more than 8% compared to essentially breakeven results in the prior year,neg,train
"Gautam, I also think we're seeing I mean if you look at the progress over the last six months in terms of the level of qualification work being done on a pure volume basis it is increasing dramatically",neg,train
"So we think it's still real and it will generate a long-term not just in 2018, but a long-term opportunity for ATI",neg,train
I just wanted to follow up on the expenses really quick,neg,train
"In prior years, the March quarter, you tend to have an 8% increase in expenses",neg,train
"And so I just want to confirm, is that a fair rate of change you'd be thinking about for the quarter that we're in now?",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mewhirter from SunTrust,neg,train
"No, I think there's a lot of reasons for investors to be optimistic, and we're certainly seeing them at very high levels of optimism",neg,train
We are very pleased with the results from our first quarter,neg,train
"This was, as you recall, our first full quarter with Scottrade results, following the September acquisition",neg,train
We made a great deal of progress in preparation for our upcoming client or clearing conversion,neg,train
Big wins included standing up a service center in St,neg,train
"Louis, redirecting Scottrade's online account openings to TD Ameritrade, and introducing some enhancements on the TD Ameritrade side that will help smooth the transition for Scottrade clients",neg,train
I don't know if you can size it up how you mentioned on January like the level of trading activity for the crypto and the cannabis just in terms of how big Asia is,neg,train
"Our new rate sensitivity for the next 25 basis point increase is $60 million to $110 million in pretax income, which implies deposit betas of 15% to 25%",neg,train
"Fee-based revenue continues to grow nicely, including growth in our advice solutions",neg,test
"Advised assets ended the quarter in excess of $62 billion, including Essential Portfolios at $1",neg,train
And our job is to be able to scale up that operation to service them well,neg,train
"We're not talking hundreds of millions here, we're talking about tens of millions",neg,train
And my expectation by year-end is that we will still come in towards the high end of our non-GAAP expense growth range for the year,neg,train
You've seen some of the launches we've just sum up this last quarter,neg,train
"Order routing revenue was $98 million in the quarter, driven by high trading volumes",neg,train
Asset-based revenue of $790 million was 63% of net revenues,neg,train
"Bank deposit account or BDA balances, were relatively flat versus the end of last quarter, as new money was offset by heavy client net buying, which was up with client participation in the market",neg,train
Our BDA net yield declined slightly sequentially following our first full quarter of Scottrade,neg,test
"Our BDA float versus fixed split at the end of the quarter was 24-76, which included approximately $4 billion of excess float that we plan to extend over the next few months",neg,train
"The convergence of the platforms, from my point of view, it hasn't really started yet",neg,train
But I think you will start to see that happening over the next sort of while,neg,train
"Our institutional channel continues to thrive, again contributing approximately 80% of the net new assets in the quarter",neg,test
"Growth was quite diverse coming from existing advisers, new RIA relationships, as well as breakaway brokers",neg,train
"We launched institutional digital self-service, which makes it easier for associates to research adviser questions, enhancing the efficiency, consistency and accuracy of information given to advisers",neg,train
"One trend that was more pronounced at the end of the quarter and has continued in recent weeks is increased interest in cannabis and blockchain-related securities, as well as cryptocurrencies in general",neg,train
This doesn't surprise us given the significant media coverage on these topics,neg,train
Bitcoin and blockchain-related stocks have been more frequently among our clients' top traded stocks since November,neg,train
And we are among the first to make the CBOE bitcoin futures products available for trading for qualified retail clients,neg,train
"We have been monitoring the market closely, facing in access over time as it matures, to help both our clients and the firm manage risk",neg,train
"You mentioned with the Fed, I think you moved the margin rates",neg,train
"I'm just -- what we should expect there relative maybe the competitive landscape? And then I know like the stock, lending the gap part was active in the quarter",neg,train
"But just any color just because that line item tends to be a little bit more volatile and just given the price moves, what do you expect?",neg,train
"It's this growth on the other side of the globe, combined with the increasing mobility of today's investors, that inspired a brand-new offering I am excited to share with you today",neg,train
And then just back to the expenses and the tax benefits,neg,train
"So it sounded like from your comments, the range that you have for total operating expenses in your outlook to $3 point -- a little over $3",neg,train
3 billion at the high end is more due to the level of activity in the customer engagement than it is to giving back and you are -- or reinvesting any of the tax reform benefits,neg,train
Just wanted to make sure that I have that right,neg,train
"So on the OpEx spend side, nothing further to answer, Rich, than my last answer",neg,train
"On the capital deployment side, again, post-integration, Steve and I will be sitting down with the board and taking a look at what it is that we're earning on a consistent run rate and make some capital deployment decisions",neg,train
And so that's what I'd say on that particular topic,neg,train
"On the competitive front, if you're sort of suddenly asking whether the tax change changes that, look, this has been a competitive industry, it always is",neg,train
"We've seen, for example, betas still remaining low in line with our expectations, and we expect that to continue",neg,train
"But all in, we're feeling pretty good about the outlook for the year",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America,neg,train
"You're on Facebook Messenger, Amazon Alexa, I just realized it's still early days for those initiatives",neg,train
But can you just talk to your overall distribution strategy? How do you see that evolving over the next 3 to 5 years? And what's the roll of these large platform companies that have large customer bases,neg,train
Do you see this as a way to acquire new clients? Or is it servicing your existing customer base do their pipes?,neg,train
"And first of all, the margin requirements on many of these are first higher and in many cases, there is no margining because they're OTC stocks to start with, it's the first point",neg,train
"Second point is, I just want to put it in perspective to the overall uplift in trade",neg,train
"So for example, we've said in January to date, our trading levels are literally near 1 million",neg,train
"If you zeroed out all of the cannabis and the blockchain-related symbols, you'd still have a number that's just shy of 900,000 in trading",neg,train
"So it really goes to show a number of broad-based retail engagement, people trying to refigure out post the tax changes how to rebalance their portfolio, ever-increasing highs in the marketplace",neg,train
"I just wanted to expand, I guess, on Michael's comment",neg,train
Or are we just reading too much into it at this point?,neg,train
Just wanted to ask a quick one here on deposit beta,neg,train
"Can you break down, number one, I guess, overall the client asset breakdown at this point, given the strong growth in your institutional business",neg,train
"But sort of small picture question, a big picture question",neg,train
"The small picture question is, the average, if revenue per trade or the mix or the mix versus stocks versus derivatives, how does that compare to the U",neg,train
"The year has just begun, but it's a great way to start",neg,train
"As always, we have a lot of work left to do, but momentum remains in our favor",neg,train
Nearly half of our advisers have used some aspect of this functionality since launch,neg,train
We have much to talk about when we welcome nearly 2000 advisers to our annual National LINC conference next week in Orlando,neg,train
"Elsewhere on the revenue front, we're seeing good adoption of our digital guidance offering",neg,train
"We're also seeing strong adoption of our enhanced ETF Market Center, as balances have grown approximately $8 billion since its relaunch in October",neg,train
We received regulatory approval in September and are thrilled to be open for business,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies,neg,train
"But just given the very low levels of client cash allocations and then you also have the high DARTs and retail engagement, do you have any thoughts on the broader implications for the U",neg,train
"economic cycle? And I'm just wondering when is the last time, historically, we saw this dynamic?",neg,train
"I know it's pretty nascent, there's only several securities on there",neg,train
"But do you guys really expect this to increase engagement in the total number of trades put through? Or is it just a bit more of kind of a convenience form factor for clients that are kind already placing trades, and now they just don't have to wait for the opening to do it?",neg,train
"I guess, can you give us a sense of what synergies have been realized thus far? And I know that you've talked about just the direction of expenses higher than lower",neg,train
"But given all the moving parts, I guess, any more finer point around that would be helpful",neg,train
"And they're -- what they are looking for, as I said earlier, is content",neg,train
"But by the same token, it's small today, and so it won't really move the needle in the short term",neg,train
"And a quick follow-up would be, I think you've laid out a pretty clear path on the cost synergy side",neg,test
"But now that you have Scottrade and looking on the revenue synergy side, is the cross-selling underway? Is there anything that you're doing to make headway? And I know the targets for cross-selling are farther out",neg,train
"But in regards to taking up the derivative percentage or payment for order flow or client wallet side of Scottrade, the revenue synergy side?",neg,train
"Margin revenue was $191 million in the quarter, with an average balance of $17",neg,train
We increased pricing on the negotiated book on December 19,neg,train
"Following the most recent Fed move, and we increased the rack rate book on January 1",neg,train
"So in terms of the margin, we've been pretty consistently been moving our negotiated book up with each increase",neg,test
"As we think about the non-negotiated book, we're really looking at what the competitors are doing",neg,train
We've been able to make that move the last couple of times,neg,test
So we feel pretty good about where the margin book is headed competitively,neg,train
"In terms of stock owned, I agree exactly with what you said",neg,train
"We saw a big uptick in December, which traded a good quarter",neg,train
"So hopefully, that will continue into next year and has a big impact on the net interest revenue",neg,test
"And so as a result, it hasn't really attributed much to the DARTs to date, even in these last few weeks since the launch",neg,train
"So back to the point of making sure with that risk controls, margin rates and making sure there's good education levels that help our clients be safe as they trade these new interesting asset classes",neg,train
I guess this is closely related to the last question,neg,train
"But you talked about the significant benefits you're going to receive from tax reform, and you're looking at different ways that you could put this incremental income to use",neg,train
"So I guess trying to distinguish that, I know there's a high level of client engagement, but what would you do with the tax reform? And you said you're going to look at your capital deployment strategy",neg,train
"And will you do anything with tax reform that would impact your margins, I guess, is the question, your pretax margins?",neg,train
"We see financial strength continuing across all core metrics, starting with a record $1",neg,train
Client engagement was up significantly across both the legacy TD Ameritrade and Scottrade client basis,neg,train
"Client logins, accounts trading and DARTs all posted healthy increases, and retail clients were net buyers of $6",neg,train
"This resulted in very strong trading, 726,000 trades per day on average, which is up 49% from a year ago",neg,train
"Steve, just wanted to get your updated thoughts around resuming the buyback if the clearing conversion can happen this quarter? And any way to help us think about the magnitude once the buyback does resume?",neg,train
Now we're very proud of our best execution policies and practices,neg,train
"And this has been an issue for the industry for many, many, many years",neg,train
And so we welcome their review and we expect to do very well,neg,train
"3 billion in BDA balances matures monthly, where the rate earned on extension is expected to continue to match or exceed maturities",neg,train
"When it comes to deposit betas, we increased our pay rates on December 29, the blended deposits of beta is 16% or 4 basis points",neg,train
"In fact, activity in January had been even stronger, with 975,000 trades per day on average through the '17",neg,test
"5 billion in net new client assets, or a 9% annualized growth rate, a great result up a much higher base",neg,train
"New business on the retail side is doing well, with record levels of new accounts",neg,train
"We're seeing an increase in new business across all age groups, but growth among investors under 35 is up considerably, up 72% from last year",neg,train
"Well, I'm pausing here to say, well, if you're asking this low level of client cash we've never seen",neg,train
"And so they take advantage of that, but also it's just a numerator-denominator thing",neg,train
"If you are asking whether markets are at a high end of the cycle, it certainly feels like this bull market is long in the tooth, but by the same token, it doesn't seem to be a catalyst for change, and there seems to be a drifting up with low VIX",neg,train
So you can really add any other commentary that these market condition -- set of conditions has on that,neg,train
"And so yes, as we've announced, we've just launched our free trading platform",neg,train
"Frankly, I believe that we've got a -- sorry, free education platform, sorry, slipped there",neg,train
"We've had the best education on the Street for many years now, but frankly, it has been in our Investools platform for a smaller subset of clients",neg,train
"So we've exposed that now to, and updated it for a more broad-based offering",neg,test
"In a month or 2, it's literally gone up 30%",neg,train
"All of these things are trying to help our clients who are new to investing or trading, get educated on the potential risks and how to best maximize them",neg,test
"On the blockchain and cannabis-related security trading that's happening, I mean, no question that seems to be the theme of the, certainly, the tail end of the quarter",neg,train
No projections yet so as to what the absolute percentage size is,neg,train
"As I've said multiple times, it will have a much higher growth rate, I'm expecting, than our existing American business",neg,train
And we're looking forward to what it can do for our overall growth rate,neg,train
"But to be an outsized portion of our overall revenues in the short term would be, first of all, a problem to have",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities,neg,test
"I think when you look at the synergies that we're seeing early on is just, and some of the administrative areas you're having, folks that are able to leave early, et cetera, et cetera",neg,train
"But for the most part, the major synergies, the back-office staffing, the branch staffing, the closing of branches are all going to happen post-clearing conversion",neg,train
So you see those towards the second half of the year,neg,train
"Institutional betas, we would expect would be higher than retail betas over time",neg,train
"We have seen them be pretty rational to date, so far, but we would expect them as rates get higher to be higher",neg,train
And that in both of our businesses we're seeing historically low levels of cash to assets under management,neg,train
"Frankly, I think a few years from now, we'll all look back and say, wasn't it obvious the 24-hour trading was coming to these capital markets, because it's in every other market we seem to have these days",neg,test
And so that's how we've set it up so far and what we think others will enter,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"And with that, I'll pause and let the operator open up the call for Q&A",neg,test
And maybe just a follow-up to Brennan's earlier question on differences in retail versus institutional,neg,train
"I just wanted to get a better understanding about the operating margin or profitability profile for those two segments, just given the flows are so much stronger on the institutional side, how the operating margins actually compare their versus the retail segment?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell with Barclays,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW,neg,train
So first part of it comes from the tax windfall that everybody is wondering if and when we're going to spend that,neg,train
"Second quarter, you're going to see our what is the normal Q2 over Q1 sequential expense bump that we always get",neg,train
"And given that, that's just post the integration, there's going to be some additional noise in there",neg,train
"So post the actual Scottrade integration, when we've got some cycles back for all the people that are working hard on that, we've always got a list of next-to-fund-type projects that may or may not have been in our original plan based on lower revenue growth",neg,train
"While we're looking ahead as well, considering the role we play in driving transformational change across this industry",neg,train
"For the last 12 to 18 months, we've been laying the groundwork to make these efforts possible",neg,train
"And now that we're here, on the verge of integrating Scottrade and starting to see the operational impact of our many investments, it's a very exciting time to be at TD Ameritrade",neg,train
"TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (NASDAQ:AMTD) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2018  8:30 AM ET",neg,train
"Tim, as you think about, first of all, year-to-date trends",neg,train
I'm just trying to gauge to what extent they may have tapered off from the first couple of weeks in terms of the portfolio rebalancing,neg,test
But as you think about the organic growth initiatives that you have between the 24-hour marketplace and the Hong Kong and Singapore,neg,train
"And then also the long-term synergies from cross-selling more trading services, including options to Scottrade clients",neg,train
"Do you think that would be, even from the highly sort of strong level of DARTs that we're seeing year-to-date, do you think that's something that can potentially keep this level of trading activity up at these levels?",neg,train
"And now, I'd like to turn the call over to TD Ameritrade President and CEO, Tim Hockey",neg,train
"Tim, you put out the 2018 regulatory priorities a couple of weeks ago, and there was a section there focused on best ex",neg,train
And it seems like they are going to review how brokers manage their conflicts of interest in executing client orders,neg,train
And also expanding their surveillance program for best ex in 2018,neg,test
And I know Ameritrade has internal controls to decide which wholesalers to use and where to route orders,neg,train
But just wondering if you could comment on whether the increased surveillance from FINRA or the examination report they published in December would alter any of the internal surveillance being done in Ameritrade or potentially routing decisions?,neg,train
"So four words around our overall distribution strategy, high tech, right touch",neg,train
"Your question about networks, whether it'd be here or whether it'd be in Asia, is a great one",neg,test
We think there is a great opportunity to partner with the right players because we have something that their clients will want,neg,test
"And they, of course, have distribution that we would want access to",neg,train
"We see this as a net benefit to our clients, particularly those in Asia, who will, for the first time, have the flexibility of trading during their own daytime hours",neg,train
Throughput remains very strong with the number of technology deliverables more than double what we delivered a year ago,neg,train
We have recast our original fiscal 2018 guidance to reflect just the impact of these new tax rates,neg,train
45 and the related non-GAAP diluted EPS range is now $2,neg,train
"Finally, regarding capital deployment, we paid $119 million in dividends in the quarter or 26% of non-GAAP net income",neg,train
"We realized that we stand to incur significant benefits as a result of our adjusted tax rates, and there are many ways in which we can put this incremental income to good use",neg,train
"We plan to look at each of them, as well as our broader capital deployment strategy in greater detail once we have successfully completed the Scottrade clearing conversion and substantially realized synergies",neg,train
"So Tim, wanted to ask a question regarding your strategy for new investors",neg,train
"And I'm just wondering, given the significant volatility in those markets, whether you could speak to your efforts to help those investors manage risks, and you spoke of some of your educational efforts and some of the free offerings you provided whether those efforts are actually helping those investors diversify into other products, helping limited portfolio concentration risk",neg,train
"I guess, there just seems to be a lot of sensitivity around some of those key themes, especially given the growing interest in some of those stocks",neg,train
"We're seeing positive trends with respect to client retention, and we like the progress we're seeing on achieving synergy targets",neg,train
"We have all hands on deck to deliver a positive experience, both operationally for our clients and culturally for our associates",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Conor Fitzgerald with Goldman Sachs,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Goeser, Director of Investor Relations",neg,train

"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation's December Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call",neg,train
"While cash levels are up slightly sequentially to approximately $150 billion, cash as a percentage of total client assets remained at historic lows at 12",neg,test
"7%, down slightly from last quarter due to the growth in the value of investment and as a result of strong net buying from our retail clients",neg,train
"Stock lending was a strong $53 million in the quarter, as short interest increased",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Crédit Suisse,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Mac Sykes with Gabelli,neg,train
"With respect to synergies, we still expect to realize $175 million to $225 million this fiscal year",neg,train
"While we started to realize synergies this quarter related to advertising and some administrative functions, we expect to realize the majority of the synergies following the clearing conversion",neg,train
"As we look to next quarter, certain expenses will increase due to incremental investments in advertising incentives and client service personnel to address the high levels of client engagement",neg,train
"However, expenses are expected to decline in the last 2 quarters of the year as a result of the clearing conversion",neg,train
"So first of all, again, if you really want to micro-analyze what's happening, even since the end of the quarter, for example, we've seen a slight curtailing in cryptos as being a percentage of our trades just in the first couple of weeks versus December",neg,train
And that feels about right if you think about the news articles we're all seeing around cryptos,neg,train
"Once the number starts to come down a little bit, it became less and less frothy",neg,train
"As I said, having said that, those 2 categories really are only contributing high single digits in our current level versus the 9",neg,train
But I don't think anybody really expects this level to continue unabated for the rest of the year,neg,train
"The other factors that you talked about 24/5 trading, Asia, these are literally dripping wet launches from our point of view, and so they won't be significant contributors",neg,train
"But our overall theme is to bring investing and trading closer to where our clients are, whether it'd be our Facebook Messenger app",neg,train
"But the last quarter, you'd spoken about 4% to 8% I think core expense growth rate",neg,train
And so the revenue backdrop seems like its developing favorably,neg,train
And so just trying to think about whether that's still the right range,neg,train
I get some of the comments that you're looking at kind of increasing some investments into the business,neg,test
"So I'm just trying to think about what are the areas that the investments are going to be in? And then how should we think about that, yes, I guess, expense growth rate range, especially now that you have the benefit from tax reform as well?",neg,train
These are all innovations that our clients are using and starting to put into our daily -- into their daily lives,neg,train
"And so as a result, we want to bring our capabilities to bear to where they are already are",neg,train
"Those will have incremental effects on our business volumes over time, but it won't be any one thing anytime soon",neg,train
"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call",neg,train
"You can find everything related to this morning's announcement on our corporate website, amtd",neg,train
"com, including our press release, the prepared remarks for today's call, an updated fiscal 2018 outlook statement and a new financial factsheet with supplemental information",neg,train
And so we have a very heavily driven market in general,neg,test
"And then with Scottrade coming on the first full quarter of Scottrade, they have a heavier equity mix than TD Ameritrade legacy did historically",neg,train
So I think we're not changing or giving specific guidance on the BDA,neg,train
But I would expect it to be towards the high end,neg,train
It really depends on the beta and what we see for additional rate moves,neg,test
TD Ameritrade exists to transform lives and investing for the better,neg,train
"Whether it's something more short-term, like delivering on the Scottrade integration or something bigger and all encompassing, like competing on the client experience, everything we do ultimately ladders back up to that one thing, transformation",neg,train
"It's this purpose that acknowledges the history of disruption and innovation that lies within our DNA, as well as the passion we have to continually up our game",neg,train
"So as you know, we've had our Singapore office for a number of years now, I think 5 or 6",neg,train
"It's been growing very nicely, but again, a very small base",neg,train
"Hong Kong was important to us, because it really is",neg,train
"First of all, it's the largest offshore capital in terms of market in the world, and it is the gateway to Mainland China",neg,train
"And given our license there does give us the opportunity to actually open accounts for the mainland Chinese, without having to get any additional licensing",neg,train
"It is a -- it's going to have a high, high growth rate, but it's off a very small base",neg,train
"So again, a relatively small spend, high, high growth rate, but by the same token off a relatively small base",neg,train
"All of that, we're still seeing 3 quarters out by the end of the year, notwithstanding a spike in the second quarter, that we will be inside but very much towards the high end of the non-GAAP expense range",neg,train
That's sort of the -- to drive back at all that,neg,train
"Second part of your question, in terms of an acquisition, the tax break are not -- really doesn't have any bearing on our thinking in terms of M&A activity",neg,train
"So first of all, the price points are similar to our American price points, but compared to the local competitors, who often have both the fee and the basis points charge, it's a great deal",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
TD Ameritrade and Scottrade are two companies with equally proud legacies of changing lives through investing,neg,train
"And as we came together through this integration, we really wanted to get down to that one thing that unites us, something that recognizes the work we've done and inspires the work we have yet to do",neg,train
"The short-term answer is, as you say on the institutional side, as it continues to be huge growth story",neg,train
"And it's, I think, amplified by what is a fantastic client service orientation and great technology on our institutional platform and it's been a winning formula for us",neg,test
"Generally, our breakaway brokers tend to come from the independent broker-dealer space, a, to start; and b, what we've heard from our clients and prospective clients is that they are reassessing in light of this particular change, but it doesn't necessarily change their long-term direction",neg,train
There's not many RIAs that go back to the broker-dealer space,neg,train
I think we've only ever had one client that's ever done it in our entire history,neg,train
We would characterize it as maybe a speed bump as those that are considering breaking away are taking a look at the implications,neg,train
"But other than that, the pipeline is still very full and conversations are continuing",neg,train

Nearly 70% of the clients who use our research and education resources do so outside of regular trading hours,neg,test
It's a gap in the client experience that we can fill,neg,train
Our first question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair,neg,train
We had a strong quarter with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0,neg,train
"80, driven primarily by strong revenue and favorable tax items",neg,train
The Scottrade acquisition was the primary driver of free tax changes relative to prior periods,neg,train
So we will focus on items that may have differed from expectations or our trends in the business in general,neg,train
"Transaction revenue exceeded expectations as a result of continued high trading volumes, despite relatively low volatility",neg,train
Commission rates were near the low end of our fiscal 2018 guidance range at $7,neg,train
"Mobile represented 22% of total trades and derivatives were 33%, including 26% in options, 6% in futures and 1% in forex",neg,train
"I guess the way to think about it, Rich, is that we always anticipated the revenues to start flowing some time after clearing conversion",neg,train
"It's a little earlier perhaps than we originally anticipated, so that means that brings forward all that revenue stream at about the same pace we originally anticipated",neg,train
"Right now, I can tell you as we're getting ready, we still feel quite confident about the type of clients, the quality of clients, the branches are going through, obviously, significant training to get ready to absorb the additional clients on to our base",neg,train
"So no reason to believe that there is any degradation, of course, to our original revenue projections or the same time frame",neg,train
We continue to be optimistic and maybe just pull forward 6 months based on the timing of the conversion,neg,train
"So first, on the commission rate in the quarter, just maybe, Steve, talk about the factors that drove the commission rate to the lower end",neg,test
"Obviously, it was way more than offset by strong trading activity",neg,test
But I just -- what drove that? And how confident are you that you'll be in that $7,neg,train
"We actually think what we have to offer is, if it's right in with the opportunity in China, especially in Mainland China, the first thing is that they are very interested in getting access to U",neg,test
"And I'd say most importantly, they are starved for education",neg,test
"Can you talk about the backlog there? And then I guess just longer term, any -- your views on the change in the broker protocol? And kind of how that may or may not impact flows or demand going forward?",neg,test
I just wanted to circle back on the Asia strategy,neg,train
"Just if you could talk about any sort of goals that you have for the international business over the next 3 to 5 years? And if you could talk about your strategy for Mainland China, what sort of investments going to be required to make this more meaningful contribution over time?",neg,train
"Below operating expenses, we incurred $13 million of other expenses, primarily due to the sale of corporate treasuries that are realized loss",neg,train
"Reinvestment yields are higher than the yields of the securities sold, so we expect there will be incremental benefits over time",neg,train
"With the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and decline in the federal corporate tax rate, we are required to use a blended rate pushback to the beginning of the fiscal year",neg,test
"The blending results and the rate of 27% for each quarter of our 2018 fiscal year, including the December quarter",neg,train
"However, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was even lower at 2%, as we realized approximately $78 million of discreet after-tax benefits or $0",neg,train
"14 earnings per diluted share impact, primarily due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities",neg,train
The remainder of the tax benefit in the quarter was due to the movement of our effective rate to 27%,neg,train
We are expecting a full year 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 22% as a result of 2% in the December quarter and 27% in the remaining 3 quarters,neg,train

"We have a large number of covering analysts, so for those of you planning to participate in the Q&A, we ask that you limit your questions to 1 or 2, so that we can get to as many of you as possible",neg,train
"And my last part of the question, which is a bigger-picture question is, do you have any kind of idea now, I know it's very, very early, of how big Asia could be as a percentage of your total business? I mean, could it be as big as 25% of your global DARTs or global AUM? Or would there actually be regulatory restrictions, or even sort of business strategy restrictions where you want to put some for the governor? Or is the market not that visible to get to be that big, that part of your global business?",neg,train
"A significant portion of new clients have indicated they are new to investing, which reinforces the importance of quality investor education",neg,train
"Late last year, we made the decision to take our premium education services, previously offered through Investools, and built them into our broader, more comprehensive education offering",neg,train
"Since our soft launch in October, usage has increased 30%",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS,neg,train
"Yes, so we don't break out separately the retail versus institutional profitability",neg,train
"Historically, I think in the industry, retail has a higher return on client assets on a higher revenue base, but both businesses have a strong operating margin",neg,train
"And we expect probably at some point in the future, yes, that we will disclose those numbers, but we don't do that currently",neg,train
"We also continued to stand up more agile teams, on our way to hitting our target of 80% agile by the end of the year",neg,train
"We added to the capabilities of our Amazon Alexa skill, which now includes access to market information and investor education, as well as a visual experience for Echo Show devices",neg,train
And I'm really thinking about the Cboe bitcoin futures product,neg,train
"There's a lot of volatility there, and there's a lot of retail investors that are probably looking and engaging this product",neg,train
"We incurred $179 million in acquisition-related costs comprised mainly of $81 million recorded in employment, $8 million recorded in professional services and $85 million recorded at other operating expenses, which was primarily related to contract terminations",neg,test
"From our point of view, we've seen, for example, many of the market moving events happening outside of regular trading hours",neg,train
"And so, whether it be the Brexit or whether it be the U",neg,train
"election, or even as recently, last weekend, as the government shutdown",neg,train
"The trading so far, literally, it's only been a couple of days, but trading so far has been fairly, fairly tight in terms of range, quite liquid",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Nomura Instinet,neg,train
I know you've all experienced a slight change in our IR process,neg,train
"So I just want to call out our Investor Relations team and Jeff Goeser in particular, an award-winning Investor Relations person, by the way",neg,train
And so we look forward to talking to you again in the second quarter,neg,train
"With us today from the company is President and Chief Executive Officer, Tim Hockey; and Chief Financial Officer, Steve Boyle",neg,train
"You know, right now, it's a little bit more than 50-50",neg,train
The retail with Scottrade is about 55% of our total assets,neg,train
And then the cash to AUM is higher in the retail business,neg,train
So the cash numbers would be even bigger than that,neg,test
And no color on the breakdown of the assets in the different books?,neg,train
"And then just on the BDAs, if we kind of put a pin to like the rate pickup you got from the $1",neg,train
Is the plan here a little bit to get the third-party banks and TD to compete a little bit? To get a better kind of net yield for you guys? Or are you just going to roll it at the same third-party bank or planning to move that over to TD to kind of generically?,neg,train
"And then the only other one, just based on the current yield curve, is it fair to think that you would be above the high end of the BDA yield guide for the year? Just based on the way things stand today?",neg,train
And now I'm going to turn it over to Steve for some comments on the financials,neg,train
"But other than that, the rest of the ITA agreement is intact and they're no changes there",neg,train
"And you know, and all those ready to take outlook if we see any cracks anywhere in the economy, we don't see them yet",neg,train
Can you just give us an update in terms of what you're doing to drive or get that NIM moving higher by the time you come out of the FDIC loss share?,neg,train
"So that’s our third business, deposit pricing is pretty hot",neg,train
"We would never be comfortable taking on very, very large accounts",neg,train
So that's sort of a risk management threshold that we have,neg,train
We don't like to take on billion-dollar accounts because that creates too much volatility in our product portfolio,neg,train
"And let me let me just say too with the loan sales, one of the things I think you probably understand that that loan sale gain is not like a windfall",neg,train
That's just taking part of that giant accretable yield number and pulling it into this quarter,neg,train
It's just all about timing of when those earnings come in,neg,train

"The cost of deposits rose to 94 basis points compared to 87 basis points from the previous quarter and compared to 59 basis points for the corresponding quarter in 2016, but very importantly, tangible book value per share grew by 23% over the last year including the tax benefit, but more importantly, I don't look at this on a year-to-year basis",neg,train
"On the loans and leases basis, the noncovered loan portfolio remains very well diversified across all of our platforms with Florida and the national companies now comprising a larger portion given the shift that we've have with respect to New York multifamily loans",neg,train
"We’ve added to the team over the course of the last year, and we continue to add like the California expansion that I talked about which happened only this month",neg,train
"The business mix over there has been heavily skewed towards interest-bearing accounts, with over 90% of it being interest-bearing, and I think only 7% or 8% is DDA",neg,train
This is the year for them to actually move the needle on bringing in for DDA,neg,train
"And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Raj",neg,train
And I am showing no further questions at this time,neg,train
I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Singh for any closing remarks,neg,train
"The mortgage warehouse business did dip slightly seasonally in the fourth quarter, but remained a strong grower throughout the year for us",neg,train
"New York multifamily portfolio continues to runoff a decline by $169 million for the quarter, but that was more than offsetting New York by $198 million and growth across all other portfolio segments, which would include CRE non-multifamily growth of $82 million, owner-occupied C&I CRE type loans of $43 million and then C&I loans of $72 million",neg,train
It was a very strong year for us in New York in the C&I markets across the Board,neg,train
"We talked about the dividend with our board, and our board felt at this point of time that the dividend is in a good place relative to our peers and our payout ratio is in a good place",neg,train
"And then, Raj, you kind of mentioned your focus is really on kind of 2020 as you think kind of mid to longer term",neg,train
"But when we were putting this together back in late fourth quarter, the curve, it’s not looking very good",neg,train
"So, you're never precisely sure when that's going to occur",neg,train
"Across the individual units, the national platform growth included a $162 million of residential growth, $131 million within clinical finance and $60 million within the bridge finance group",neg,train
"So, it was a strong quarter all the way around for all of the national businesses",neg,test
"On the other hand, there are other business plans that have better margins whether it's warehouse lending with Florida C&I or what have you and we’re putting out, getting more capital to those businesses and overall growth we've taken down quite meaningfully",neg,train
"Quickly in terms of guidance, let me give you for next year",neg,train
"We're expecting 10% to 15% loan growth, 10% to 15% deposit growth and high single-digit expense growth",neg,train
"Again, we saw increases again in the yield on both noncovered and covered loans linked quarter and compared to the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
Cost of deposits was up 7 basis points to 94 basis points from 87 linked quarter,neg,train
The combined yield on the FDIC set in the covered loans for the quarter was just shy of 17% and right around 13% for the whole year,neg,train
The net interest margin for 2018 if we didn't take into account the impact of the reduction in the federal tax rate on our tax equivalent yields was then projected at about 350 and then we estimate around a nine-basis point impact to that from adjusting the tax equivalent yield on our tax-exempt assets to take into account the change in the tax rate from 35% to 21%,neg,train
I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Ms,neg,test
65% due to higher cost of funds and continued to run off as covered loans,neg,train
"58% for 2016, while the overall yield on earning assets, which was also impacted by -- slightly by that retrospective accounting adjustment, but it increased to 4",neg,train
And the cost of deposits increased to 83 basis points for 2017 from 66 basis points for 2016,neg,train
"We've always targeted at the consolidated level, the Basel III fully phased in including the capital conservation buffer plus a cushion of somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 to 100 basis points",neg,train
"As loans come due and are refinanced to normal amortization and for the reasons Tom mentioned, while we are originating loans, not enough to offset that natural run-off",neg,train
"So, we’re far, far away from 300% but that’s not the reason why multi-family has been taking down",neg,train
We certainly don't want to cross 300% but the same time we want more diversity on our portfolio,neg,train
"And we were not, especially going back a year ago or a year and a half ago, we were really extremely heavily weighted into multifamily and we're trying to build a more diverse portfolio",neg,train
"From a deposit perspective, it was a good deposit quarter across the Board",neg,train
"From the day we started the company, we’ve had – our deposits have almost tripled in size but our internal threshold of what we take on is the biggest account has not changed or at least not meaningful",neg,train
"And then just one last one just on the loan growth guide, how much of that multifamily, the New York City multifamily run-off are you baking into that guidance at this point?",neg,train
And second quarter for the same reasons will be a strong quarter just because everything comes back in the second quarter,neg,train
So please keep that in your mind and keep that in your models,neg,train
I think the best way to look at our numbers is really in a fourth quarter rolling basis than any one quarter,neg,test
"So, you know we have the benefit in Florida that you really five major non-core related completely economies happening in each of the major markets we're in, obviously Miami, Fort Lauderdale Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville",neg,train
"Maybe at that time it's slightly less expense growth for that region but it's not like it'll be such a meaningful decline that you will be able to see, expect it’s going down from 19 to 20",neg,train
"There is expense saves, but it's been hard to quantify and we've never actually put a number out there",neg,train
"And then one other question in terms of your long-term margin outlook right, I got the 350, sort of less 9 basis points but once you get past all the FDIC accounting noise, so you're in the back half of 2019 and obviously your core NIM right now seem fairly low, I should say, sub 3%",neg,train
We sold substantially all of the covered home equity loans and lines of credit during the fourth quarter,neg,train
This transaction had a net positive impact on pretax earnings of $16,neg,train
2 million due to the recognition of the remaining accretable yield on that pool,neg,train
"Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U",neg,train
"Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those indicated in these statements",neg,train
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements can be found in our earnings release and our SEC filings,neg,train
We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements now or anytime in the future,neg,train
"As Raj mentioned, the New York multifamily business is not today particularly high margin business, so as we expand into some of these more in a more robust way into some of these other asset classes, that should also have the impact of bringing slightly higher yielding assets on the balance sheet",neg,train
"Jason, we've -- while we've said that while there are expenses related to loss share and they are spread all over the company, it is hard for us to quantify and say that this is the total number",neg,train
"So, there will be a -- you shouldn’t expect prices to dip",neg,train
Like this year we're talking about high-single digit expense growth,neg,train
We have a retrospective accounting adjustment resulting from an increase in prepayment speeds on certain securities in our bond portfolio that had the impact of reducing the yield on securities for the quarter by 20 basis points and actually reduced the NIM for the quarter by five basis points,neg,train
So that was impactful this quarter and I wanted to make you aware of it,neg,train
We completed during the quarter our borrower-by-borrower analysis of the impact of that and released a substantial portion of that reserve,neg,train
"We still got a $1 million, which we allocated to portfolios where we think there may be some exposure",neg,train
"So, having said that, let me thank everyone for joining us and this has been a remarkable year and an eventful quarter to put it mildly",neg,train
"This year in 2017, we delivered double-digit earnings growth, double-digit EPS growth, double-digit loan growth, double-digit deposit growth",neg,train
"Also, I'd like to say that I am actually very disappointed that we only have 94 people on the call today",neg,train
"Usually we have a lot more on a quarter like the one we had, I was hoping that it would be a much bigger number, but I understand that are a number of banks reporting this morning",neg,train
Though for the full year 2017 loans and leases grew by $2,neg,train
4 billion and our loan-to-deposit ratio went in the right direction,neg,test
"Credit quality remained strong with one exception, which is taxi",neg,train
"I hate talking about it, but that's nevertheless the only thing to talk about on the credit front",neg,train
"When we think about the loss share agreement expiring in May of 2019, what kind of level of related expenses do you think might be able to be cut when the covered loans go away? I mean, I know it might be a bit early, but at least on a conceptual basis, do you think expenses come down meaningfully, or would these maybe be reinvested? How are you thinking about that?",neg,train
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
"Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call may be recorded",neg,train
I'll talk a little bit about yield and the NIM for the quarter,neg,train
This quarter we did have a little bit of an usual item affecting the yield on earning assets,neg,train
"Given this significant vision of capital, our Board recently met and authorized a $150 million repurchase program, a share repurchase program",neg,train
"So, with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take any questions",neg,train
And we have $280 million roughly of UPB a year that we can sell but I frankly don't have that number in front of me,neg,train
"Now, I don't really know why they thought that but it did happen",neg,train
"So, it wasn't – I don't think we've really seen a significant shift in mix",neg,train
It was more just that kind of one-off activity by a couple of large customers,neg,train
"Talking about balance sheet growth, fourth quarter was a strong quarter for us on all fronts",neg,train
Loans and leases grew by $852 million and deposits grew by $655 million,neg,train
"Over the last three quarters before this, loan growth was always a little less or deposit growth was outpacing loan growth three quarters in a row, but this quarter it flipped and we had more loan growth than deposit growth",neg,train
I would like to see a slight movement in the long end of the curve over the last two or three weeks,neg,train
I hope that it's sustained and I hope it gets even steeper,neg,train
Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America,neg,train
"So, what's in our guidance right now is a pretty flat curve",neg,train
"Talk a little bit about reserves and the provision, the total provision for the quarter related to noncovered loans was $6",neg,test
"6 million as decreases in the net charge-off rates that we use to calculate our general reserves, partially offsetting that as well as reductions in some of our specifically reserves and additionally, we had put up last quarter a $5 million unallocated reserve related to the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey",neg,train
Instead of giving you a number of growth probably give you a range,neg,train
"So, 10% to 15% is –it’s hard to – a number is just a little hard to solve to",neg,train
Our next question comes from David Bishop from FIG Partners,neg,train
"As you all know already that we did recognize a discrete tax benefit, let me get the map of that out of the way first and we'll talk about the rest of the company",neg,train
We booked $328 million roughly of this discrete tax benefit,neg,train
"It's made up of $295 million anticipated federal refund, which we've already talked about",neg,train
"We run with a little bit more capital at the bank than we do at the holding company because of that further growth is happening and generally, TCE to TA is not 8 so -- but none of that has changed",neg,test
"It is tough in both markets, in New York as well as in Florida",neg,train
"It's up in retail, more on the CD front, and with commercials more in the money market space, not so much yet in ECR, but you see that creeping up as well",neg,test
"It's not just banks that we used to well, just compete against",neg,train
"I'm just wondering why are you not re-engaging in that market given sort of the regulatory backdrop and the core sort of niche where you were sort of catering to, probably still relatively healthy in New York",neg,train
"If you look at the C&I business, for example, we have recently expanded our C&I lending capability by bringing in a team in the Westchester market",neg,test
We have an office in Rye Brook that’s now servicing Westchester and Connecticut,neg,train
"And then just one more if I could in terms of you could -- if you could talk about deposit pricing, competition in your various markets",neg,train
"So, from a C&I perspective, it’s very broad across all industry segments and across all geographies",neg,test
"That’s the time we put pencil down on putting our business plan together, which will be a couple of months ago",neg,train
"So, it's a fairly flat curve and I believe it factors in three moves by the fed in 2018",neg,train
"Brady, we're not going to show our hand too much on the buyback for obvious reasons",neg,train
"The board is discussing the parameters of the buyback, and we will follow the guidance that we get from the board and advice we get from our friends at capital markets",neg,train
"So, the answer to that question because I asked it myself, is actually very pedantic and unsexy",neg,test
"What happened weirdly in the third quarter after when the hurricane hit, we had several large customers who thought for some reason that they'd rather have their money in interest-bearing checking accounts than in money market account",neg,train
Mortgage warehouse I think will – the utilization will drop just like it did last year and the year before,neg,train
"So, C&I will have a slow quarter but that doesn't mean you should look at one quarter and annualized",neg,train
"And then finally for me, could you just give an update on what is remaining for loan sales under the loss share agreement through this May, measurement period?",neg,test
"But I will declare victory only two years out, not yet",neg,train
"It's too difficult to tell how, in any of the tax-exposed businesses, how the competition is going to respond right now",neg,test
So that recent steepening is not factored into our guidance,neg,train
Good morning and thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call,neg,train
"On our call this morning are Raj Singh, our President and CEO; Leslie Lunak, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Cornish, our Chief Operating Officer",neg,train

"As you think about the core bank that you've built and continue to build, what do you think is a realistic mid- to long-term target for profitability maybe with respect to ROA or ROE or how you look at it?",neg,train
"Over the period between now and termination of loss share pre-tax, we expect $445 million in accretion and $141 million in amortization in the indemnification asset",neg,train
And net of tax at a marginal rate of 26,neg,train
"The regulatory concerns with New York multifamily as an asset class, I don't think that has to do with any particular regulation out there",neg,train
I would also add that the transactional volume in the New York multi-family market is down significantly from previous years,neg,train
"In fact, as the yield curve has flattened out, they've gotten worse",neg,train
"And two, it’s not the 300% that we're solving for",neg,train
"And then just on the margin, what are you guys baking into your NIM guidance for rate hikes in the shape of the curve?",neg,train
"And then as we look at the head winds or the continued pay down on the multifamily side and assume that we start to – the relative impact for that goes down, should we be thinking that the rate of growth increases as we go through the year and starting 2019 that that maybe higher run rate?",neg,train
"And then on the buyback, it's great to see you guys announce a buyback",neg,train
The stock has had a nice move over the last three or four months,neg,train
"So, I was just wondering how price-sensitive or price-focused will you be in repurchasing this $150 million?",neg,train
"With that, I will turn this over to Tom who will talk a little more about each of the business volumes",neg,train
No one thing sort of eclipsing and no one business line eclipsing this,neg,train
"Pretty broad based across the Board with the exception of multifamily, which have been running down and that will continue and mortgage warehouse lending, which was seasonally down, only $5 million or $6 million, but everything else was up nicely",neg,train
"I guess interest-bearing up about 10 basis points the past couple of quarters, savings money market up about 9 or so",neg,train
Leslie will give you a lot more details on the NIM when she gets to her section and the NIM was $3,neg,train
Decline in NIM has always been the case with us is really directly related to the runoff of the lost share loans and now we're in the last 18 months or so of lost share and an increase in cost of funds,neg,train
"And secondly, in terms of with the buyback, could you talk about how you view the capital levels in conjunction with the double-digit loan and deposit growth? Any targets on the capital ratios that we should think about?",neg,test
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lana Chan from BMO Capital Markets,neg,train
And our next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
"As Raj noted, if you look at the quarter, it was a strong quarter for us",neg,train
"Florida grew by $465 million for the quarter, while the national platform grew by $359 million",neg,train
"New York as expected, remained relatively flat, but did grow by $29 million for the quarter",neg,train
"Our Florida, CRE portfolio, which had just a little under $500 million of growth for the year, also has many of those same attributes as it relates to both geographic and product distribution across the markets",neg,test
We currently expect the ETR for 2018 to be between 23% and 24%,neg,train
That really assumes no material change in our asset mix or tax strategies because we don't have time to fully evaluate any of those options yet,neg,train
"That is slightly higher than the federal statutory rate because it includes stated taxes and the federal benefit of deducting those is now lower and we are obviously receiving a lower benefit from our tax-advantaged assets and there is also the non-deductibility of a portion of the FDIC premium, but we are still seeing a material decline in our effective tax rate and the positive impact to earnings from a tax law change",neg,train
And if I can sneak in one last for Leslie,neg,train
"Sorry if I missed it in your remarks but the high single digit expense growth, is that relative to your reported expense number less the FDIC amortization expense or should we be making any other adjustments?",neg,train
"And maybe one last one if I could, and maybe for Tom",neg,train
"Kind of now that we've got the certainty around tax reform, would you expect kind of the loan demand or the growth at Pinnacle in 2018 would be greater than 2017?",neg,train
And we've been hired a producer in California last quarter or actually maybe this quarter…,neg,test
"Well, in some ways, that actually becomes harder to answer now after-tax reform because the question everyone is wondering here is what will happen to the increased return on equity from lower taxes",neg,train
But you're expecting that to I guess continue to run down through the year?,neg,train
"And then in terms of just a quarter-over-quarter deposit pricing interest-bearing deposit cost, look like a pretty similar basis point move in terms of cost of those deposits",neg,train
"What I would add to that, that does not mean opening branches in New Jersey or West Coast?",neg,train
"So, when you look at the loan loss reserve, I know on a percentage basis that declined, I think, around seven or eight basis points linked-quarter, Leslie, I know you talked about how releasing some of the Irma, what you had reserved last quarter",neg,train
"In terms of your – the New York City – the non-multifamily market, right, if we think about sort of traditionally, the multifamily market in New York is very broker-driven",neg,train
"You have a couple offices in New York, and you can do a lot of business, right, in theory because you work with the brokers",neg,train
Our next question comes from Erik Zwick from Stephens Incorporated,neg,train
"A quick update on the taxi portfolio, which we're getting really tired of talking about, but it's still there",neg,train
"Total exposure is now $106 million, down from $121 million at September 30",neg,train
5 in charge-offs today referenced and little over $5 million in payments that we received,neg,train
"Just from a macro perspective, we see why we can't see too far out into the future",neg,train
"What we do see into the future, the next, over the next 6 or 12 months, we see a fairly healthy economy in both of our primary markets and then even nationally where we play",neg,train
"In the C&I book, we're seeing a large growth in basic wholesaling and distribution businesses",neg,train
We're seeing significant growth for the year in healthcare-related business segments which make up about 19% today of the Florida GMP,neg,train
"Yes, more the conceptual concepts of what you guys are working on",neg,test
Having the city number moved up from 50 to a higher number takes a lot of a medium-term pressure off,neg,train
"While we're not solving to be a $50 billion bank yet, we were going to have to start doing that soon",neg,train
"And so, relief on that front is very meaningful, not for 2018, but it's very meaningful for the medium term",neg,train
So that's -- we'll see if that ever becomes the law of the land but we're hopeful,neg,train
It's come a long way in the last two or three months and it seems to have bipartisan support which as you know very few things in D,neg,train
"Let me correct the operator by saying Lisa is heading Corporate Development, Strategy and Marketing",neg,train
"Some of it will – it’s still rolling through, and this quarter, you will see the full impact",neg,test
"So, there will be some of that, but I'd rather not get into the line-by-line analysis of that on this call",neg,train
I think we use trailing prepayment rate that who knows is it’s actually going to materialize,neg,train
There's more moving parts to this and just as – I’ll give you an example,neg,test
It’s still will not be extremely high margin businesses because we've chosen not to be in the risky businesses,neg,test
You want to do certain kind of consumer lending; you can get a lot more margin,neg,train
"But without changing the risk culture, there are tricks you can make to the business mix to move your margin higher over the course of next year and a half, two years",neg,train
Just wanted to double-check in terms of guidance for 2018,neg,test
"We were doing business -- starting to do more and more business in the West Coast and we did coverage on the West Coast, and we’ve hired our first producer in California",neg,train
Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"Maybe if I start with Leslie, just kind of one more question on the margin",neg,train
What deposit beta are you expecting in your 2018 guidance?,neg,train
We have a very conservative limit compared to the size of some of these accounts,neg,test
"We will never take on that much, but they had about $20 billion of business and we’re never expecting to get $20 billion out of it",neg,test
"I think I publicly said, if you get a third of that over the course of few years that will be a home run for us",neg,train
It looks like there was a little bit of a mixed shift going on this quarter from interest-bearing checking and to money market savings,neg,train
We don't have any certainty at all about how the market for municipal finance is going to respond to that,neg,train
"I think just first a question in terms of Raj, would love to hear your thoughts around the Florida economy where C&I CRE growth is coming because clearly, there’s some concern about the run up in real estate markets and how we should think about sort of the non-owner-occupied growth ratcheting up on Florida? A color around C&I and CRE in Florida would be helpful",neg,train
"So that's a pretty significant increase in our resource capability in that market, and our C&I and business banking books both in the New York market grew very substantially for the year",neg,train
"And from a CRE perspective, we’re tilting towards other asset classes",neg,test
"We have done a fairly significant amount of new production in our current pipeline, it’s more focused on non-New York City multifamily",neg,train
Each has its own industry segments and each are growing rapidly across virtually all industry segments that we're in,neg,train
Anything going on there related to deposit promotions or is some of your peers out there have had some tax planning strategies from some of their commercial clients there? Just curious if you saw any that transitional shift related to what's happening from a broader tax perspective,neg,train
"And, Raj, you mentioned about regulatory relief possibly some legislation",neg,train
I'm assuming you were alluding to the SIFI asset threshold,neg,train
What you're saying is this is the year for that mix shift,neg,train
Is this also the year where they're going after some of the bigger deposit accounts that they were dealing with in their prior institution?,neg,train
Over a month of the portfolio doesn't change in a quarter or two or even a year; it takes a while because these are long-dated assets,neg,train
But 2020 is when everything is sort of all behind us and that's plenty of time to shift our business mix to higher margin businesses,neg,train
"Overall, I think that New York CRE business will be fine because we're doing other kinds of CRE business",neg,train
"It won't be – it won't grow at an impressive pace like it did couple of years ago, but it will be fairly stable and you'll see that change in sort of mix where New York multi-family going down and other types of CRE or owner occupied, non-owner occupied CRE continue to grow",neg,train
5 million of which were in the most recent quarter and the entire portfolio remains on nonaccrual,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Overall C&I growth for the quarter was $175 million and as we alluded to last quarter, we through our CRE growth in Florida would be better than all three quarters previously combined and it was $284 million including all asset segments within the CRE segment",neg,train
"As an industry, are we going to compete it away or are we going to preserve it and keep dropping it the bottom line",neg,train
"We’ve never published numbers as to exactly what level they're at, but they are at a pretty decent place relative to the business plan that they laid out for us when we started that business",neg,test
"The first year and a half, it's been about a year, I think, yeah, since they’ve been here, the team has been here",neg,train
"I think we will revisit the dividend post loss share and that's probably the most likely time that the board will look at this again that maybe the second half of 2019 or early 2020, I don't know yet",neg,test
But I think we'll probably wait till the loss share is over,neg,test
"And I'm just wondering why are we letting multi-family New York run-off again this year? I mean, I'm just wondering it seemed like you didn't want to cross the 300% threshold, you slowed down growth there",neg,train
"And then just on the capital side, the great news on the buyback there but with the dividend payout ratio coming down and the growth rate relatively similar, should we expect to see maybe potentially other capital management strategies coming into play besides the buyback whether that's an increase dividend or a special dividend?",neg,train
"If we look at both the growth in C&I Florida and CRE, Florida the first thing I would say is, it is broadly geographically distributed around the state",neg,train
"To talk for a minute about tax, as you already about the large tax benefit we booked this quarter, some belabor that",neg,train
"In addition to that, we did record a benefit of $3",neg,train
7 million related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the change in the federal tax rate,neg,train
Net income for the year came in at $614 million or $5,neg,test
"58 per share and if you exclude the tax benefit, it was $291",neg,test
"09 from last year; a very, very impressive 27% increase in EPS over the prior year",neg,train
That are probably not as appropriate for the commercial banking industry versus other longer-term industry structures,neg,train
Changing business mix to the bottom line is what will drive higher margin,neg,train
"You can’t just say one higher margin, want to keep doing the same thing that I was doing yesterday",neg,train
Our next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"And honestly, we don't know how the market will respond to the new tax law",neg,train
"In fact, in some states like New York and California, individual tax rates for high net worth individuals actually gone up including state taxes",neg,test
"But overall in New York, the growth will be lower than national in Florida because of the headwinds from the New York multifamily portfolio",neg,train
Some of that impact was felt for the month of December,neg,train
"On your deposit growth outlook, I was just wondering what your thoughts are on the large deposit teams’ contribution to that",neg,train
"The first year and a half, the expectation was always that it’s going to be more interest-bearing",neg,train
"So, this year, the goals are not just to keep growing the total but also to change the mix",neg,test
"So far, we’re very happy with their progress and what they've achieved in a very short period of time",neg,train
"So, from a C&I perspective, the growth is pretty broad",neg,train
We've always had a major sector related to food and beverage distribution which we like that segment a lot and we're a significant player in that market and we think that's very recession-proof,neg,train
"Margin is dictated by the markets that you operate and if you don’t like the market and you got to go find another market, another product, that's exactly what we're doing",neg,train
"We're not abandoning let’s say multi-family, we’re still a player in multi-family, but we are de-emphasizing it before",neg,train
There is no other signs of systemic credit deterioration anywhere else in the portfolio with that one exception,neg,train
Our nonperforming loans ratio at the end of the year was at 82 basis points and 51 of that 82 basis points was attributable to taxi,neg,train
Our net charge-offs last year in the non-covered portfolio was 38 basis points and 29 of that 38 basis points was taxi,neg,train
"And then lastly from me, Leslie, you mentioned the prepayment adjustments down in the bond yield that added 20 basis points – or took away 20 basis points",neg,train
"Is that – that's just a onetime thing that will not be recurring, correct?",neg,train
"So, to try and predict – yeah, actually I have one example",neg,train
I can talk about each one of our business lines,neg,train
"2019, when we get there at this time next year, based on what the economy is doing, based on what regulation is doing and where the margins are, we'll give you guidance again",neg,train
But it's just hard to say – I will say one thing,neg,train
We put an 8K out I think in late November,neg,train
2 million in estimated state tax benefit and an estimated $8,neg,train
"But as we look at the reserve going forward, it seems like 70-ish basis points should be a low point and over time that should trend higher",neg,train
Is that the right way to think about the reserve from here?,neg,train
"But if that number moves out, it helps tremendously with CCAR and LCR",neg,train
"I wouldn't expect it over the course of the next year to trend materially higher than that unless, as I said, we see something develop in the economy or in one of our markets that we think is putting pressure on credit",neg,train
"But generally, yes, I think that's a reasonable way to look at it",neg,train
1 billion or about 29% and the national portfolio also was $7,neg,train
So that's all we're solving for without the tax benefit,neg,test
"Once again, we're very happy with the way the quarter turned out",neg,train
We're very happy with the way the year turned out,neg,train
"And with that, we’ll sign off and we'll talk to you again in 90 days",neg,train
Our general outlook for most of those asset categories is fairly strong,neg,test
I would probably say the only market where we might have some level of slight negativity would be the high-end hospitality market in Miami-Dade County,neg,train
"79 per share, but if you take out the tax benefit, the net income was also very impressive at $94",neg,test
3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 or $0,neg,test
59 per share and I think the third quarter number was $0,neg,test
"And we expect to get there on a core basis, not just with loss share, but on a core basis like you said medium to long term",neg,train
I'll turn it back over to Raj for any closing remarks,neg,train
"5 billion a year, and you can be more selective",neg,train
"So, the business that is coming on today, if I just compare this to two years ago, it’s coming on at a higher margin",neg,train
"Actually, two weeks ago, we opened up our first office",neg,train
"Well, actually about last week officially in New Jersey, we brought in a team from another bank to focus on the New Jersey middle market",neg,train
"Raj, when you're talking about the growth for 2018 and looking similarly what we saw for 2017, are you talking more dollars or rate of growth as we look out over the year?",neg,train
"I look at it over the long-term since our IPO, which was in 2011 we have grown by 11",neg,train
6% CAGR and we've don't that while paying a pretty healthy dividend of $0,neg,train
and all of the things that Tom's been talking about with respect to diversification of loan portfolio,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference",neg,train
It’s not like they have lots and lots of equal million-dollar accounts,neg,train
"The average goods size or average account size already is large, but we have not changed our threshold for sort of the largest account size it will take on, I think ever in the company",neg,train
"But other than that, office remains strong, multi-family remains strong, the commercial and industrial markets from a leased-up perspective are extremely strong across all of the major markets that we're in, particularly Miami-Dade County",neg,train
"So, it's pretty broadly diversified both state-wise, product-wise and industry segment-wise in Florida",neg,train
"That methodology itself for evaluation of $304,000 this quarter, down from $351,000 last quarter",neg,train
So that leaves the reserve on the portfolio about $12,neg,train
"Other than taxi, unless we see evidence of deterioration in the economy generally or conditions in our primary markets which we aren’t currently seeing, I wouldn't expect reserve levels to change materially so I would think they would be somewhere in the 70, 75 basis point range over the course of the next year",neg,train
"(NYSE:BKU) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2018  9:00 AM ET",neg,train
The tax law change will be another boost to the economy especially here in Florida,neg,train
And the regulatory climate is getting better as been reported numerous times,neg,train
All positive news for us and the industry and for the country,neg,train
"So overall, the reduction in the allowance for the quarter was primarily a result of charge-offs taken, which is a total of $15",neg,train
5 million of which was taxi and that's the main thing that is leading to the reduction in the allowance for the quarter as well as that parcel release of the hurricane reserve,neg,train
And welcome to BankUnited Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Call,neg,train
"So, there's some positive stuff that's not really baked into that",neg,train
"So, all else being equal, NIM steps up 5 bps",neg,train
The area that I alluded to in my opening comments really is pretty small segment for us,neg,train
"So, it’s in the public space which is just under 10% and specifically it’s in the time space, which is about half of that 10%",neg,train
So just over 5% of our overall book and what we’re seeing there is pricing that substantially higher than what we’re seeing for like term and just about all of our other segments,neg,train
We’re seeing pricing well in excess of 1% for terms that are well below a year,neg,train
I'd also like to ask about the impact of corporate tax reform specifically on the residential mortgage portfolio,neg,train
And in particular I'm interested in any impact you might perceive from cap on mortgage interest deductibility on the growth of that portfolio this year?,neg,train
"So while Dean finds out the exact number on overdraft fees, I'll tell you, we're wondering down -- we're wondering down for a couple of reasons",neg,train
"One, we are making certain changes to our procedures and processes and policies that reduced in lower ODs overtime",neg,train
"And secondly, we take a pretty conservative approach to our opt-in activity",neg,train
So I know that some banks generally encourage opt-in as almost a business,neg,train
We actually are trying to get a more neutral positioning out there,neg,train
And so that has had on impact on people choosing not to opt-in which obviously impacts our OD revenue,neg,train
"Do you have -- do you actually -- do you have cost of those pieces? In other words, what was the cost on your…",neg,test
"Obviously, we don’t need to turn to any funding just because we have that liquidity",neg,train
So that’s the positioning that we’re taking at this point,neg,train
"So if you look at fourth quarter ‘17 versus fourth quarter ‘16, you see the performance actually was pretty good",neg,train
"3 million and RSU cost, last year which was really as a result of the run-up in the stock price last year",neg,train
"So if you look at it on a seasonal basis, 4Q to 4Q, we’re probably in line with where our expense better has been all the year",neg,train
You’ve joined the Bank of Hawaii Corporation Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call,neg,train
"At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
"Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time",neg,train
"And then just it looks like our pipe is overall looking pretty strong for the year 2018, but the first quarter is looking little weak",neg,train
"And actually it was just new is to whether or not uncertainty around the tax legislation or not, but not exactly for what the reasoning is there",neg,train
Switching to expenses and curious to -- I guess even backing out the special bonus that you guys paid to employees this quarter,neg,train
So it's seems like comp occupancy professional fees and the other line all just seen a little bit elevated,neg,train
Just wondering if maybe there were some kind of year-end clean up in those numbers? And maybe what the -- what a good run rate might be for your overall non-interest income heading into 2018?,neg,train
And then what you do see an impact is the deductibility versus the benefit in tax rates is really in the affluent segment,neg,train
"And there we'll see how that turns out, but also remember that there is $1 million cap on mortgage deductibility in any event and that really hasn't changed much from the prior tax build",neg,train
So it's something to think about we'll keep trying to analyze and figure it out,neg,test
But I guess our positioning for now is we're not terribly concerned about it,neg,train
"Asides in the one-tenth bonuses in the fourth quarter, this raise your minimum wage say $15 a share",neg,train
Do you have an actual dollar amount because I don’t know how many are of your employees are now $15? Do you -- can you just help us understand an actual dollar amount?,neg,train
"And then just wanting to hear you thoughts on the corporate tax rate and just any optimism if that may have created in Hawaii? And do you think that helps further on realized CNI is not a huge thing in Hawaii relative to the mainland, but just does this help industries in Hawaii? And do you think that you’ll see some benefit from that in your lending operations this year?",neg,train
Thanks again for joining us today and now we’d be happy to respond to your questions,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer of Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
Wanted to just to go back to the expenses for a second,neg,train
"One rate and merit increases, are there other projects that are going on? Or can you give us a flavor for anything else you got some terms of initiatives that migrates your expenses you have pretty modest growth and expenses launched here?",neg,train
"No, I think we’re going to stay with our current strategy which is ultimately 50% of net income in dividends and of course adding retaining enough for our business growth and then the remainder would be available for share repurchases",neg,train
So we’re going to pretty much stick to that plan,neg,train
"Currently, we expect the effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 20% and 22%",neg,test
"As a result of our strong loan growth during the quarter, our investments portfolio decreased to $6",neg,train
1 million in the fourth quarter essentially flat with the previous quarter and down from $11,neg,train
We purchase the total of $210 million in fixed rate securities during the quarter and the reinvestment differential was a positive 53 basis points,neg,train
The duration for the available for sale portfolio was 2,neg,train
"29 years at the end of the fourth quarter, the held to maturity duration was 3",neg,train
"93 years, and the duration for the total portfolio was 3",neg,train
Loan growth of 9% was led by consumer growth during the year,neg,train
Deposits grew 4% in 2017 finishing it just under $14,neg,train
Deposits fell slightly on a linked basis compared to the third quarter of 2017 as solid consumer deposit growth of 2,neg,train
4% was offset by slightly lower commercial activity and lower public deposit activity,neg,train
"In other words, as we think about the tax windfall that, again not totally dropping to bottom line…",neg,train
"So it’s, I think that the market dynamics out here, Ken, are -- the economy is still chugging along just fine",neg,train
"But there is no denying with that, we are definitely later in the cycle here",neg,train
"And so, I think bank employee and probably a lot of other institutions are tightening around the margins",neg,train
"We are seeing more activity in the non-bank fund space, which is what we hadn't seen in fact we’ve been talking for the past year or so that usually about this time, you start to see that form of competitor",neg,train
"And I’d say in the last six months, we've seen the marked increase in that space",neg,train
"4 billion that you stand out at December 31st, do you have a total cost on that?",neg,train
"The Hawaiian economy continues to perform well due to healthy labor market conditions and active construction pipeline, a continuation of the strong performance of our tourism industry, and increasing home prices",neg,train
The statewide seasonal adjusted unemployment rate was 2% in November compared with 4,neg,train
3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $88,neg,train
Non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 included onetime employee bonuses totaling $2,neg,train
"1 million in severance partially offset by a reduction of $900,000 in share base compensation",neg,train
And so the difference would be due to the salable component of the business,neg,train
So to the extent that we think that's going to start stabilizing next year,neg,test
The income from mortgage banking should be pretty stable from the fourth quarter,neg,train
Restructured loans not included in non-accrual loans or loans past due 90 days or more totaled $55,neg,train
7 million at the end of the quarter compared with $55 million at the end of the third quarter and $52,neg,train
Residential real estate loans modified to assist our customers accounted for $20,neg,train
2 million of the total at the end of ‘17,neg,train
"At the end of the fourth quarter, non-performing assets totaled $16",neg,train
"1 million or 16 basis points, down $915,000 or 2 basis points from the third quarter and down $3",neg,train
Loans past due of 90 days or more and still accruing interest totaled $7,neg,train
"1 million, up $483,000 for the linked period and up $77,000 from the same period last year",neg,train
"And from a fundamental standpoint, obviously banks, just in general and tightening underwriting standards for probably year, two years",neg,train
"Are you seeing any kind of, I would say demand changes based on that or type of borrower changes? Really just trying to get that decent sense for the fundamental to the series market, still seen really, really good, but obviously banks have been tightening and you guys been tightening, I’m sure everyone has just trying to prove guard against loss some future period?",neg,train
"With the 10-year up about 260, where is the reinvestment rate in the securities book versus that 230 yield in the fourth quarter?",neg,train
"And then just to go back to the expenses, I just want to make sure that I understand this here",neg,train
"If I am looking here at this other, other line within non-interest expense of 16",neg,train
"3 million, how much of that is seasonal holiday expense related I mean close to 2 million?",neg,train

I just a quick follow-up on expenses and a question on severance,neg,train
"In the past, I thought, we had discussed that there could more of that going forward and we didn’t see any in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"So just your outlook on what that might be in 2018, if any?",neg,train
"I think that the general guidance is not too changed from what we’ve expressed previously, and we talked about how commercial activity ought to moderate in the coming periods and that would be offset somewhat by stronger consumer growth",neg,train
We have a pretty big reduction in construction at this point,neg,train
The leasing portfolio was a headwind and mostly because we had a pretty large early buy out in the fourth quarter of about $25 million,neg,train
The one thing I will note there is that in the first quarter we do have a seasonal bump in expenses of about 2,neg,train
5 million and all of that is incorporated into the guidance we provided but that’s related to the incentive payout,neg,train
Also included is the increase in our minimum wage to $15 an hour in the 2,neg,train
"And just one last one on fees and mortgage banking, $2",neg,train
6 million this was much higher a few quarters ago,neg,train
If I'm right there is about $2 million of servicing fee revenue in that number and the rest is origination related,neg,train
Like what's your expectation on that as we go into '18?,neg,train
"8 million, up $313,000 on a linked quarter basis and up $775,000 year-over-year",neg,test
"For the full year of 2017, net charge-offs totaled $13",neg,train
8 million or 15 basis points of average loans and leases,neg,train
"Comparatively, net charge-offs for the full year of 2016, inclusive of a full recovery of a single commercial loan previously charged off in 2013 totaled $3",neg,train
"Adjusting for the non-recurring recovery, net charge-offs totaled $10 million or 12 basis points",neg,train
"At the end of the fourth quarter, the allowance for loan and lease losses totaled $107",neg,train
The ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases was 1,neg,train
"1% at the end of the quarter, down 2 basis points for the linked period and down 7 basis points year-over-year",neg,train
Included in the fourth quarter of 2017 was an additional income tax expense of $3,neg,train
6 million due to the reduction in value of our net deferred tax assets impacted by the tax reform bill,neg,train
It will hard to -- I would have to go back and sit down and calculate that,neg,train
"But if you look at what happened in the fourth quarter, essentially what happened was our cash balances, so the money as we hold at fed came down almost the same amount as the public time deposits ran up, didn’t really impact our income but it did impact our margin",neg,train
Non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 included expenses of $1,neg,train
"3 million related to the increase in the stock price, which was partially offset by a net gain of $1 million on the sale of a branch building",neg,train
"And then when I think about 2018 in terms of tax windfall investment, what’s the actual dollar amount on that, that’s going to impact your non-interest expense line? Obviously, you’ve got wage inflation, other initiatives you’re doing",neg,train
So just to emphasize Jeff that the increased proceeds generated by the tax change effective will get captured in our capital management plan that you’re familiar with simply because that plan is returning everything back to the shareholder with the exception of growth,neg,train
"And can you give any detail on -- I think Peter mentioned 10% of deposits are public funds, half of those are time deposits, so give or take $700 million",neg,train
What’s the rate on those and do we expect those to run off at some this year?,neg,train
The impact will be not much from a capital spending standpoint directly attributable to the change in the tax law,neg,train
I mentioned earlier that our depreciation is slightly to grow about $2,neg,train
5 million this year and that is mostly reinvesting into positive MTD [ph] deals,neg,train
But that really wasn’t -- that was already on the world prior to President Trump signing the bills,neg,train
"So, I wanted to include that, what I really include is the $15 minimum wage and that’s $2",neg,train
That’s a good question and obviously we thought about that,neg,train
"On first blush, you think that pricing people would seek elsewhere",neg,test
"So it doesn’t, at least statistically look like people are being force in the funding side",neg,train
"So I really -- I can’t answer the question except to tell you that it use to be a pretty nice pull of funding for us it’s raised for closer to zero, and as rates have risen that that's just not the case anymore",neg,train
First time I’ve heard you kind of talk about some rationale pricing in market,neg,train
"Give us some color there and also what is the appetite -- you guys are in a great position liquidity wise for the 65% loan to deposit ratio, where -- how much appetite is there to take that even higher? Is there a ceiling? Or how are you managing liquidity? And what could be a tougher deposit pricing environment?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America,neg,test
"At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to Ms",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Casey Haire of Jeffries,neg,train
"Well, the margin we expect some modest increases, and the drivers going to be mainly balance sheet growth",neg,train
But we do expect to pick up some on the rate side,neg,train
"The rate increase in December is going to help us to the extent that the longer end remains higher than last year, I think we’ll pick up more there",neg,train
"So overall, we’re going to report in our 10-K, a 3",neg,train
So that’s kind of a rough guide on how you can calculate the benefit from higher rates,neg,train
I would say quarter-over-quarter we’re looking at about a 10 basis point increase,neg,train
We’re still investing in I would say shorter duration investment,neg,train
"So in terms of a rate, it’s going to be below 3%, because we want to moderate our duration of our portfolio",neg,train
"But overall, we’re still growing the yield on the book",neg,train
"I'll tell you, I have been somewhat pleasantly surprised by how much perceived impact the tax change is creating",neg,train
"Clearly, we see it in the business community, people feeling like there is just excess capital being freed up here",neg,train
"Yet to be seen what happens on the consumer side, but not on the negative",neg,train
"So, overall we think it’s a modest positive for the local economy out here in the Island",neg,train
"Our net interest margin expanded, asset quality remain strong and our efficiency ratio improved to 55",neg,train
"Assets, loans and deposits each grew in a measured manner with total assets finishing the year in excess of $17 billion for the first time in our history",neg,train
"The link reduction in commercial deposits results from the closing of the few large condominium projects in the fourth quarter, which reduced deposit balances for some of our escrow customers",neg,train
Reduction in public deposits resulted from a $300 million decline in public time deposits resulting from our decision to not aggressively pursue this limited deposit segment,neg,train
"So, I’ll take a stab at it and Dean can clean up for my comments",neg,train
"The answer is yes, if you add the $15 minimum wage and what’s looking to be about a $2",neg,train
5 million increase for the year and depreciation that basically gets us to plus 2%,neg,train
"5%, I think the range there effectively from we’ve already input is kind of flat to up a bit, which I think would be about in-line with what we’ve done this last couple of years",neg,train
"Second question in, just in terms of commercial real estate, I heard when you said and I want to clarify that you said there is a slowdown in first quarter or is it fourth quarter? And then I have a real question",neg,train
And then just I wanted to make sure I’ve got that correct on the visa shares,neg,train
So there what we’re seeing really Q2 on is that is basically the carrying cost of holding that,neg,train
Could you break that out for me? And is that expectation is as long as you’re still holding that we’d see a drag on a quarterly basis?,neg,train
And now I’d now like to turn the call over to Peter Ho,neg,train
"For the full year of 2018, we expect Non-interest expenses to be above 2",neg,test
This includes the impact of increasing our minimum wage rate to $15 an hour,neg,train
"Excluding the onetime adjustment related to the tax reform bill, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 27",neg,train
Months of inventory in December declined to a low 2,neg,train
The median number of days on the market during 2017 was 16 days for single-family home and 17 days for a condominium,neg,train
2017 was another good year for Bank of Hawaii and we’re pleased with our financial results,neg,train
I will talk about the fourth quarter and Dean will chat about our guidance for 2018,neg,train
I think probably the best comp to look at for the fourth quarter is the year-on-year,neg,train
We do have a fair amount of seasonality in the fourth quarter with holiday expenses and alike as well as we commission a number of studies and consulting arrangements in the fourth quarter as we close out the year,neg,train
"And then finally, as it relates to trust and asset management line item, it's been a pretty strong quarter or pretty strong year rather for the market and the fee income there really didn't grow all that much",neg,train
So what initiatives do you have in place to show better progress in that area in 2018?,neg,train
"I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations Ms",neg,train
"And just switching very quickly on the last question on the fee revenue, I think you've mentioned that we expect growth to remain challenges based on the declining overdraft fees",neg,train
How big is overdraft fee? And is it going down because of any changes you've made? Or are you just seen lower less activity because of sort of the consumer backdrop right now?,neg,train
"Yes, the actual number Ebrahim is $838 million on public time",neg,train
"Based on our win loss record under the pricing environment, we could see as much as half of that 838 disappear over the course of this year would be my estimate, if pricing holds where it has the past several months",neg,train
"So, is it fair to say that incrementally that kind of the pace of decline, if we see more decline of that sort of reasonable rate in the quarter?",neg,train
"All in all though, we feel good about what we achieved in 2017",neg,train
We also made considerable progress in our driving digital activity with 40% of our consumer deposits now coming from either our ATM or mobile applications,neg,train
"As I mentioned previously, we were pleased with our numbers for the year",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Rulis of DA Davidson,neg,train
"Bank of Hawaii Corporation (NYSE:BOH) Q4 2017 Results Conference Call January 22, 2018  1:00 PM ET",neg,train
We had good performance both on the commercial as well as on the consumer time space last year,neg,train
And so that would -- that we would anticipate that to continue for us,neg,train
And as I mentioned that’s coming in at substantial lower pricing on the government side,neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, underwriting metrics for loan originations remained strong as we continue to tighten around the margin",neg,train
"Accordingly, at the end of 2017, the weighted average loan-to-value for the commercial mortgage portfolio was 55% while the weighted average loan-to-value for the residential mortgage portfolio and the home equity portfolio was 57% and 63% respectively, and in the indirect portfolio the weighted average monitoring FICO score was 703",neg,train
The next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley,neg,test
Or are we just going to see in full your 2018 from the noninterest expense line?,neg,train
Maybe could you quantify the impact in the quarter of the release of the valuation allowance on the sale of the low income housing tax credits?,neg,train
So the -- obviously the 838 is going to be the most expensive,neg,test
"And Laurie as I mentioned earlier, we don't -- we haven’t disclosed pricing in the past and we’re just not going to do that in the future",neg,train
But I will tell you that the pricing on that public time book is pretty high,neg,train
"Let me give you some perspective on our deposit composition, Casey",neg,train
"2% of our deposits come from our consumer book, 40",neg,train
"So you can see that we’ve got a very, very solid core deposit base and really a skewing from a sector standpoint that's pretty diversified",neg,train
"5 billion in AUM, that's actually grown in the second half of the year",neg,train
We seem to be effectively equally trading off market gain for trust run off,neg,train
Our experience on the institutional side of late has been pretty strong,neg,train
"So, we've had some good success in garnering business there that's going to continue to be an area of emphasis for us",neg,train
I think we’re going to see some severance cost flowing through in 2018 and there likely to be episodic,neg,test
"So, I can't tell you exactly which quarters, but you'll probably see a few quarters with that kind of activity",neg,train
I would have to ballpark it at about less than 1 million,neg,train
"Before we get started, let me remind you that today’s conference call will contain some forward-looking statements",neg,test
"And while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, there are a variety of reasons that the actual results may differ materially from those projected",neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,train

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
"And then we've also had a fair amount of success, not so much on the trust side, but on the broker dealer side with our managed account business",neg,train
"So, I think that we’ve talked about mid higher single-digit growth on the loan portfolio",neg,train
"I think of that still holds, but one caveat that I’d put out there is, CRE is a little lighter than usual for us",neg,train
"And at this point, I’m not sure if that’s just a one-off periodic type of thing or a trend",neg,train
"But I would say that for first quarter, we have seen a bit of pause there, and that as we have been discussing it couldn’t be really as a result of uncertainty around the tax bill",neg,train
"So, that’s -- those are our thoughts on the lending side",neg,test
"Thank you for joining us today, as we review the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017",neg,train
"Joining me today is Chairman, President and CEO, Peter Ho; our Chief Financial Officer, Dean Shigemura; and our Chief Risk Officer, Mary Sellers",neg,test
"And how understanding that this may not be a known quantity, but how do you think it will compare 2017's level?",neg,train
"Let me try to understand that again Laurie, can you rephrase that for me?",neg,train
The allowance reflects the continued strength in the Company's asset quality and the Hawaii economy over this period as well as the mix and quality in loan growth,neg,train
"8 million year end, unchanged from the prior quarter and up $250,000 from the end of 2016",neg,train
"Really tough to tell, but if I were to venture, I'd say comparable to a little bit higher",neg,train
"So, we've actually try to as best as we can lay that out reflecting the input would be lower tax for a mid-segment on the mass affluent segment, and the outflow would be reduction in the benefit on the mortgage side",neg,test
"And at least what we have analyzed out is that, the net impact to the broader market isn't that rate as not clear that that's going to have a meaningful impact on the residential mortgage side",neg,train
Maybe a little bit more impact on the home equity side,neg,train
"Just following up on the, Dean, you’ve outlined that capital management plan and I guess if you’ve stated it, I think there’s no reason to follow through",neg,train
But I may guess given the tax benefit just rough math I guess around 25 million a year,neg,train
"I guess that’s -- we read that to be the percentage of dividends and share repo, it’s just a greater -- well a greater number of the higher earning level",neg,train
Or is there any thoughts on changing on if fringes anything from capital deployment?,neg,train
And you mentioned that drop of 300 million up at 1,neg,train
So it’s certainly up to 1% that’s gone up sharply,neg,train
Our net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 2,neg,train
"98%, up 6 basis points from the third quarter and up 15 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
"As a result of the tax reform bill, we expect our net interest margin this year to be negatively affected by approximately 4 basis points due to the revisions in the tax equivalent adjustment",neg,train
However this will have no impact on our net interest income,neg,train
And do you have just the September balance on your total public funds?,neg,test
Net income for the fourth quarter was $43 million or $1,neg,train
Our return on assets during the fourth quarter was 1%,neg,train
Tourism in Hawaii also remains strong with visitor spending increasing 6,neg,train
6% in the first 11 months of 2017 compared with the same period in 2016,neg,train
The growth of spending as a result of a 4,neg,train
8% in average daily spending driven mostly by domestic visitor spend,neg,train
"4 billion, of which just over 800 million are time",neg,train
And then we are accruing our value share for our broad employee base at the new tax number,neg,train
"So, all-in-all, that’s call it $3 million that’s coming about as a result of the tax change",neg,test
"Just as an asterisk, on the executive compensation plans, we have not made any adjustments to those plan as a result of the tax change",neg,test
I’d like to thank everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Bank of Hawaii,neg,train
"As always feel free to contact me, if you have additional questions or need any further clarification on any of the topics discussed today",neg,test
"So I just wanted to follow up, if you can talk about the margin outlook",neg,train
"So I guess, we see the margin reset about 294 because of the tax change in 1Q? Given sort of your expectation for run-off in time deposits, this should be margin accretive I would assume, and the benefit of the December rate hike being like where do you think the margin lands when you think about first quarter? And from there on, how do you view your rate sensitivity to every additional Fed rate hike?",neg,test
Wanted to touch on loan growth I guess starting off,neg,train
"What’s the expectation for this year or are we moderating from that 9%? And I guess more specifically on the construction book, is there -- what kind of -- what magnitude of run off is still remaining?",neg,train
And our next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin of Piper Jaffray,neg,train
"Last call you talked a little bit about kind of going after “Your share, market share of retail CDs”",neg,train
Is it your expectation at this point given that you’re kind of letting some of the public CDs run-off to go after more continuous to go after time deposits on the retail side?,neg,train
I'll now ask Dean to provide you with some additional details on our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for 2018,neg,train
Mary will then make some comments on our credit quality,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Keating of Barclays,neg,train
2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter up slightly from the previous quarter and up from the same quarter of 2016,neg,train
"At the end of the fourth quarter, our Tier 1 capital ratio was 13",neg,train
"1 million or 51% of net income in dividends and repurchased 128,600 shares of common stock for a total of $10",neg,train
"We repurchased an additional 19,500 shares between January 2 and January 19, at a total cost of $1",neg,train
Growth in non-interest income will continue to be a challenge this year due to the downward trend and overdraft fees and our expectation for lower volumes of salable mortgages,neg,train
"So, the Q2 number and Q4 if you analyse that, that would be the expected cost to carry the shares",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point,neg,train
"As Mary will discuss later, we've recorded a credit provision of $4",neg,train
"9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $42",neg,train
The decline compared to the previous quarter was largely due to lower mortgage banking income,neg,train
Compared with the previous year the decrease was largely due to lower mortgage banking income and lower revenue from the customer derivative program,neg,train
"Sales of single-family homes on Oahu, our primary market, increased 6",neg,train
The medium price of single-family homes on Oahu increased 2,neg,train
"There're times where the earnings are a little higher, a little lower for some reason and it moves around from 45 to 65 somewhere",neg,train
But I would say Matt anywhere from 50% to 60% range is ultimately where we would like to maintain our focus in terms of that dividend payout ratio,neg,train
Our net charge off and delinquency results in this portfolio continue to be very good and consistent with the last several years,neg,train
"As Mark mentioned, business loans were down for the second consecutive quarter, reflective of the number of outside unscheduled pay-offs, modest demand characteristics and the continuation of very competitive market dynamics",neg,train
"Quarter-end investment securities were down modestly from the end of second and third quarters, but up almost $300 million from the end of fourth quarter of last year, a result of the Merchants acquisition",neg,train
"Matt, if you look at the detail for us, I would tell you that there is some positive improvement in yields associated with auto lending for sure",neg,train
"And I think as we mentioned, we took a little bit of a step back in certain lines of business or in certain asset classes within indirect auto, principally and interestingly enough, new car lending where the rates and the balance of the risk and return did not make a lot of sense",neg,train
And in our marketplace since you have a severe absence of public transportation that tends to work pretty well,neg,train
And then just a final question for me with respect to capital deployments,neg,train
"Clearly, with the lower effective tax rate, you'll be accreting capital at a faster pace in 2018 and beyond",neg,train
"Does that change your outlook for how you use capital? Does M&A, for example, become more of a requirement into 2018, 2019, and does that in turn change the criteria of what kind of deals you guys would look at?",neg,train
We will be accreting capital at a more rapid pace in 2018 than we have in the past,neg,train
"I don't think it's going to impact the disciplined and strategic thinking we applied to M&A, which is really around identifying and executing quality merger and acquisition opportunities that can help us model our earnings and our dividends in a sustainable fashion",neg,train
"And maybe as you know, we talked for a couple of years about effectively accumulated a fair bit of capital",neg,train
"So I will start with this comment, as the fourth quarter was roughly $3 million higher than the third quarter",neg,train
I would argue that’s a little bit more than half of net variable or variation from the quarter was actually something that we don’t have in our recurring run rate,neg,train
We have handful of costs associated with some competitive needs for some technology and system related initiatives,neg,train
"We had a little bit higher cost in the repair and maintenance side of our physical infrastructure, because we were so busy with the Merchants’ integration in the second and third quarter, we get a little bit of latent demand there, that we probably took care of in the fourth quarter from a facility standpoint",neg,train
"8% from the fourth quarter of last year, reflective of the Merchants’ transaction and several core improvement initiatives",neg,test
"On a linked quarter basis, banking non-interest income was down $800,000 from the third quarter, which included our annual dividend from certain pooled group insurance programs",neg,train
And we'll take our next question from Collyn Gilbert with KBW,neg,train
"Nothing further to say, other than thank you all for joining the call and we look forward to talking again in April",neg,train
And then what's the normal or typical run-off that you see in the muni book on a quarterly basis?,neg,train
"And then just finally, Scott, on operating expenses and I apologize if you said this in your opening comments",neg,train
"37 billion for the fourth quarter were up 22% in fourth quarter of 2016, reflective of the mid second quarter acquisition of Merchants",neg,train
"On a year-over-year basis, residential mortgages and home equity instruments grew 1",neg,train
7% organically as the company continues to sell most of its longer term secondary market eligible originations,neg,train
Consumer indirect loans were down $33 million in 2017 or 3,neg,train
"So I think that we're pretty well positioned here, the capital accumulation is going to help",neg,train
We improved our operating efficiency from last year over this year,neg,train
"And with the lower tax rate in higher earnings and higher capital accumulation, I think we have a lot of options the earnings momentum is great, the margin and maintenance, I think we've got that pretty well enhanced, our non-banking businesses continue to just excel in terms of their performance",neg,train
So I think we’re pretty well position going into 2018,neg,train
"And then just a modeling question, Scott, the tax rate of 22% to 23% that you project for 2018",neg,train
Is that include the share based comp adjustment that you expect to see probably the bulk of which in the first quarter?,neg,train
And then given the shape of the yield curve and some of the changes between September and now we've seen a lot of upward momentum on the yields,neg,train
"Where is that translated into higher asset yield on your side? And then conversely, where is some of that being competed away more heavily?",neg,train
I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark for any additional or closing remarks,neg,train
"Maybe could you guys talk a little bit about just your growth outlook and what you're seeing in the markets? I know you'd indicated in the opening comments, competitive landscapes as it relates to lending",neg,train
But just talk a little bit more about that and maybe how you see loan growth shaping out on an organic basis in 2018,neg,train
"Right now, we're sitting at a record pipeline in our commercial business, but we also expect and we had some poor visibility in the past and we expect more and some larger pay-offs to happen in the first half of 2018",neg,train
"As I said, we do have a record pipeline right now",neg,train
"The insurance companies and the kind have gotten back into the commercial lending, they're doing 30 year non- recourse financing",neg,train
"And you have our commercial customer with a nice project that cash flows well, and we're not going to compete with that",neg,train
I think the competitiveness in the market is probably more around rate and turn than anything else,neg,train
So we're seeing really low spreads and we do not manage the volume,neg,train
"We run our business based on profitability and return on equity characteristics, but not on volume",neg,train
"On the retail banking side, deposit growth is in average",neg,train
We took out a fair bit more municipal business with the Merchants transaction and that tends to be a little bit more volatile just in terms of quarter-to-quarter swing,neg,train
But we've always had low single digit deposit growth in our market,neg,train
"We actually had really good -- despite the fact that we had negative commercial growth, our deposit growth in the commercial portfolio, I don't remember exactly, Scott, if it’s 4%, 5% or 6%, something like that, deposit growth for business customers",neg,train
"So with the function of -- with the customers, it was a function of the pay downs that really worked the debt side",neg,train
And we’ll take our next question from Matthew Breese with Piper Jaffray,neg,train
We had some outsized option exercise activity in the first quarter last year when we were trading north of $60,neg,train
"Well, people have the same motivation at our current trading levels? Too early to tell on that",neg,train
But I would suspect to see a little activity than last year's first quarter,neg,train
But you're probably not far off by thinking we're at the lower end of blended rate earlier in the year,neg,train
I think as you know when you operate in lower growth markets we've never had double digit market opportunities,neg,train
"In fact, it’s mid single digits, which sometimes we've been at and other times, we haven't depending on market demand",neg,test
"Right now, I would -- if you look at the three main portfolios in the commercial, we had record originations in 2017, excluding Merchants",neg,train
But we also had an incredible level of unexpected pay-offs,neg,train
"So despite the fact that we have otherwise great year in terms of business lending, get over $100 million, those are the larger ones in unexpected pay-off",neg,train
So that certainly impacted what would otherwise have been a very solid year,neg,train
"You're not quite as I say deliverable on the insurance and the wealth management side, but still very, very acceptable",neg,train
"Internally, we do look at the core efficiency ratio of the core bank differently than we look at the efficiency ratio of the non-banking businesses",neg,train
Thank you [Operator Instructions] First question from Alex Twerdahl with Sandler O’Neill,neg,train
Is there any way we could may be measure that in terms of efficiency,neg,train
I think overall despite the fact that approximately $6 million we're going to hit next year,neg,train
So I think we've gotten some plans in terms of the retail business,neg,train
I mean if you look at -- I don't know how many times I've gotten end of the year and said we had double digit growth in the top and bottom lines in our non-banking businesses,neg,train
"But our benefits business tremendous year, same with wealth and benefits, double digits top line, double digits bottom line",neg,train
"The margins of every one of those businesses went up, so they've been highly additive to overall operating results over the last few years, and I expect that to continue",neg,train
I expect 2018 is going to again be a really very strong year for all three of our non-banking businesses,neg,train
"To come back to your question, I think we still will get asset yield acceleration into 2018",neg,test
"The question is, are we going to be forced from a market dynamic to match up with the piece of that on the rate side",neg,train
I like our starting point as well as anybody’s in the industry in terms of the absolute,neg,train
"But that being said, there is another rate change late in the first quarter, does that generate a little bit more market activity from competitive standpoint in our markets probably",neg,train
"But to Mark's point, you’re probably not going to see it in our markets; first, as you know, our markets tend to be sort of a six to 12 month lag from the rest of the broader market",neg,train
So I think you’ll hear more from folks in Northern New Jersey or Boston or the Carolina's from the standpoint and the demographic than you will from us early,neg,train
"Would we be satisfied with a flat margin in 2018, probably, but at the same point in time, we love the benefit modestly from a little bit of pick up",neg,train
And then just to frame some of that the FRB dividend,neg,train
So can you remind us what it was for the full year 2017? I know you had said that you expect '18 to be a third of that level,neg,train
"But it would be fair to say the first quarter might be closer to that -- maybe 21% of 22% and then go a little bit higher in the second, third, and fourth, just because of that share based comp adjustment?",neg,train
"44 billion year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2017, also reflective of the Merchants transaction and continued success in our core deposit gatherer",neg,train
"We ended the quarter with $363 million of borrowings, of which $337 million were collateralized customer repurchase agreements, which act like and are priced much more like deposits than wholesale borrowings",neg,train
"So I think as the spreads have gotten lower and the terms have gotten longer, that's what from our perspective, is the principal competitive dynamics of the commercial market",neg,test
"It’s not really so much demand as much as it is other participants taking out credit relationships, not other banks by enlarge, but non-bank participants in the markets",neg,train
"And I think I said this last quarter, but prices are high right now",neg,train
Cap rates are low and there’s a lot of transactions going on in terms of asset sales,neg,test
"But if you put all those together, it’s probably less about average demand than it is about the competitive environment and the early pay-offs because of asset prices",neg,train
And then obviously limited activity in terms of M&A across upstate in New York for a variety of reasons,neg,train
"Guys, for the targets of size that are still out there, does the pick-up in the activity economically these last two years",neg,train
"Quarterly revenues from our benefits administration, wealth management and insurance businesses of $34",neg,train
"4 million from the fourth quarter of last year and included the NRS and Merchants transactions, as well as three smaller insurance agency acquisitions completed earlier in 2017",neg,train
"I would say the standards have held reasonably well, Joe",neg,test
I’d say better than the last big up cycle where you saw lot of the structure deterioration,neg,train
And I don’t see a lot of banks doing that as well,neg,train
"I think the things that we see where there is anything, if you want to call stretching going on, is some of the [AMs] have stretched a little bit where you normally do something on a 10 year basis, somebody is wanting to go 20, and the spreads [effect]",neg,train
We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect,neg,train
"Despite the large partial charge-offs on the one specific commercial relationship previously mentioned, 2017 net charge-offs results were again manageable and we do not keep signs of additional asset quality headwinds on the horizon",neg,train
"Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining our Q4 and full year conference call",neg,train
"We had a strong fourth quarter, it was up 10% per share on an operating basis over 2016, but was down in Q3 due to $0",neg,train
05 per share credit provision related to a single acquired loan that Scott will discuss further,neg,train
"Now 2017 was the year where we used a bunch of capital in the NRS transaction to really jumpstart that business, and essentially to buy business that we had not participated in core in terms of product and service mix",neg,train
"But outside of that, with a little bit of operating improvement, you are capital returning enterprise from that point forward, even if your growth rate is in mid single digits",neg,train
"As far as a targeted payout ratio, we don't really have one that’s formal",neg,train
I think we like to keep it in between the 50% to 60% range,neg,train
"As you know, our organic growth is at best a low to mid single digit number that does not require an enormous amount of our capital to provide organic growth",neg,train
So we are going to be accumulating capital regardless of the tax rate change as we have historically,neg,train
I think we like to keep it in the 50% to 60% range somewhere,neg,train
"I think we will have a good year in commercial in 2018, regardless the impact of the early pay-offs",neg,train
"And as I said, we were aware of the plans with larger ones in the first half",neg,train
I’ll expect our originations in 2018 to be very strong in the commercial business,neg,train
So it's really a function of what happens with those early pay-offs,neg,train
The mortgage business will be fine as it always has been,neg,train
The auto business will probably decline a bit further in terms of outstanding volumes,neg,train
"I think as everyone knows, the auto business is in like year ten of the cycle and that's a very cyclical business",neg,train
"With that said, the margin on that business will be higher in 2018 than it will be in 2017",neg,train
76% of total outstanding with the addition of the acquired Merchants' loans earlier in 2017,neg,train
"Based on the most recent trailing four quarters' results, which include the large single charge-off previously mentioned, our reserves still represent 4",neg,train
"Despite multiple reports of macro level auto industry concerns, our 2017 net charge-off ratio without our lending portfolio was under 40 basis points of average loans, consistent with the previous eight quarters and still quite productive by longer term historical standards",neg,train
"Again, just for you Collyn and the rest of the group as a reminder, the first quarter is our low quarter of the year where we have some seasonality",neg,train
"We typically have a cent to a cent and half more in payroll tax expenses, because we're so early in the payroll a year, a cent to a cent and a quarter more in utility and maintenance cost for petrol related activity",neg,train
And as we typically are a cent to a cent and a quarter lower on making non-interest income from lower account utilization characteristics,neg,train
"Now we’re doing our best and a bunch of initiatives trying to offset some of that in preparation for the Durbin, but no guarantees that we’ll deliver on that in the first fiscal quarter of ‘18",neg,train
So hope it helps you little bit with run rate,neg,train
And we'll take our next question from Russell Gunther with D,neg,train
Our operating effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 28,neg,train
"4% in last year’s fourth quarter and included $300,000 reduction in income tax expense related to the change in accounting for share-based transaction",neg,train
Our quarterly and full year 2017 effective tax rate included the incurrence of almost $26 million of acquisition expenses during 2017,neg,test
"And that’s more than an episodic conclusion on our behalf, and it probably represents in some cases as Mark mentioned, prices were rigid not participatory",neg,train
"If somebody is getting funding from the outside on 25 or 30 years basis at fixed rate outcomes, that's probably not going to be our sweet spot",neg,train
"On the investment portfolio side, Matt, nothing much yet but again, we've had really modest reinvestment in cash flows",neg,train
So I don’t know that we could pick it up on that anyway,neg,train
"I think, as you know, there is only so many things left in upstate New York is that really over the banks in terms of concentration",neg,train
"We have our presence in New England, which I would arguably not a big stretch for us",neg,train
"I mean our closest branch to their closest branch was six miles and other than Lake Champlain, which is in the middle where there is actually contiguous markets, which is I think really along the lines of what we would look to continue to do in the future, we clearly can't go north",neg,train
"(NYSE:CBU) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 22, 2018 11:00 AM ET",neg,train
"It's just really a function of those unscheduled pay-offs, which are difficult to predict",neg,test
"But right now, as I said, the pipeline is really good and we had record originations last year",neg,train
And so I would expect we’ll have a good origination here in 2018 as well,neg,train
"It will really be a function in terms of both actionable growth in the portfolio, it will be a function of level of those unscheduled pay-offs",neg,train
We will have a significant tax rate benefit going forward that Scott will discuss further,neg,train
"Shifting to the income statement, our reported net interest margin for the fourth quarter was 3",neg,train
"74%, which was down 2 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016 and 10 basis points higher than the linked third quarter of 2017, consistent with historical results in the second and fourth quarters each year include our semiannual dividend from the Federal Reserve Bank of approximately $750,000, which added 3 basis points of net interest margin to fourth quarter results",neg,train
"So that's what really I meant by that, more of a managed, because when you issue 100% stock you’re really -- you're financing all -- the entire premium and goodwill and intangibles",neg,train
"So you get -- I mean it affects your tangible differently than your tier 1 but our focus is not as much as intangible as it is over time, gap in cash returns per share in the way you manage that, the way we mange it in terms of M&A and try to use an appropriate mix of cash and stock in our transactions",neg,train
"But the market prices haven't really declined, because that market really is not made up of corporate buyers, is made up of individual buyers who are still in the 37% tax bracket",neg,train
"So the pricing is still recently good in that market, yet the benefit to us upholding those is deteriorated somewhat",neg,train
"9 million above the fourth quarter of 2016 and included the operating activities from both the Merchants and NRS transaction, as well as the significantly higher intangible amortization that resulted from the two acquisitions",neg,train

"And the payment schedule is still the same, that doesn’t change?",neg,train
"Non-performing loans, comprised of both legacy and acquired loans, ended the fourth quarter of 2017 at $27",neg,train
"44% of total loans, 7 basis points higher than the ratio reported at the end of September and reflective of the remaining non-accrual balance on the previously mentioned commercial credit",neg,train
"Our core operating net interest margin has remained in a fairly narrow band over the last several quarters, a range we would expect to continue to operate in for, at least, the next few quarters, including the impact of higher purchase loan accretion related to the Merchants transaction",neg,train
"However, the change in the federal tax rate in 2018 will result in lower fully taxable equivalent yields on our municipal investment and loan portfolios",neg,train
"And although, the change will not impact to report that their interest income, we estimate it will lower 2018 net interest margin by 6 basis points to 8 basis points compared to 2017",neg,train
"We tried to deploy a lot of that with both NRS, which was 50-50 mix and with Merchants, which was a 70-30 mix",neg,test
"But I would say that the fact that we’re accumulating capital quicker does not do anything in terms of impacting our strategic thinking, but it would impact our capacity to deploy more capital in terms of mix that creates even stronger earnings accretion at any given transactions, but I think they’ll ultimately be a benefit there",neg,train

And we'll take our last question from Joe Fenech with Hovde Group,neg,train
"And then just final question back, Mark, you had mentioned in the discussion about capital usage as you guys accrete capital more in ’18",neg,train
And I'm trying to find exactly how you worded it,neg,train
Can you just talk about what did you mean by that?,neg,train
"So probably from an organic standpoint, Matt, mid single digits would maybe a little bit of a pick-up higher because we're getting full year impact in a couple of those spots",neg,train
"But again, those are businesses that we really like right now",neg,train
"And I think we said this before, because we’ve got to a critical mass size in each and every one of them, we now have good operating leverage characteristics in terms of our growth",neg,test
"As a post to somebody who is brand new in one of those non-banking business lines, sometimes you have to suffer through and so you get to a certain level of critical mass, you don’t improve your outcome",neg,train
"But both in terms of business developments, distribution underlying operation, very, very sound and strong business for us at this point in time, all of which we believe are investible on both organic and an acquired basis",neg,train
Do you anticipate that you will continue to place the emphasis on munis in the investment portfolio in the new tax environment? Or do you think there could be other types of securities that become more investible from both the risk and tax adjusted yield standpoint?,neg,train
I would argue that that’s the most high value thing you can do with bank is attract core deposits,neg,test
"I think it's probably -- as you know, when you establish an effective rate, you establish it in the early near for the full year outcome",neg,train
So the fact that you may have more activity on the share based side early in the year in theory prognosticate that,neg,train
"As a quick reminder we probably do have more tax exempts income than many of our peers, because of the size of our municipal securities portfolio",neg,train
The other thing to remember is the base in 2017 was a little bit artificially low than 29,neg,train
"5% because we did have $26 million of acquisition expense and we don’t expect to incur in 2018, so you’re starting at a little higher level there",neg,train
So a handful of things that play into that region,neg,test
And we’ll take our next question from Jake Civiello with RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
I’ll now turn this back over to Ashley to open the line for any questions,neg,train
And then does the potential for a higher interest rate environment in 2018 change how you think about M&A and the value of core deposits as potential acquisition targets?,neg,train
"Again, it’s a little hard to find these in the segment disclosures that we do, but you can get close",neg,train
"I would argue if you blended those businesses together, you get to a margin outcome of roughly 30%, maybe you touch higher in 2017, which means the inverse of that is the efficiency ratio, so you're in the high 60s in terms of efficiency ratio",neg,train
"Clearly, the transactions that we have completed on the benefit side improvement in those businesses from an operational standpoint, it has led to an outcome that is not hurting our blended effective efficiency ratio",neg,test
"On the other side, multiples have increased a bit in terms of market multiples, as well as M&A multiples",neg,train
Our full year effective tax rate in 2017 was 29,neg,train
5% excluding the one-time gain from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,neg,train
"With the lower and active federal tax rate, we expect our 2018 full year effective rate to decline to between 22% and 23% based on our current mix of income from tax exempts versus fully taxable sources",neg,train
We continue to expect a net reduction from Durbin mandated impacts on debit interchange revenues beginning in July of 2018 of approximately $12 million annually or estimated $6 million in the second half of 2018,neg,train
"Mortgage side, still rates are better than they were a year ago and better than they were a year before that in terms of composite rates",neg,train
We're portfolio-ing 15 year products and below that may or may not be characteristics of secondary eligible,neg,train
"But we think that the average life of those products in our marketplace is in that eight to nine year total outcome, and we're happy with that on the balance sheet; so selling most of our longer term originations, because that's probably still the right thing to do in this interest rate environment in terms of durations and tenure",neg,train
"And I think -- and back to your question, in the commercial side, some of that opportunity to price things up is probably being competed away there",neg,train
"So as much as you may see a little bit higher asset yields on the business lending side, spread don’t look like they have widened through the end of 2017",neg,train
The tier one leverage ratio was 10% at year-end and tangible equity to net tangible assets ended December at 8,neg,train
61% despite the meaningful use of capital for both the NRS and Merchants’ transactions during the year,neg,train
"As we had consistently discussed, and primarily due to our history of acquisitions, the company has vetted a net deferred tax liability position for several years",neg,train
"As such, the required revaluation of those net deferred tax liabilities, following the late December enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will lower the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulted in a one-time gain to the Company of $38 million, which was reflected in our fourth quarter 2017 GAAP results",neg,train
4 million of deferred tax liabilities generated from certain acquired intangible assets or $0,neg,train
"And I guess that ties to the next question just on the margin, which could have been margin came in better than what we were looking for",neg,train
I recognize the FRB dividend and obviously the accretion income,neg,train
"But in total, and I understand your comments on that deposit data is likely to go -- move higher in '18",neg,test
"But how are you thinking about the margin? I mean if there is increased discipline around profitability, do we see maybe better NIM results in '18 than perhaps what we saw in '17, or are you trying to just control compression? Or how should we think about the margin?",neg,train
"We completed our build out of DFAST, improved our risk management processes and systems, and implemented improved customer channel technology",neg,train
"In summary, it was a transformative year for Community Bank System, and I could not be more proud of our 2,600 team members for what they accomplished",neg,train
"Yes, I think you hit it right on the head",neg,train
I think there will be other instruments that will become more attractive any time it gets 40% drop in the moving tax equivalent adjustment,neg,train
It will probably take some market a little bit of time to react to that,neg,test
"But actually for us in mortgage back securities, something we really has not invested in in a significant way in number of years",neg,train
"But really on point question, Jake, I think that will give you the result",neg,train
"On a linked quarter basis, operating expenses were up $2",neg,test
"9 million from the third quarter and included incremental 650,000 of salaries and benefits cost, primarily performance based",neg,train
"8 million higher with more than half of that in higher professional services cost for certain technology and core systems initiatives, as well as some additional DFAST related costs",neg,train
We also incurred higher marketing and employee training costs in some of our newer markets in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"So we were about $600,000 for the second quarter and then up through about $750,000 in the fourth quarter, because so we were larger banks for FRB purposes",neg,train
"So instead of a roughly 6% dividend yield from the Federal Reserve, we got closer to 2%",neg,train
"3 million or probably looking at $455,000 we expect in dividends for 2018",neg,train
"In the mortgage business, I think our mortgage and home equity business year-over-year was up about 2%, that's not a typical for us, pretty consistent low single digit market growth in mortgages",neg,train
"And we talked about the auto book a little bit last quarter, year-over-year it was down I think 3%, it's actually down less than what we thought it was going to be, because we did make some strategic moves in that business to trade off volume for returns",neg,train
"In fact, the portfolio yield in the auto book is actually up 24 basis points over the last two quarters, so a pretty significant move in the yield and the market in that business, but we traded off some volume",neg,train
"So I do think M&A activity I think I'm not mistaken the volume was off in '17 compared to '16, not for us I mean industry wide",neg,train
"I think as long as there is a lot of economic growth and earnings are growing for these banks that might be thinking about the strategic transaction, I think they hold off",neg,train
"So I think the fact that the strong economy creates growing earnings and operating performance, I think there is no reason necessarily to think about a strategic transaction",neg,train
"I think generally, we would certainly welcome the outcome we've got in the fourth quarter, which was a combination of slightly higher asset yields based on new originations in virtually all of our three major portfolios, and not being up at all by funding cost",neg,train
"As a matter of fact, we actually had a very, very efficient balance sheet in the fourth quarter in terms of very, very much levels of overnight borrowings on a net basis",neg,train
"And part to that prefaces to [indiscernible] part of that was, if you look at our deposit balances from the end of June to the end of the year and it looks like we dropped deposits from about $180 million, $115 million of those will be placed or put into commercial and municipal repurchase agreements, which as I mentioned, price more like the deposit, a little higher than deposit, but generally closer to a deposit than an overnight institutional wholesale rate, so very efficient outcome from that",neg,test
Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in these statements,neg,train
"Mark, just building on some of your very positive commentary on the non-banking front, also very strong 2017",neg,train
What do you think the growth outlook for 2018 is for those items?,neg,train
"And Matt to your question, we are essentially expecting $0",neg,train
"07 of GAAP expense on amortization intangible assets, which is likely to be very close to the same number for quarter in 2018 as it was in '17, just given the timing of our last two transactions, last two major transactions",neg,train
"So to Mark's point is that whole 50% to 60% both general policy guidelines for us, we'll do that both on a cash earnings as well as the GAAP earnings",neg,train
"And then at the same point, I'm always trying to look out what else could you use that incremental capital for, if you didn't put it into dividend capacity",neg,train
I think the spreads have gotten -- I mean the events than for sometime but they've gotten there but those are the only two areas,neg,train
And I don’t think you’re seeing a lot of wholesale deterioration in credit structure that really speaks to safety and soundness necessarily in terms of credit,neg,train
I would -- from my advantage point it's mainly term extension and thinner spreads,neg,test
"And I think that’s expecting double-digits in our revenue and margin improvements or earnings improvement, it's probably not the target at this current time, look we’d like to see that",neg,train
I think in those businesses we’re thinking about mid single digit growth rate with continued operating leverage performance,neg,train
"The path for us has been relatively simple for all of our businesses but grow revenues faster than you grow expenses using, if this happened",neg,train
"I mean you have -- we will pick up one conditional month of revenues from the NRS transaction, remember we acquired that February of last year",neg,train
"So we get little bit of a lift on the wealth management side, because the Merchants’ trust business came to us in May of last year",neg,train
So I would take the third quarter run rate and add about half of that and variation we had in the fourth quarter as the trend rate going into the first quarter of 2018,neg,train
"We're modeling about 3% to 4% growth in salaries and benefit cost going into 2018, principally merit in nature",neg,train
But I think there are certain positions like I think most of the people and in free world are seeing,neg,train
"Again, there’s a little bit of wage pressure in certain skilled level positions",neg,train
So we were trying to leave ourselves the opportunity to react to that,neg,train
I would be curious though for an update on the Merchants’ footprints,neg,train
What are some of the dynamics going on in that market and your loan growth expectations there?,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
"On a full year basis, operating earnings were up 13% over 2016",neg,test
"This performance was attributable to a number of factors, including the accretive benefit of the NRS acquisition in Q1 and the Merchants merger in Q2",neg,train
"In addition, our benefits, wealth management and insurance businesses all delivered double-digit growth on both the top end bottom line and improved margins",neg,test
Banking fee income was up double-digit as well and our efficiency ratio improved from 59,neg,train
"1 million of incremental purchase loan accretion compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which added an additional 5 basis points to our net interest margin",neg,train
"Proactive and disciplined management of funding costs continued our positive effect on margin results as total deposit costs from the quarter remained at 10 basis points, including the added deposits from the Merchants’ transaction",neg,train
Despite four Fed funds rate changes since December of 2016 our deposit beta has remained at zero over the last 12 months,neg,train
"As of December 31st, our investment portfolio stood at $3",neg,train
08 billion and was comprised of $590 million of U,neg,train
"agency and agency backed mortgage obligations, or 19% of the total; $502 million of municipal bonds or [15%] and $1",neg,test
The remaining 3% was in corporate and other debt securities,neg,train
The portfolio contained net unrealized gains of $23 million as of year-end compared to a net unrealized gain of $42 million at the end of December of 2016 due to the movement up in market interest rates during the last 12 months,neg,train
So I think as you know banks aren't really bought as much as they are sold,neg,train
I mean it's not going to prevent us from understanding and identifying those high value targets and then having dialogues with them,neg,train
"But certainly the multiples have gone up, not just in the market but in the M&A space as well, that can make a difference in terms of whether a transacting can get done or not relative to the sellers’ expectation",neg,test
So that could be another challenge or hurdle that we need to face in this environment,neg,train
"So that’s certainly part of it, but the overall strategy is not necessarily as much around interest rates or solely core deposit quality, it's really a function of the entire qualitative and economic aspect of a potential opportunity, ultimately focusing on what's the accretion on both a GAAP and cash per share basis over time, and is that sustainable or is it a quality expense in our organization",neg,train
"So I mean all those things certainly play a role, but they’re not just positive in terms of the ultimate judgments we make around M&A",neg,train
"At this time, I would turn the conference over to Mark Tryniski, President and Chief Executive Officer",neg,train
And then my last question is really in terms of capital deployment,neg,train
"Obviously, the tax rate helps dividend capacity and then we are amortizing quite a bit of an intangible",neg,train
"So I just wanted to get a sense for if there is a targeted payout ratio, what it is and is it more or less based on cash earnings or GAAP earnings? Just help me frame where that could be heading",neg,train
"I'll start with the fact that we've increased the dividend every year for the past 25 years, which is a dynamic I like, because it puts pressure on us to continue to grow earnings",neg,test
So I kind of like that dynamic and that pressure,neg,train
We certainly have significant capacity right now to continue to raise the dividend,neg,train
So probably in the $80 million to $90 million range in terms of cash flow expectation,neg,train
"Hundreds, literally several hundreds of CUSIPs in that portfolio, probably not that big of a surprise given the market that we participate in, as well as what we buy for things out of the market",neg,train
"But generally speaking, we think that's a pretty productive outcome",neg,train
"In 2017, we did not redeployed our investment capital on a full basis but in fact most of our investment purchases in 2017 work for CRA related activities",neg,train
And most of those are agency backed mortgage back securities or flow with some type,neg,train
Early in 2018 is probably still going to be the answer,neg,train
And then the jury is out and we actually have a couple of more rate increases,neg,train
And get a little bit of upward inflection on yield curve that would be highly productive for us,neg,train
"As Mark noted the fourth quarter 2017 was noted very solid operating quarter for us; and as a reminder, included the activities of the Northeast Retirement Services acquisition that we completed in early February 2017 and the Merchants Bancshares acquisition completed last May",neg,test
"First off, I think it's remarkable that five rate hikes later your cost to deposits has been unchanged completely at 10 basis points, which is amongst the lowest in industry",neg,train
"How long do you think you can keep that up? I mean, are you getting some pressure from different customers, the different pockets to raise deposit cost?",neg,train
And welcome to this Community Bank System Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Earnings Conference Call,neg,train
"Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the industry, markets, and economic environment in which the Company operates",neg,test
"We started to see that in the end of the third quarter, mainly at the higher level of balances customer who have more meaningful balances looking at other alternative",neg,train
So I would suspect our deposit data for 2018 will not be zero,neg,train
"I think if you look at the markets that we operate and we've always had somewhat lower deposit funding cost and would expect that will continue into 2018, I just believe that we will experience some modest break pressure competitively in the market in 2018",neg,train
We’ve spent a lot of time understanding the market and understanding how we can optimize our funding cost,neg,train
"And then just last one for me, Mark, a little bit more of a big picture",neg,train
But you expressed a great degree of optimism for 2018,neg,train
"And I'd just be curious as to what part of your business do you think you're most optimistic about, what are the dynamics going on there",neg,train
"We’re a few years now into this initiative by New York State, as you know though, to invest substantial dollars across the region",neg,train
"Seems like there's been a substantial benefit, certainly more activity, appreciate you guys aren't quite as active in some of the larger metro markets as some of your peers",neg,test
"Were you seeing some stretching, would you say, at the margins in terms of underwriting maybe some peers doing some things that make you raise an eyebrow or have the standards held for the most part from what you're seeing?",neg,train
"As you know, we effected the transaction in May, in the second quarter",neg,train
We have had sum that run off in the Merchants’ portfolio for couple of reasons,neg,train
"One is that and I can't remember if we talked about this last quarter, and I'll repeat it",neg,train
"Before the May merger, they had essentially pushed through almost the entirety of their pipeline to the closing process before we closed to avoid any disruptions to customers during the transition",neg,train
"Now, that brought with it a higher balance sheet from us, which was our advantage of course but it left them with almost no pipeline",neg,train
"So they spent the last seven months rebuilding that pipeline, which they have to a large degree",neg,train
"So we had net run off at Merchants, which we expected frankly over the six or seven months",neg,train
"I would say at this point, most of that is for us",neg,train
But those markets are on average more active than ours in terms of economic demand and growth characteristics,neg,train
So we're looking forward to resumption of net growth in the Merchants portfolio in 2018,neg,train
But we did get some run off that we expected in the third and fourth quarters of the Merchants portfolio,neg,train
"Despite volume challenges, aggregate margin dollars were at a record level due to new originations and higher yields the contractual and prepayment cash flows for both the consumer and business portfolios, adding to the margin was a deposit made in 2017 of zero",neg,train
"But the markets and the multiples that goes up then it goes down and over time, it doesn’t really change our strategic thinking around acquiring high value partners that can help us sustainably grow our earnings per share and our cash flow per share",neg,train
"The fourth quarter and full year of 2017 was a continuation of the favorable overall asset quality results we have experienced for several years, despite $3",neg,train
"Including this one large charge-off, full year net charge-offs were $10",neg,train
"Well, if you -- in terms of capital, we really managed tier one leverage, which is where for us all the other risk based ratios were 2x, the requirements",neg,train
"The one that’s closest to us, if you will, for us is the tier 1 leverage ratio right now at 10% and the minimum is 6%, but we probably would have run that",neg,train
We have a fair bit of certain amount of capital that we can deploy,neg,train
"And M&A, if you do 100% stock deal, you're not really using that capital the way you use the capital and effectively reduce your tier 1 leverage ratio is to use a cash stock mix",neg,train
"So the more cash you use, the lower you're going to -- the more of your tier 1 surplus you're going to utilize",neg,train
"We completed a strategic acquisition that enhances our position in Napa, as well as the Wine sector, and we did all that while continuing to deliver strong financial results",neg,train
"Russ, I may have missed your – as you list the final loan and deposit totals from Bank of Napa, do you have those available?",neg,train
"Last year, we enhanced our market division through the acquisition of Bank of Napa, expanded our presence in Sonoma County by opening [indiscernible], and our Oakland commercial banking team created real momentum in the very lucrative East Bay market",neg,train
"So, there may be a little bit more, but we evaluate the portfolio on an ongoing basis, and we're looking for upcoming changes, not only with regard to changes in credit on any one of -- any security in our portfolio, but also what the tax law ramifications, their impacts will be on the portfolio",neg,train

Non-interest-bearing deposits increased by $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and comprised 47% of total deposits by year-end,neg,train
"9 million in loans acquired from Bank of Napa, total loans increased 12",neg,test
New loans in the fourth quarter were approximately $51 million compared to $42 million in the third quarter and $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"And just one quick one, and I apologize if I missed it in your comments, I jumped on a little late",neg,train
"Since 2018, we have our own guesstimate, curious what you guys think it will shake out at?",neg,train
So somewhat similar to the previous question on just the data processing and professional service costs that came in around $2 million and $1 million in total for the quarter,neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Tim O'Brien with Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
"We also made some strategic hiring, including Jim Kimball, Scott McAdams and open an office in Hillsburg [ph]",neg,train
They really don't utilize a lot of capital to create more capital,neg,train
Non-interest income in the fourth quarter was $2 million compared to $2,neg,train
"2016 benefited from a $347,000 special dividend from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and in 2017, we recorded net losses of 195,000 on investment securities, sold mainly due to the cotangent [ph] tax law ramification",neg,train
"I will thank you all for your time this morning, and now, we will open it up to answer your questions",neg,train
I'm pleased to report that our new hires in 2017 and the Bank of Napa team are off to a great start,neg,train
"Our new CLO, Jim Kimball, has been on the field, meeting with bankers and developing sales and marketing strategies to better serve existing customers and attract new ones",neg,train
Jim's proven track record of building a meaningful productive team is a great asset for the bank,neg,train
There is s not any anything significant embedded in other places associated with those…,neg,train
"Just trying to -- around tax reform, any kind of early indications of increased activity there?",neg,train
"So while the money comes and goes, the totals are pretty stable",neg,train
Scott is integrating the commercial banking team - commercial banking sales team in Napa and expanding our presence in the Wine sector,neg,train
"In terms of deposit pricing in the quarter, how much of that was related to the acquisition?",neg,test
Now let me turn it over to Tani for additional insights on our financial results,neg,train
"These results were directly impacted by a deferred tax asset write down of $3 million, which amounts to 1",neg,train
The North Bay suffered serious losses due to the October wildfire,neg,train
"Fortunately, our clients and the bank itself did not experience any significant damage",neg,train
Along the effects of this disaster on the business community are something we are monitoring and assessing carefully,neg,train
That has been probably the most effective office we've had in our system over the last year,neg,train
"And we are in the market over they're and East Bay is, as you probably are aware, it is that [indiscernible] quarter is a tremendous number of C&I type opportunities",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our first question on the audio line comes from the line of Jeff Rulis with D,neg,train
"You had mentioned some lending in Oakland, just the increase that’s going on there",neg,train
Can you just provide a little bit more color on what some of the drivers of that are?,neg,train
"Our loan loss reserve to total loan, including acquired loans was 0",neg,train
"94% at December 31, 2017, 1% at September 30 and 1",neg,train
And our last question is a follow-up question from the line of Matthew Clark with Piper Jaffray,neg,train
"Yes, what I shared a little bit earlier was that if you assume about a 10 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate, that would probably be a conservative estimate",neg,train
Acquisition expenses and tax law changes reduced return on assets by 22 basis points to 0,neg,train
"75%, and return on equity risk was reduced by 186 basis points to 6",neg,train
"We have every expectation that the investments made in 2017, coupled with new tax law, will position Bank of Marin for improved efficiencies, higher returns and EPS accretion over time",neg,train
"So as we go forward, we're going to see how that market kind of, settles out because there will be – certainly be changes in the pricing of tax-exempt deals with only a 21% corporate tax rate that will make them less attractive, certainly, to the borrowers and close the gap somewhat to tax and financing",neg,train
"Good morning and thank you for joining Bank of Marin Bancorp's Earnings Call for the Fourth Quarter, ended December 31, 2017",neg,train
"I am Jarrod Gerhardt, Senior Vice President, Director of Marketing for Bank of Marin",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 22, 2018",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"In addition, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0",neg,train
This represents the 51st consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Bank of Marin Bancorp,neg,train
It is worth noting that the bank has never reduced the dividend,neg,train
"As Russ mentioned, when comparing 2017 earnings for the fourth quarter and full year to early periods, it is helpful to refer to the table on Page 5 of our press release",neg,train
"This table begins with reported earnings for the period shown and renewals the impact of acquisition related expenses and the deferred tax asset write down associated with the tax cut and Jobs Act of 2017, which was passed in December",neg,train
"So organic growth, we're confident about organic growth in the future",neg,train
"I can't give you numbers because we don't give guidance on that, but needless to say, we're - our expectations are high in terms of what we can do in this market",neg,train
"We have a pipeline which, going into this year, which is pretty substantial, particularly because we had – it was one of interesting times in the month of December, we had a big number that was we thought might close, and virtually, none of it closed and it all got pushed over to the first quarter",neg,train
And what else was your question I don't remember beyond that?,neg,train
"It's those kinds of deposits which - while are large and they are kind of transitory deposits, those others - the other deposits replacing on the other end",neg,train
So we've been pretty - we watched that pretty closely,neg,train
"And this year – this year we had less of the migration out than in past years so it was not a dip, the deposit grew over the year",neg,train
We never really had a time when we had a big decline,neg,train
And we evaluate other ways to utilize the capital with growth opportunity,neg,train
"By any measure, we had a productive year and we appreciate the efforts of everyone on our team who contributed to this success",neg,test
"A lot of lightning, distribution, wholesalers, things of that nature, which gives us great opportunity to build our portfolio",neg,train
"When you have great results, you usually have great people",neg,train
And our people are performing at a very high level right now,neg,train
"Based on our legacy portfolio only, the ratio of loan loss reserves to loans was 1",neg,train
The loan-to-deposit ratio was 78% and our constant deposit remains low at 7 basis points,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jackie Boland with KBW,neg,test
"We're growing the demand deposit at such a clip that our cost of funding - our cost of deposits remains at 7 basis points, which is a pretty nice benefit that we have and really value of our franchise that we have, the high levels of demand deposits which keeps our cost of funding",neg,train
"So if you look at the table on page 4 of the press release, which talks about accretion in gains on sales – the purchase loans, you can see that scheduled accretion was 4 basis points for the fourth quarter",neg,train
"I don't think that will go up by much for scheduled accretion, going forward",neg,train
"And obviously, we expect - our expectation for other offices that they would grow at a higher level too",neg,test
"Bank Of Marin Bancorp (NASDAQ:BMRC) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 22, 2018 11:30 AM ET",neg,train
The addition of key people and the expansion of our footprint have bolstered Bank Of Marin’s already strong reputation,neg,train
"This has allowed us to continue to build market share, even as more community banks are migrating to the attractive Bay Area market and the Central Valley in Southern California",neg,test
We continue to have conversations with banks in markets that we find appealing,neg,train
But I think the bulk of it is probably done at this point,neg,train
We haven't changed our pricing on our rates yet and I think our relationship model surfaced really well associated our deposit pricing because we have such a big percentage of CDA accounts,neg,train
And those are really operating accounts and are not as interest rate sensitive,neg,train
"Of course, we don't know what impact any early payoffs we’re going to have on net interest income, but the scheduled accretion is a very small amount",neg,train
"On the merger cost, those are running pretty much in line with what we expected",neg,train
"We think we have about $1 million more to go, roughly",neg,train
And if you have another part of the M&A cost question,neg,train
"A primary focus for 2018 will be organic growth, which we are set to deliver based on the strengthen of our team, our expanded footprint in the Bay Area market, our track record and reputation, and our relationship banking model",neg,train
"And then in terms of the securities portfolio, would you plan to be doing anymore restructuring of that, that might lead to gains or losses?",neg,train
"So I guess if 4% organic growth in '17, that would be at the low end of what you think in '18?",neg,test
"Our organic growth was strong in 2017, as a result of healthy and broad-based increases in both deposits and loans",neg,train
"9 million in deposit we acquired with Bank of Napa, total deposits were up 21",neg,train
"I read that - there's some puts and takes there if you were in that 34%, 35% previously, down to 21% at the corporate level in that ballpark, is it a decent assumption?",neg,train
"Russ, just going back to the '18 strategic focus is on organic growth",neg,train
Could you put that into any context of - it sounds like '17 was more of a reinvestment or acquired acquisitions that while you continue to look for those,neg,test
"We do have a number of large borrowers, I mean, large depositors, who have - keep the substantial deposits in the bank",neg,test
We have some large contractors who do a lot of municipal work,neg,train
"And when they get a new contract, then they get funded and the money comes in the bank, and when they do the work, they money goes out",neg,train
"The underpinning of our success in this business cycle has always been our strong credit culture, and 2017 was no exception",neg,train
"We did make a $500,000 provision for loan losses due to continuing organic loan growth",neg,train
This practice is associated with potential long-term impact from the recent wildfires and the acquisition,neg,train
We are pleased to review our results with you for the fourth quarter and year end,neg,train
"We successfully completed our acquisition of Bank of Napa, which positions Bank of Marin for continued growth in both Napa County and the Wine Industry, which have become a strategic focus for us in the recent years",neg,test
"First of all, the provision is really the growth that we experienced in growth that we – in terms of growth expectation in the first quarter",neg,train
So some of that is related to that because we really anticipate that there is a fair amount of loan to book in this first quarter,neg,train
So our expectations are very high for that first quarter,neg,train
"It was more - yes, within the line item, was that in data processing? If I were to, kind of, itemize that in salaries or",neg,train
"Like I said, our expectations are high for our growth, going forward",neg,train
"THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HERE IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL, CONFERENCE PRESENTATION OR OTHER AUDIO PRESENTATION, AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE AUDIO PRESENTATIONS",neg,test

USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S AUDIO PRESENTATION ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS,neg,train
5 percentage points due to the deferred tax asset write down,neg,train
"Without this charge, the effective tax rate would have been slightly lower than the previous 3 years",neg,train
"Joining us on the call today are Russ Colombo, President and CEO; and Tani Girton, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
"Our earning press release, which we issued this morning, can be found on our website at bankofmarin",neg,train
Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements,neg,train
"For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the forward-looking statements disclosure in our earnings press release as well as our SEC filings",neg,train
"Following the prepared remarks, Russ and Tani will be available to answer your questions",neg,train
"And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Russ Colombo",neg,train
"As you just heard, we achieved a great deal in 2017",neg,train
"We hired the right people, we strengthened our platform and to help unlock future growth opportunity",neg,train
And so I guess as it ties into the provision level you alluded to this quarter that the pickup there was based on growth and kind of the unknown risk from the fires,neg,train
"Any comment on provisioning levels as you are more optimistic perhaps, on growth and that unknown, - any commentary on the provisioning levels?",neg,train
"As we announced on our prior call, we expanded our team with several strategic tiers in 2017",neg,train
"These include James Kimball, EVP and Chief Operating Officer and Scott McAdams, SVP in Commercial Banking, Regional Manager for our Napa and Sonoma market",neg,train
So the biggest component of the acquisition expenses are in the conversions in the prior Bank of Napa data processing provider and conversion expenses to our data processing provider termination expenses on the data processing provider from Napa and then also professional services,neg,train
"However, acquisitions happen when they happen and it's difficult to plan for that",neg,train
"We have, since Jim came over, Jim was with Wells Fargo prior to being here",neg,train
He has got a lot of experience in the North Bay in particular,neg,train
"And bringing that knowledge and experience and in addition to that Scott McAdams in Napa has the same, a lot of experience in North Bay",neg,train
"I would say, the drivers of that are the team that we've assembled there",neg,test
So just - I know you guys mentioned some information about the tax rate,neg,test
"But for you guys this tax strategies, is there any potential - anything that you might do in the future could that could influence the rate going forward in addition to just kind of the recent tax law changes?",neg,train
"28 per share demonstrate the same underlying strength as 2016's record earnings, when you consider that $2",neg,train
47 per share of 2016 earnings were related to loan recovery and early payoffs of acquired loans,neg,train
I don't know if that means that the - your organic expectations for '18 would be greater than '17,neg,train
"If you could, kind of, put any words around your expectations versus '17 and '18?",neg,train
"Just while we are on the deposits subject, was there anything in the $90 million that you would consider to be temporary that you might lose in the first quarter?",neg,train
I'm hoping to get a little more color around your commentary about the pipeline being substantial,neg,train
I know your view of comparison aren't good with the Bank of Napa acquisition,neg,train
"Okay, so no - really not getting much pressure at this point in time even with the December rate hike from customers?",neg,train
"I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning, and we will talk with all of you again next quarter",neg,train
And now I will turn the call back over to Russ for some closing comments,neg,train
"But that's going to be developing over the next, I think, 6 to 12 months in terms of, kind of, like with us, when we say maybe we look at projects which we might have delayed, maybe we do them right now",neg,train
"Of course, the acquisition and strategic hires we made during the year impacted our profitability and efficiency metrics for 2017",neg,test
2 percentage points of which was related to acquisition expenses,neg,test
2017 fourth quarter net interest income was $20 million compared to $18,neg,test
8 million in the third quarter and $18 million in the fourth quarter last year,neg,train
The higher level of interest earning asset in 2017 more than offset the interest recovery and accelerated acquired loan accretion of 2016,neg,train
"For the year, non-interest income was down $893,000 due to this special FHLB dividend and gains on the sales of investment securities in 2016",neg,train
"Fourth quarter 2017 non-interest expense was higher than third quarter, primarily due to $2",neg,train
"I'd say, if you take it down 10 percentage points, that's going to be conservative",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Don Worthington with Raymond James,neg,train
"They are actually in the release, if you look on page - hold on a second, page 6 of the release",neg,train
"You can see loans were $135 million and total deposits were $250 million, rounded",neg,train
"Okay, and then on the tax question, we do expect the tax rate to go down associated with the change in the tax law",neg,train
There are - so it's not entirely additive because there are some permanent differences that as a percentage of effective tax rate change because they are – hard dollar related,neg,train
But going from a 35% tax rate to a 21% tax rate on a federal bases is going to have a significant impact on our tax rate and reduce it,neg,train
"I know you've broken out for the acquisition, are there any other non-recurring items in either of those and do you guys have a ballpark run rate range for each of these two items?",neg,test
And then just last one on the targeting cost [phase] for Bank of Napa,neg,train
Any change in terms of the magnitude and timing as to how those are realized?,neg,train
"But can you, kind of, sensitize maybe Legacy, Bank of Marin, and how that compares year-over-year and how much of that might be fire-related with maybe increased demand there or just the change in the environment with tax reforms?",neg,test
"But that being said, what Tani said about the relation with banking [ph] model and demand because we have growth of $90 million in demand deposits in the fourth quarter",neg,train
I don't see a lot of demand from the - which is fire-related at this point,neg,train
It just takes -- it's a long time to get through the process,neg,train
So we have to kind of step back on that particular program that we've been doing,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today",neg,train
"We thank you for your participation, and ask that you kindly disconnect your lines",neg,test
We believe our strong competitive position is in large part due to the relation banking model that has served us well for the past 28 years,neg,train
"1 million over the full year 2016 not only due to acquisition related expenses, but also to additional staff, annual merit increases and higher insurance expenses, partially offset by lower SBIC assessment",neg,train
1 million in after-tax expenses related to our acquisition of Bank of Napa,neg,train
"Without these two items, diluted earnings per share would have been $0",neg,train
"5 million for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively",neg,train
Please refer to Page 5 of our press release for a more detailed reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures,neg,train
"So our cost of deposits really didn't change, and we did get some contribution in our CDA non-interest bearing accounts from Napa",neg,train
"We do get - periodically, we get a request from somebody who has seen rates going up but we haven't gotten a lot of pressure thus far to raise our rates",neg,train
Is there any additional benefit - if any at all our remaining from your tax strategies that could influence the tax rate going forward?,neg,train
"And whenever you have an acquisition, it takes time to integrate that and it does change the organization to a certain extent, so we provision for that",neg,train
"That being said, so far, this acquisition has gone really well",neg,train
"And the people are terrific that we've - from Bank of Napa, that we've acquired",neg,train
"Their culture matches are exceptionally low, and we're very, very pleased thus far as we move towards full integration, which will be in April",neg,train
"Jim is responsible for growing the bank, customer facing businesses across our Bay Area footprint",neg,train
"And then, I guess, my last question is, in terms of the benefit from a lower tax rate, any thoughts on how that might be deployed? Your expenses, initiatives or dividend policy?",neg,train
"In addition, as we mentioned about the fires, we really don't know what the long-term impact of that going is going to be",neg,train
"And so, part of the provisioning is really, kind of, safety, just because we don't know what the impact and we plan for the worst and hope for the best, that's kind of the way I would term it",neg,train
What categories did those come from and are we anticipating more merger costs going forward and then the next one on just your expected tax rate in '18 and '19? Thanks,neg,train
"But that's an interesting question, because obviously, the tax rate will affect the pricing on those and in our portfolio currently that's one of the things that those deals with price based on with the tax time, although, in many of them, we have the ability to make changes in those rates",neg,test
"So that will happen over the next 6 to 12 months, for sure",neg,train
So there are a lot of costs associated with getting the deal done in terms of writing the S4 [ph] and other filings that we have to do with the SEC - accounting expenses associated with those,neg,train
"So I look at it not on a quarter-on-quarter basis, but on a year-on-year basis",neg,train
"Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today",neg,train
We're pleased to report another quarter of strong and improving results and a great finish to a year of significant progress and good execution,neg,train
We're taking good care of our customers and we enter 2018 with some nice momentum,neg,test
"The net results in commercial reflect a 7 basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and optimization efforts",neg,train
"Also, Citizens remains well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with our asset sensitivity relatively unchanged at 5",neg,train
"And then on the medium term targets, the ROE outlook and the efficiency ratio, in terms of medium term, how do you define that timeframe, just want to get a little bit of clarity around that and then what type of rate environment do those medium term targets assume?",neg,train
"Turning to fees on page 12, on an underlying basis, noninterest income increased 2% linked quarter, largely reflecting strength in FX and interest rate products and trust and investment services fees along with positive results in mortgage banking and letter of credit and loan fees",neg,train
"These growth areas were partially offset by lower capital market fees, which were still strong but came off the record levels we delivered the past couple of quarters",neg,train
"Year-over-year, our noninterest income was up 3%, driven by strength in the capital markets business, given our expanded capabilities, higher trust and investment services fees, given the improved sales productivity and fee based sales results",neg,test
"Card fees were also better, given the higher purchase volumes, along with the benefit of the first quarter revision of contract terms for processing fees",neg,train
"While mortgage banking fees were down driven by a decline in servicing fees with a relatively stable production fee income, our origination volumes outperformed",neg,train
"It just feels like an appropriate glide path, whether that SIFI threshold was at 50 billion or 250 billion",neg,train
"On capital, it looks like you've got some run down built in but really not targeting CET 1 much lower than you did previously, despite the fact that we seem to be entering an elusive regulatory environment, why is that?",neg,train
"Thanks, John and I think you missed the first quarter there",neg,train
"So, let's turn to page 27 and let's focus on where we're taking Citizens over the medium term",neg,train
"We aim to become a top performing, widely admired bank",neg,train
And our Credo informs and guides our culture and behaviors,neg,train
"This mission, vision and credo really resonates with our stakeholders and is a key foundation of our past success and it's an important reason I am confident in our future outlook",neg,train
"As a result of these efforts, in addition to higher rates, we've expanded consumer portfolio yield by 5 basis points in the quarter and 38 basis points year-over-year",neg,train
"This growth is muted somewhat by our efforts to reduce capital historically deployed against lower return areas like select portions of the C&I book, where we aren’t gaining in crosssell and in asset finance where we had historically focused on big ticket leases, given RBS ownership",neg,train
"So with that, let me turn it over to our CFO John Woods who will take you through the numbers in more detail and provide you with some color",neg,train
"I think you said it well, we think there's a good opportunity and continued DDA growth",neg,train
We’re pleased with the progress we have there this year,neg,test
And our next question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"Our success in hitting our medium term IPO financial targets has led to our establishment of new medium term targets, which we will cover in some detail later in the call",neg,train
I’ve noticed that some of your deposit growth has been decent and then your deposit betas have also started to slow a bit from the beginning of the year,neg,train
"The other thing is, when you talked about your long term kind of goals and profitability, one of the things that you said under your operating assumptions was asset sensitivity moderates as rates normalize",neg,train
"Does that encompass neutralizing the asset sensitivity because you have about $7 billion that needs to be extended, neutralized?",neg,train
We continue to actively manage our capital base with a 7% year-over-year increase in our tangible book value per share to $27,neg,train
48 and a robust year end CET 1 ratio of 11,neg,train
1 billion to common shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases,neg,train
And we continue our positive trajectory with the 22% increase in our quarterly common dividend that we announced today,neg,train
"Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent, reflecting the ongoing mix shift towards high quality lower risk retail loans and a relatively clean position in the commercial book",neg,train
"The non-performing loan ratio improved 6 basis points versus the prior quarter to 79 basis points of loans this quarter, while improving 18 basis points from the year ago quarter",neg,test
"The net charge-off rate increased to 28 basis points from 24 basis points in the third quarter, given seasonal impacts and the maturing of our portfolio",neg,train
"On page 23, we review our full year performance against the guidance we provided at the start of 2017",neg,train
"You can see the green ticks on the right column, demonstrating another year of strong execution",neg,train
And the next question in queue will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
"So I think certainly in the near term, most of that tax benefit flows through",neg,train
"We announced at the end of the year the bonus program for certain employees here and a contribution to the community foundation that we run, which I think was the right thing to do",neg,train
"I think, we've been funding that at a very good clip",neg,train
"So, at the margin, we might try to get a few more things through a little faster, but I think that's really at the margin",neg,train
"John, maybe best for you, but question just on the loan growth guidance, so it looks like as you look into the first quarter, pretty steady rate of growth with what you've been doing recently, but to get to the full year guidance, it looks like it might take a little bit of an acceleration throughout the course of the year",neg,train
"One, am I interpreting that correctly? And two, just maybe a little more color on what the drivers would be behind any acceleration?",neg,train
We expect to deliver solid top line growth while driving annual positive operating leverage in the range of 3% to 5%,neg,train
This should lead to continued efficiency ratio improvement down to 52% to 56% and we also expect to see some normalization in credit from the excellent performance that we're seeing today,neg,train
"Over this timeframe, we would expect to reduce our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 to 40 basis points annually to a target of around 10%",neg,train
"As we did with the original ROTCE walk, we presented an updated version with a roadmap of how we think we can go from roughly 10% today to 14% on a full year basis give or take with time",neg,train
"Just a point or two, I think, a good way to think about it in an environment such as 2018 where we expect rates to move and we've got 94 basis points, I think the number that you heard from Bruce around 30% to 40% is a good way to think about would be to contribute",neg,train
"And in a period where there is no rate moves, really, a lot of the drive comes from BSO",neg,train
"So for example, in 4Q, there was a little bit of rate overhang left in 4Q, so 3 basis points that you saw in 4Q, maybe close to 2 of that came from BSO, because we didn't have a rate move",neg,train
"But again, when you get out to ’18, they will go back to 30% to 40%, Ken, as you heard from Bruce",neg,train
"And actually, really it doubled down on -- in an environment where there is no rate move, we're still focused on self-help and we're still driving net interest margin in an environment like that",neg,train
"Wanted to focus on the balance sheet optimization and in all your kind of guidances and you get to funding, you talk about loan to deposit ratios and you’re bumping up against that 100% level, but given the methodology of liquidity coverage ratios, shouldn't that be the driving force for liquidity versus your loan to deposit ratio? Do you see 100% as any type of constraint on your balance sheet and loan growth?",neg,train
"So anyway, I'd say that's our call at this point, if 2017 -- 2018 plays out like 2017, there could be some positive upside there",neg,test
"I would say on the consumer side, we haven't seen a lot of change",neg,train
"It’s been pretty – certainly, the market has been rational without question, a few competitors have entered in the rural space, the education and refinance space, but it really hasn't moved the market much, and in fact obviously on the auto side, we’ve maybe seen margins even widens a little bit on the auto side, which is encouraging",neg,train
"We're now moving to the good news having been largely caught up, we can focus on playing “offence”",neg,train
So I'd say that's really where the future spend is going,neg,train
"And so, I'd say it's fundamentally roughly a three year view plus or minus depending on what happens in the environment",neg,train
"Again, one of the keys will be what happens with rates over that period",neg,train
You can see on the walk on the page that still we have an asset sensitive position,neg,train
"If we look at triage among dot plots, consensus estimates, forward curve, we come up with an expectation right now that we should see two rate hikes per year for the next three years",neg,train
We’ve been targeting this approximately 40 basis points or so of capital decline glide path over time,neg,train
I think that serves us well over a couple of -- through a couple of lenses,neg,train
"This past year, we were the victim of basically higher earnings and a little bit lower RWA usage as we talked about earlier on the call in terms of loan growth and of course the tax legislations",neg,train
So I think there are some unique factors that were at play in 2017 and I think we'll get back on that glide path reduction on CET 1 in 2018 and beyond,neg,train
"I really don't have anything to add other than I really completely -- we expect to have more partnership announcements this year and expect to have then, some degree of risk sharing through all the partnerships",neg,train
So I think one of the goals we have is to close the NIM gap that we have with the peer median,neg,train
"So we know we still have mix work to do, we still have some pricing work to do and we have now, I think at this point, under John’s leadership, put this into a more formalized program where we'll have tasks and we'll monitor progress and just like we do with the TOP programs",neg,train
"And so we're, I’d say, by 2021, I think we'll have gone through 50% of the branches as the target",neg,test
But I think you can get more efficient in terms of your touch points with your customers in a digital sense than versus the higher cost full branch structure,neg,train
"So -- anyway so there's good work going on, on the expense side of the house",neg,train
And so I was just going to add one thing that our direct to consumer marketing effort in home equity has been really successful following the build out in data and analytics and we improved our originations in that channel from about 150 million in 2015 to over 1 billion in 2017,neg,test
"So we're not sitting here reliant on the rates, but they certainly would create a tailwind if that scenario develops",neg,train
And our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan,neg,train
"Turning to expenses on page 13, on an underlying basis , expenses were stable compared to the third quarter",neg,train
"Lower salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses were offset by an increase in outside services, which includes costs related to our strategic growth initiatives",neg,train
"Year on year, our expenses were up 1%, as salary and benefit expense was higher, reflecting the impact of strategic hiring, merit increases and higher revenue based incentives",neg,train
We also saw an increase in outside services costs tied to our strategic growth initiatives,neg,train
"On auto, I'd say we've been using that when there was not much loan demand, we ran it from 10 billion or 11 billion, up to 14 billion and now we have it back down in the 13s and it's running back down to 10 or 11",neg,train
"And right now, we're in a mode of withdrawing capital from that business, but the HELOC has been, as Brad said, more environmental",neg,train
"We're actually putting new lines on the books, but we're still suffering from paydowns",neg,train
"And so, in the short term, that's been a headwind",neg,train
"And it's one of the higher yielding asset classes, could you just describe some of the puts and takes on why that's growing at the level it is",neg,train
"As Bruce mentioned, our reported results reflect the impact of tax reform and other notable items that we’ve detailed on page 5 of the earnings presentation",neg,train
"Including these items, we generated net income of 666 million, EPS of $1",neg,train
35 and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 20% for the fourth quarter,neg,train
"For the full year, including the notable items detailed on page 37, we delivered net income to common of $1",neg,train
"And of course, our lawyers want me to remind everyone that in addition to today’s press release, we’ve also provided a presentation and financial supplement and each materials are available at investor",neg,train
"We provide information about the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from our expectations in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today",neg,train
We also utilize non-GAAP financial measures and provide information and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP in our SEC filings and earnings release materials,neg,train
"On page 22, you can see the steady and impressive progress we're making in improving our performance",neg,train
And our underlying efficiency ratio has improved from 68% to 58,neg,train
Our EPS continues on a very strong trajectory as well with a CAGR of nearly 30% over the past four years to $0,neg,train
"While we are pleased with the performance, we still have opportunity for further improvements, which we will cover shortly",neg,train
"And then on revenues, we've got to get back to growing households",neg,train
"We've invested in something we call, customer journeys, to try to really make like for example, the account opening experience, be really pleasurable for the new customer and that has a good impact on keeping that customer, the fraud experience, problem resolution, there's a number of these journeys that we’re re-engineering from front to back, which I think will help boost the top line by reducing attrition, increasing loyalty and increasing crosssell and the consumer portfolios also are contributing",neg,train
"So as we grow personal and secured and education, et cetera, those portfolios drop a lot of net interest income to the bottom line",neg,test
"Our commercial net charge-off was very low again this quarter, while retail net charge-offs were 11 million higher than the third quarter, in part due to higher seasonality in auto and education and a modest reduction in recovery",neg,train
Provision for credit losses of 83 million was 5 million above charge-offs,neg,train
"The provision was up 11 million compared to a relatively low level in the third quarter and down 19 million versus a year ago, reflecting the improvement in overall credit quality",neg,train
"Lastly, our allowance to total loans and leases ratio was relatively stable at 1",neg,train
12% and our NPL coverage ratio improved to 142% from 131% in the third quarter and 118% in the year ago quarter,neg,train
And there's a bunch of things that go into that,neg,train
"It's the spot posture that the regulators have regarding the stress test, but then also the rating agencies and what you're targeting in terms of your credit rating",neg,test
"Excluding the notable items, underlying fourth quarter results were very strong",neg,train
"4%, net income to common of 349 million was up 24% while EPS was up 29% year-on-year",neg,train
"4% with strong NII and fee income result across our businesses, which drove the improvement in our efficiency ratio to 58",neg,train
"Overall, credit quality continues to be excellent with non-performing loans coming down to 79 basis points of loans",neg,train
"And as you mentioned Matt, what we call treasury solutions here, the cash management business being the biggest element of that should get a real kick probably not till late in the year, because the re-platforming starts to roll out late this year, but I think we've made steady improvements to the platform and now we're going to take a step function to having a really terrific platform",neg,train
And so I think we’ll start to get even more traction on treasury solutions,neg,test
"Treasury solutions, I think, has been growing in the high single digits, even without that",neg,train
"So we've had strengthened our card offerings and our payables offerings and some of the other areas, but not as much in the core cash management space",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
I would add to that John and say that I think the consumer side has been relatively consistent,neg,train
So we kind of get the run rate of 5% annualized growth almost quarter in and quarter out where we need to start to see the build is on the commercial side,neg,test
"And I think as John indicated, the pipelines are good",neg,train
"I think, there's been some pent up demand looking into Washington and some uncertainty",neg,train
What was going to happen now that that's been resolved and I think there's positive sentiment towards the tax cut,neg,train
So we would expect to see the commercial side pick up a bit,neg,train
"Don, do you want to add any color to that?",neg,train
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the BSO part of TOP plus BSO and maybe help frame us in terms of whether it's in terms of the 9 to 12 basis point NIM name expansion for ’18 or just a broader sense of how much upside do you see from that program specifically and separate that from rates maybe?,neg,train
"Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
My name is Brad and I'll be your operator today,neg,test
"As you point out, the LCR is actually a much more sharp instrument to determine what's the nature of your actual liquidity and funding position",neg,train
"And so there, we've had a very strong LCR just because we have in the deposits a high percentage of our deposits come from consumer, which stress test very, very well and we've termed out all of our borrowings",neg,train
"We have the same kind of term funding structure that our peers do, which we didn't have originally",neg,train
We're pleased with where we have the LCR and we feel very good about our overall liquidity and funding position,neg,train
"Consumer efficiency ratio, Bruce, John, still pretty high, up given or take 72% last few quarters",neg,train
"What's your outlook in that, what will it take to get that down meaningfully, because obviously we've had rate hikes, the rate hikes have obviously greater benefit upfront",neg,train
"So, is that a question of scale or what do you think you need to do to get that down meaningfully?",neg,train
What I would say Peter first off is that's about the guidance that we gave for 2017 was I think the same exact range that we're giving for 2018,neg,train
So we were very favorably surprised by how strong the environment was and how all of our credit metrics improved,neg,test
"I think when you now turn the calendar and look at ’18, one of the questions is we want to get the loan growth in the range that we talked about, midpoint of that is 5",neg,train
"So for the industry and for Citizens, the big books of origination were back in the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 timeframe",neg,train
"So, our largest books that are hitting the end of the draw period come to an end in 2008",neg,train
So that's really what more of the drag has been for both the industry and the Citizens and senior home equity portfolio grow,neg,test
"On page 17, looking at the funding side, we saw a 2 basis point sequential quarter increase in our cost of deposits, reflecting the impact of higher rates, but also good discipline and progress on initiatives",neg,train
"We continue to find attractive balance sheet growth at accretive risk adjusted returns, which is driving NIM higher in spite of these gradually rising deposit costs",neg,train
Our overall funding costs were also up 2 basis points sequentially,neg,train
"Year-over-year, our cost of funds was up 21 basis points, reflecting deposit cost increase of 17 basis points as well as a shift to more long term funding",neg,train
This compares with overall asset yield expansion of 39 basis points,neg,train
"Our deposit betas remain in line with our overall expectations, given where we are in the rate cycle and we feel good about our ability to execute against our optimization strategies and become more effective in our future deposit gathering",neg,train
"And then if I could just ask one more on the margin, so obviously some pretty decent expansion here, as you look into the first quarter, I guess, I'm just curious how you see the progression going throughout the year? I guess my initial guess would have been the guide could have been even a little bit higher, just trying to figure out if that's conservatism or any sort of change in anticipated deposit betas or how you see things progressing?",neg,train
And that's significant in the leverage finance business as in the underwriting business,neg,test
"I think for us, some of that’s being offset and the one thing we didn’t talk about in terms of the progression of the fee revenues is in addition to the investments we've been making",neg,train
"So the fact as you know, it's kind of a put and take constantly, but net net, we're doing pretty well",neg,train
"Overall, average loans were up 1% on a linked quarter basis and 4% year-over-year",neg,train
"In consumer, we grew the portfolio 5% year-over-year with continued expansion in residential mortgages and high risk adjusted return categories like education, which is largely tied to our refinance product as well as continued strength in other unsecured retail loans, which continues to be driven by our product financing partnerships and our personnel unsecured product",neg,train
"I think this will be a team effort, but Brad, why don't you start with the color on the consumer side and some of the geographic markets that we have",neg,train
It will come from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill and Partners,neg,train
"I will say with the changes in tax legislation, we expect more activity in general",neg,train
There was one slight anomaly in the fourth quarter that we called a couple of deals forward in the third quarter in terms of closing,neg,train
"And if you pushed into the first quarter, so it was always a timing difference and we did see people, both on the M&A side and on the syndicated loan side basically migrate around at year end, based on what their individual cash aspects of their transaction are",neg,train
"And on the commercial side, we've been investing in our geographies, in our growth markets and opportunity and talent along with that geographic expansion",neg,train
It’s been a good quarter for us on the unsecured side,neg,train
"So our partnerships, including the Apple relationship, has been strong, so we’ve seen good growth there",neg,train
So all of those are good risk adjusted assets and we see some good runway in all of those products,neg,train
We announced an increase in our Q1 dividend of 22% to $0,neg,train
22 per share and we returned $424 million to shareholders in Q4 from both dividends and share repurchases,neg,train
"As we look to 2018, we expect our agenda to be largely consistent with 2017",neg,train
"We are hopeful that the macro environment will deliver some tailwinds, given the recent tax legislation, faster economic growth, a path to higher short rates and regulatory reform",neg,train
"On page nine, for the full year, we delivered underlying EPS growth of 34% with positive operating leverage of 6",neg,train
"Notwithstanding an increasingly competitive environment, average loans were up 6%",neg,train
"At the same time, we expanded our net interest margin by 16 basis points",neg,train
We are also seeing the solid return on the investments in our fee businesses as underlying non-interest income was up 7% in 2017,neg,train
"I mean, it was really beginning -- at the beginning of last year, where I felt we really organized the business around strategic deposit gathering",neg,train
"And before that, I think we were lurching a little bit in and out of the market in terms of gathering deposits and we're now managing over a multi-quarter basis, so that’s helped us gather with our core clients in a much better way and contain costs at the same time",neg,train
We expect continued growth in noninterest income in the 4,neg,train
We expect our LDR to be about 98% and CET 1 at the end of the year between 10,neg,train
"This payout ratio would be higher, but for the first half impact of tax legislation and the timing of CCAR",neg,test
I think the question over time is what happens in the marketplace to some of our peers,neg,train
"We don't intend to lead on this, but do some folks offer a little bit back and get more aggressive on loan terms, for example, that takes the market to a different place than it is today",neg,train
"I don't anticipate that happening in the near term, but we'll see how that plays out over time",neg,train
"So we're optimistic that there should be a pretty good benefit that we get to produce in 2018 from the overall tax reform and I think that should be pretty well sustainable in our view, although over time, you might see a little bit of it competed away",neg,train
The highlights of the quarter from my perspective were the continued delivery of good top line growth with 8% year-on-year underlying revenue growth as well as robust positive operating leverage of 6,neg,test
"For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 10% and the operating leverage was 6",neg,train
The commitment to positive operating leverage has powered improvement in our key metrics,neg,train
4% in Q4 and our efficiency ratio improved to 58,neg,test
"On pages 24 and 25, we detail our guidance for 2018",neg,train
"Quite similar to 2017 with good top line growth, a 3% to 5% positive operating leverage target, further efficiency ratio improvements and capital normalization",neg,train
"We are expecting slightly slower loan growth overall given competitive market conditions, but still in the range of 4",neg,train
Growth will be focused in the areas we believe offer attractive risk adjusted returns,neg,train
"We should see strong NIM improvement in the range of 9 to 12 basis points, which reflects market expectations for rate hikes in April and October as well as continued execution on our balance sheet optimization efforts",neg,train
"Net interest margin improved 3 basis points linked quarter and 18 basis points year-over-year, which reflects a nice improvement in loan yields and better result in deposits, given the benefit of our balance sheet optimization efforts and a more constructive rate environment",neg,train
"On a linked quarter basis, retail and commercial loan yields were each up 5 basis points",neg,train
"Partially offsetting the higher loan yield, deposit costs were higher by 2 basis points, reflecting the rising short rates",neg,train
"Total average deposits increased 1% from the prior quarter, driven primarily by growth in demand and term deposits",neg,train
Period end deposits were up 2% with increases across most categories,neg,train
"On the commercial side, it's as aggressive as it’s ever been and it's basically a deal by deal, borrower by borrower",neg,train
"I think it's been down drafting materially for several quarters, if not several years",neg,train
So I think we're getting to a point where you're probably not going to see material incremental downdrafts,neg,test
"So it's an environment that we've been operating in for the last several years and we expect this to continue, but we're navigating",neg,train
"John, do you want to fill in the blanks on the betas?",neg,train
I might just add one thing on the mortgage side,neg,train
"Really, our growth up until now has been almost exclusively through hiring loan officers",neg,train
"But as we've been doing that, we’ve been making 1 billion investment in building the capability for direct to consumer, so building the data now really need to underpin your ability to do direct mail and digital offering and that investment has been made",neg,train
So we think we really are at a point [indiscernible],neg,train
And we will go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies,neg,train
"So as rates are higher, deposit betas go up and so you capture less from the moves that are late in a hike cycle as opposed to the earlier ones",neg,train
"And so we're not intending to say, this is the precise moment to put a big hedge on a neutralizer sensitivity",neg,train
"In fact, we've actually tried to maintain it a little bit here and we'll just let it glide down naturally with time",neg,train
"And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bruce",neg,train
"I would say for the most part, competition has been pretty well behaved",neg,train
"We've seen a little bit of increased competition on the money market side, but for the most part, the competition has been pretty well behaved, the deposit costs have been well behaved and competition has been pretty attractive",neg,train
"So, we're really moving away from promotional pricing and investing in analytics and the ability to do targeted digital offerings, targeted direct mail offerings, which we think will help us keep our deposit costs lower and keep our betas in check, but competitively, we feel pretty good about where the market's been",neg,train
"I'd say it's a combination of things, but the same positive operating leverage that works for the company is what we have to effect in the consumer business in order to keep driving that down",neg,train
"I think it -- actually when I was here, it probably was close to 80%, so we've had good headway in getting it this far",neg,train
There's a number of things that are going on on the cost side of the equation,neg,train
Brad has been a leader in the TOP programs and looking for efficiencies and straight through processing and that will continue,neg,train
"Now, I'll turn the call over to Ellen Taylor, Head of Investor Relations",neg,train
"And with that, let me turn things back over to Bruce",neg,train
"On slide 17, it looks like most of the funding growth has been coming from the term deposits or timed deposits",neg,train
"Can you just talk about that, like, I'm just curious more about the strategy, it doesn't obviously seem to be having an impact on your margin or your deposit base today, but I’m kind of wondering how that plays out over the next year or so?",neg,train
"And I think Don you can comment on this, but probably the new thing is the non-bank’s competition has really picked up",neg,train
"Mortgage, as we've talked about, we've had fits and starts in that business",neg,train
I think we now have a strategy that focuses more on conforming in the mix,neg,train
"So let's really get the retail channel the way we want it, more focused on conforming",neg,train
So that would be my kind of long winded highlight,neg,train
"And I don't know if I left any for you, John to fill in, but go ahead",neg,train
"Moving to page 5, let me cover the notable items in the quarter",neg,train
"Given the tax legislation in December, we’ve revalued our net deferred tax liability and recorded a one-time tax benefit of $331 million",neg,train
"All in, these items contributed 318 million to net income and $0",neg,train
"In addition, in connection with our continued balance sheet optimization program, we completed the sale of a $67 million TDR portfolio of home equity and mortgage loans at a pretax net gain of $17 million",neg,train
We utilize those proceeds to cover TOP IV initiative costs,neg,train
"And just a quick follow-up, if Congress were to raise the SIFI threshold, would that accelerate the medium-term target on your common equity tier 1 ratio?",neg,train
"And I think in the past, when you've been asked about bank M&A as a channel for deploying capital, the answer has been not yet, but three years out, post the IPO, you’ve hit the initial target, is that changing at all? Is there any more appetite for bank M&A?",neg,train
"And so we're pleased that the investments we have in the business have borne fruit, that the environment has been healthy and we would expect the capital markets on a year-over-year basis to be up in 2018 versus 2017",neg,train
"So, John, you could add here, but I think we don't anticipate a full parallel shift",neg,train
"But, if we really had a pure flattening of the curve, that would take away a percentage of the benefit",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of John Pancari with Evercore,neg,train
"It's to relatively safe, well thought out deals that are right in the middle of the fairway that are accretive and get us, like I like to say, farther down the track faster versus an organic pathway and then the rest of it is, let's keep focus on running the bank better and getting that organic growth and let's not get distracted going off and looking for bank M&A",neg,train
"Just on the tax side, just wanted to get your updated thoughts in terms of the benefit of tax reform, as you look at your expense base, since you look at your investments, I know you've got the TOP IV plan and the program is very much in place, how much of that tax benefit do you think longer term ends up accreting to the bottom line and sorry if you already alluded to that? And then separately, what areas in terms of technology spend are you putting new money to work? Thanks",neg,train
"On page 19, you can see that we continue to maintain robust capital and liquidity position",neg,train
We ended the quarter with a CET 1 ratio of 11,neg,test
2% when incorporating the benefit of a proposed FASB accounting standard tied to the recent tax legislation,neg,train
"We ended the year with a CET 1 ratio above guidance, given our strong fourth quarter performance, lower risk weighted assets and the impact of the tax legislation",neg,train
8 million shares and returned 424 million to common shareholders including dividend,neg,train
"As expected, our board approved a 22% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0",neg,train
And our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank,neg,test
"But, yeah, I think we will have more announcements this year",neg,train
We're working on some things that are in pilots and so stay tuned,neg,train
But this is a -- I think we provide a very high quality customer experience and a good partnership experience for our partners,neg,train
And so there's other folks who want to see if they can do a program similar to what we pioneered with Apple,neg,train
And I think each of the arrangements has its own negotiation around how the economics are going to work and so kind of the pricing that we get is oriented around a targeted rate of return,neg,train
And so if there is more loss sharing that we don't need as much for the use of our balance sheet and vice versa,neg,train
"So anyway, we're pleased in general that we can offer the flexibility",neg,train
We can construct these things around the rate of return and we think that the risk adjusted rate of return that we're getting are attractive at this point,neg,train
"On page 29, we unveil our new medium term financial targets",neg,train
"You can see that we've outlined our expectations for the overall economic environment, which is relatively constructive, particularly given the recent tax legislation",neg,test
"Over the medium term, we expect to deliver continued improvement in ROTCE, moving to 13% to 15%, including the benefit from the recent tax legislation",neg,train
"We expect a rising rate environment to be helpful in reaching our targets, as we are factoring in that short rates will increase on average a little over two times per year, given the current rate curve",neg,train
And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research,neg,train
"On page 28, let me identify some of the keys to taking our financial performance to the next level",neg,train
The good news is that we believe there's plenty more for us to do to drive improved performance,neg,train
We have plenty of fuel left in the tank so to speak,neg,train
I’ll highlight a couple of things here on this page,neg,train
"Well, we have actually worked to try to bring that down gradually",neg,train
"So the history was, we were probably in the 93 zone when I arrived and we needed to sell the Chicago region to fund the separation from RBS and some charges we had to take",neg,train
So we took the gain and that ultimately removed net about 5 billion of deposits that put the LDR up around 99,neg,train
And our guidance has been to bring that to 97 to 98,neg,train
"I do think there's still a psychological impact, if you go over 100",neg,test
"So I do think we are working to keep below that and maybe over time, bring the LDR back towards 95 or so",neg,train
"On page 20, we continue to provide color on how we are progressing against our strategic initiatives",neg,train
"I mean, we've built in an expectation that short rates will rise, that will rise faster than long rates over that timeframe, so we’ve already got that built in",neg,train
"So with that, operator Brad, let's open it up for some questions",neg,train
"I think they're right around mid-30s and I think relatively stable across the year, up and down a tick, and up a little bit year-over-year, so maybe low-30s ending 2016, getting into the low to the mid-30s here at the end of 2017",neg,train
And our next question in queue will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities,neg,train
"And then one last thing, if you do get that type of move at the short end, but not much follow through at the longer end, if you get a flattish curve throughout this period, does that take away much, are you still able to offset that?",neg,test
"The outlook of 9 to 12 basis points for 2018, in terms of deposit betas, those are built in, where deposit betas are behaving as expected at this point in the tightened cycle for us",neg,train
We did have some expectations that betas would continue to increase,neg,train
"The farther we get into the tightening cycle, so that is built in to the 9 to 12 basis points that we're talking about",neg,train
"And so, I think by – if we do get that April and October move from the Fed, we'll be right on target with moving towards the potential of the 300 basis points through the cycle move and we’re right on track from that perspective",neg,train
"So we felt pretty good about that NIM outlook, given what we've built in on betas",neg,train
"So I think the medium term, we're being, I think, just a little less specific than we were during the IPO walk when we kind of laid it out and said, it was three years and we hope to get the 10% by Q4 of ’16",neg,train
It actually took us three quarters more to do that,neg,train
"We executed the plan well, but we didn't get the lift in rates that we had anticipated",neg,train
"So I think our view now is to be a little less specific, just call it, medium term, but I still think you kind of think in terms of three year cycles",neg,train
We appreciate your interest and also your support along our journey,neg,train
We recognize however that there is still plenty of work in front of us to build a truly great bank,neg,train
"I think just to echo what John and Bruce said, I think we are seeing the pipelines build",neg,train
We're seeing the M&A pipelines build faster than the loan pipelines,neg,train
Just a quick question on the commercial utilization rates in the quarter,neg,train
Could you tell us where they were and then just how that compares to where they performed in the past?,neg,test
So that will give you a sense for basically what we expect there and maybe I’ll let Brad to add a lot of detail,neg,train
"So we would -- when we look at the HELOC on a risk adjusted return basis, it's very attractive and it's a great product for the mass affluent, which is a key segment of our consumer base",neg,train
There is beginning to be an appetite to do what I would describe as fee based bolt-ons,neg,train
"So the, Western Reserve M&A boutique that we bought in 2017 I think was a great transaction and it's working really well, integrated well and we're getting lots of two way flow with that property",neg,train
"I think we could do more things in commercial, in the capital markets space to keep building out our capabilities",neg,train
And our last question in queue will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks,neg,train
"What happened this year is that even though we thought that covered was pretty bare in terms of problem credits or back book issues, we still had a lot of positive surprises",neg,train
"So whatever we needed to fund in terms of the allowance build, we actually had offsets coming in, in terms of back book improvements",neg,train
"I don't know if you can -- again if you're really clean, can you count on that happening again",neg,train
"So I think we're being conservative here and just saying, well, let's assume we get the loan growth and let's assume we don't have a lot coming from back book credit improvements, then that would start to move your provision number higher",neg,train
"So if you look historically, Ken, we’ve probably approached close to 50-50 on the contribution from our NIM expansion from BSO",neg,train
"It wasn't necessarily a formal program, but just the steps that we're taking to focus on the mix and sharpen our pricing and being selective about where we play",neg,train
"I think when we’re at ’18, maybe 8 of that or so was coming from BSO and the rest was coming from rates",neg,train
"So, we tried to really look through and capture that",neg,train
"And then just last question in terms of the capital markets business, obviously, it ticked down a little bit this quarter, but from a higher pace over the last couple of quarters, I mean was there something unusually negative in this quarter, I mean, should it bounce back towards that $50 million range or is it just, I’m trying to think of what the outlook is",neg,train
"I mean, I understand the total fee guidance is what it is, but –",neg,train
We’ve got a lot of really positive ground to cover,neg,train
"Our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods will review our results and provide an update on our financial targets",neg,train
And then we're going to open up the call for questions,neg,train
"Also joining us today in the room are Brad Conner, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking",neg,train
"Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 19, 2018  9:00 AM ET",neg,train

"I mean I think when we mentioned last quarter that we expected betas to be lower this quarter, that wasn’t a Fed move",neg,train
We're right on our glide path in terms of where we expected to be on betas,neg,test
"We're in the low-20 on beta, just up a tiny bit from – in 4Q and we expect that to stay in the 20s as we see things progress throughout 2018, maybe getting up towards 30",neg,train
"If we get those two hikes, we'll be more than halfway through an overall tightening cycle and we’ll be about halfway through our overall beta estimate of around 60%",neg,train
And we will go to the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray,neg,train
Page 21 provides some detail on our TOP IV initiatives,neg,train
"We have largely completed the TOP III program, which launched in mid-2016 and we estimate that it has delivered run rate benefits of over $115 million as of the end of 2017",neg,train
Our new TOP IV program is doing very well and we are on track to deliver another $95 million to $110 million of pretext run rate benefit by the end of 2018,neg,train
"On page 7, we present our fourth quarter results, excluding these items",neg,test
"As you can see, we continue to deliver strong results with net income to common of 349 million, up 2% and EPS up 4% linked quarter",neg,train
"We continue to deliver on operating leverage, which came in at 6",neg,train
4% year-over-year with revenue growth close to 8% and expense growth less than 2%,neg,train
We posted another strong quarter from a return perspective with ROTCE of 10,neg,train
Both of these metrics are well ahead of our medium term IPO target,neg,train
These strong results reflect continued execution against our strategic initiatives and our commitment to focus on continuous improvement to drive further revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline,neg,train
Any commentary from you folks and from Don and Brad on loan pricing terms you're seeing in the various categories?,neg,train
We're coming in around 1% for the first quarter and to get to that 4,neg,train
"Can you talk about some of the fee revenue drivers in 2018? I think, you had some pretty big upgrades in the treasury management and mortgage and obviously the mortgage market is a bit influx here with lower refis, but maybe talk about fees in general and then those two specific areas, how meaningful the opportunity could be in those",neg,train
Why don't I start and then John you can provide more of the details,neg,train
But I'd say that we still remain quite positive on the trajectory we've had on the commercial side of the house,neg,train
So we've been adding clients and building up our capabilities so that we can do more for those clients,neg,train
So that's a very strong powerful combination to have broader capabilities and a growing client book,neg,train
"And so if you look probably over the last three years, I think our fees on the commercial side have grown in double digits, low double digits, 11%, 12%, really on the back of capital markets and then also, what we call, global markets, which is FX and interest rate hedging, which we used to do in conjunction with RBS, and we’re able to break that away and set up a great operation on our own",neg,train
"The provision expense, when I look at credit quality, it's been very good and then the guidance for the provision expense for ’18, the range is a little bit higher than what I was looking for and I'm just wondering the reserve build is not a function of keeping reserves to loan ratio fairly steady with the loan growth or would you want to start build building the reserve with more growth on the consumer side?",neg,train
So that investment is not just paying dividends in the mortgage business,neg,train
It’s also in the HELOC business and it will be in all our portfolios,neg,train
And those paydowns drop about a third between ’18 and ’19,neg,train
"So to sum up, page 30, we feel that we've delivered strong results in Q4 and for full year 2017",neg,train

"Next, let's turn to our fourth [ph] quarter outlook on page 26",neg,train
"This is typically a seasonally softer quarter for us, given several factors, including day count, seasonally activity levels and elevated FICA taxes",neg,train
We expect loan growth to come in at about 1% and we should see about a 5 basis point improvement in NIM for the quarter,neg,test
"We're expecting our effective tax rate to come in at about 23% percent, including a small historic tax credit impact",neg,train
"Overall, our view for the quarter reflects continued strong execution against our plan",neg,train
"So, we’ve now been at growing our lending a little bit faster than the industry for quite a number of years",neg,train
"And of course, we have a platform for doing that because we have historically so underpenetrated our own customers’ borrowing behaviors",neg,train
"And so, I think we now have a multiyear track record of achieving above industry growth rates while still getting really good economics",neg,train
"Now, we’ve pointed out for a while that particularly with the shift that began in the third quarter of 2016 to less lending on cobrand products, more lending on proprietary products, those products come with little higher write-off rates and pricing that also is reflective of that risk as well, thereby producing really good economics",neg,train
"Given that’s when we started, we just as you got into the latter part of 2017 are beginning to hit sort of the key seasoning time period in a lot of the new lending that we have taken on and that’s why we have said for almost two years now, we do expect this steady trend upwards in write-off rates and provision",neg,test
"As we look at the great diversity in our lending portfolio, we draw a lot of comfort from the fact that other parts of our portfolio, the cobrand portfolio, some of the lending we do on our charge products or our lending on charge products, you see very little change in the write-off rates",neg,train
"We believe, it’s really important as a company and for our shareholders to show steady earnings growth every year",neg,train
And that comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays,neg,train
And now to the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research,neg,train
"So, if you look at our consumer business, I did point out in my remarks that the highest revenue growth segment in 2017 was the U",neg,train
"And so, even in the face of how competitive the U",neg,train
"consumer segment is, there are some really good results we’re generating and some good opportunities we still have",neg,train
"When you look at the kind of growth we have with small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly outside the U",neg,train
"where we had 20% growth in billings in Q4 and you’ve been in the teens for a number of years now, there are tremendous opportunities to continue to accelerate our growth",neg,test
"And what we felt was the right balance here was the majority of the Tax Act benefits fall through to the bottom line in 2018, but to take a portion and put it for work for the longer term",neg,train
"As we turn to 2018, you may recall that on our Investor Day in March of last year, we expected a decline in the discount rate in 2018 of 2 to 3 basis points",neg,train
"As we look ahead now, we expect a larger year-over-year decline in 2018",neg,train
This stems from the stronger growth we are seeing in places around the world with lower discount rates and also from decisions we have made about how best to grow our overall economics with some of our larger partners,neg,train
Both of these factors are actually part of what will continue to drive the Company’s overall revenue growth,neg,train
And that’s why we think that doing something that we have not previously done a real top up around the world of retirement-oriented profit-sharing plans is a really good thing to do for the long-term wellbeing of our employees,neg,train
"That is a 2017 Q4 period expense and it would not be an expense in 2018, nor do we expect it to necessarily repeat",neg,train
"Taking notes, Craig, to make sure I get all your questions",neg,train
"So, it’s upside to extent the economy strengthens, because of the Tax Act, and we’ll have to see what happens",neg,train
"In terms of the competitive environment, I guess, look, I can speak for our view, Sanjay, which is we have looked at the implications of the Tax Act and we said we should do something for employers, which we did",neg,train
We have to reset our baseline by choosing to invest up to $200 million more in customer-facing growth initiatives this year and we’ve given you clear EPS guidance for 2018,neg,train
"We have to now show you off that 2018 performance that as we get into 2019 and beyond, we can produce the same kind of steady EPS growth that the Company has historically been known for and that’s what we’re very focused on",neg,train
"And that means we are not at all looking to do anything other than use the lower tax rate to produce 2018 performance, a steady growth thereafter",neg,train
"Looking at the segment view on slide four, it is clear that we have strong momentum across our segments",neg,train
"And in the quarter, we saw acceleration in each segment from the Q3 growth rate which further illustrates the diversity of the drivers of our growth",neg,train
And now to line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank,neg,train
Turning next to credit metrics on slide seven where we see the write-off rates for our various portfolios,neg,train
"Starting with the lending portfolio on the left, the loss rate for the quarter was 1",neg,train
"8%, in line with the third quarter and up modestly from the prior year",neg,train
"As we’ve said in the past, we do expect lending write-off rates to continue to increase in large part due to growth in non-cobrand lending products, which have higher loss rates as well as seasoning of the portfolio",neg,train
"On the right side, you can see loss rates in our charge portfolio, as well as the global corporate payments loss ratio",neg,train
"With both, we see relatively stable performance, which we believe reflects the quality of our customer base and a stable economic environment",neg,train
"However, it’s clear that we have made tradeoffs between the components of the spending",neg,train
"Cost of Card Member services increased 39%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and cobrand benefits such as first bag free on Delta as well as usage of the new Uber benefit on Platinum",neg,train
"And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today",neg,train
Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service,neg,train
"So, our total marketing and promotional spending was over $3 billion last year",neg,test
Our total spending on rewards was probably over $7 billion,neg,train
"And then, you’ve got bunch of money we spent on card member services",neg,test
"So, look, $200 million I’m choosing to call out, because as you think about the EPS guidance range we’ve given and certainly had an impact on that EPS guidance range because this was at the margins and decisions we made at the end",neg,train
"And we didn’t have to make it, and we could have given you a little higher EPS guidance range",neg,train
"On the other hand, in the context of all the customer-facing spending that we’re doing on an ongoing basis and plan to do in 2018, it’s a very small number and a very small increment",neg,train
This is about there are incremental things we can do to garner more growth that we weren’t previously doing,neg,train
And that’s really what you will see us targeted at,neg,train
Another important driver to consider for 2018 is our expanded agreements with two important cobrand partners Hilton and Marriott,neg,train
"Looking specifically at 2018, the purchase of the existing Citi/Hilton loan portfolio in the first quarter is expected to drive a little less than 100 basis points of revenue growth for the year",neg,train
"Incremental revenue from other new products we will be introducing, however, will phase in more gradually in future years",neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations Mr",neg,train
"Since the starting point for the stress test is the December 31st balance sheet date, some investors are asking whether your relatively low CET1 starting point of 9% could also hurt your ask in the next -- in the 2018 CCAR cycle",neg,train
"So, our capital ratios are now below the level we had projected in the 2017 CCAR process",neg,train
"And as a result, we do not plan to use our remaining 2017 CCAR buyback authorization for the first half 2018",neg,train
"Of course, most importantly, for the long-term, the new tax law does significantly lower our tax rate going forward, which increases the capital generating power of the business",neg,train
"Given the lower tax rate, we expect that over time, we will more than make up for any reductions in the buyback in 2018 and generate more earnings and return more capital than we would have without tax reform",neg,train
"Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I’ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question",neg,test
"And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions",neg,train
So all of that will lead you in 2018 to continued really good strong growth in net interest income,neg,train
"Now, we’ll come with the same kind of growth in provisions that you saw in 2018 and the combination of those two should continue to produce really good economics for us",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] And first, we go to line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo",neg,test
"5 million new proprietary cards globally in the fourth quarter, 1,000 more new cards than a year ago",neg,train
"First, I wanted to bring to you some of the things that you talked about, Jeff",neg,test
"In terms of the EPS guidance, can you talk about what the two or three biggest swing factors would be that would get you from the top end of the range to the bottom end of the range, just given that the 7% does seem like the range that’s wider than you’ve historically given? And then, just on the renewals, the $200 million pretax impact, is that just a true-up from renewing the contracts and then that goes back down or is there another step-up beyond 2018? Thanks",neg,train
And I just want to end with the emphasis to people that we have a strong track record of being aggressive about returns of capital,neg,train
"We think the best way to get at that is to take a small pause and to do it at a time when if you think about our guidance, it’s producing year-over-year EPS growth somewhere depending on how you want to do the math in the 20% plus range",neg,test
"6 billion charge, you’re correct, the smaller piece is the $600 million piece which is the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset",neg,train
"And as you think about that number going forward, for us, we’re a pretty simple monoline business financially",neg,train
"And so, our net deferred tax position doesn’t change that much from year-to-year, and it actually changes out pretty quickly, it’s mostly driven by things like provision timing and membership rewards",neg,train
"So, there’s not long, multiyear, complicated investments or business impacts on that",neg,train
"As we said before, evolving regulations in Europe and Australia are driving declining network volumes in these geographies",neg,train
"And as a result, we expect our proprietary international billings growth to continue to outpace our network partner billings, which you see again in this quarter’s results",neg,train
"Overall, we are pleased with the billings growth we see across our business segments and geographies",neg,train
"We now start a new chapter in 2018, and of course, starting in February, we will have a new CEO",neg,train
"We are all fortunate to have worked with an incredible leader in Ken Chenault, who has done a remarkable job over his 37 years with the Company",neg,train
"As we now turn the page to Steve Squeri, I would echo what Ken said in his comments in our earnings release, the Company is in very strong hands going forward with our new CEO",neg,train
I’m pleased to be here to recap the strong finish we had to our two-year game plan and to lay out our expectations for 2018,neg,train
"So, if you think about the Q4 results, with the highest revenue growth we’ve seen in quite some time, well, fourth quarter was actually when we already began to lap the Platinum changes",neg,train
"That’s actually why if you do the math of the rewards to billings ratio, while for the last four quarters you’ve seen rewards going faster than billings, that’s because of the Platinum changes",neg,test
"This quarter, it came back down to a much more normalized level where rewards were more consistent with billings",neg,train
"So, the fact that you continue to see strong performance in Platinum, the fact that you did not see any drop off in revenue growth, we feel really good about",neg,train
And to end 2017 despite all the competition that you absolutely do see in the U,neg,train
with a record level of Platinum members in the U,neg,train
And we think we as a result are going into 2018 with great moment around this product,neg,test
"Our growth in total loans was 14% and adjusted for FX, total loans grew at 13% in Q4, as we continue to penetrate the lending opportunity with our existing customers and add new customers",neg,train
"On the right, you can see that net interest yield began to stabilize sequentially in the fourth quarter at 10",neg,train
"Our results in the quarter however are still benefiting from the growth in yield over the prior year, which is a result of the ongoing mix shift of revolving loans towards higher rate buckets and pricing actions we have taken",neg,train
Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir,neg,train
We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today’s discussion,neg,train
"As you look at the adjusted revenue growth trend over the last several quarters, you can very clearly see our success in capturing the growth opportunities we’ve highlighted over the last couple of years",neg,train
"While not on this slide, I would also point out that if you look at our segment results, the highest revenue growth is in our U",neg,train
"And my question was about NIM, you talked about NIM stabilizing",neg,train
"I was just wondering, how do you think about the loan yields going forward with the rate hikes? And then, also, if you could comment on the deposit betas",neg,train
Have you seen anything on the competitive environment there with the deposit rates?,neg,train
"On provision, look, I’m not trying to be quite as precise maybe as you were in the way you’ve phrased the question",neg,train
And yes that will come with provision growth on a percentage basis that is somewhere in the vicinity of what you saw for calendar 2017,neg,train
You look through all that map and it will produce really nice overall economics for us,neg,train
"That’s why, if you think about the history of our Company over many years, that’s why when we have from time-to-time have some kind of sudden financial windfall, upside, better than expected performance",neg,train
"On the deemed repatriations, as everyone knows, one of the in some ways ironies there is you pay out that amount over eight years",neg,test
"And in fact, if you dig into the details, you’ll see that the actual payment of the cash is backend loaded",neg,train
"And yes, from a regulatory capital perspective, we have to book it all upfront and that’s why you have the big hit to regulatory capital upfront in those and actually no cash impact for a while",neg,train
"First, on revenue, look, we’ve put together a plan, as I said in response to an earlier question, based on the world as it existed over the last few months, not necessarily as it has existed since December 22nd when the tax act passed",neg,test
"So, the only two things that are at some point headwinds -- not headwinds, but start to fade a little bit from the revenue growth that you saw in Q4, two things I’ve talked about for a while, which is net interest yield has I think started to hit a little bit of the plateau",neg,train
"It’s still going to show nice year-over-year growth for the first half or so of 2018, but will probably show less year-over-year growth, as you get into the back half",neg,train
"So, that’s a little bit of a moderation of the revenue growth rate",neg,train
"The second thing you’ve heard me talk about for a while is at some point, the changes we made in the U",neg,train
Platinum products way back in 2016 we’ll be done lapping them,neg,train
"Now, we actually started to lap those in Q4, although not the fee -- increased fee in the consumer Platinum and yet we were still at 9%",neg,train
"So, as you heard me say earlier, look, Q4 probably came in a little stronger than we had anticipated",neg,train
I think our 7% to 8% range that we’re giving you guidance for on 2018 is one we’re very comfortable with that we can very confidently hit,neg,train
And our job is to see if we can do any better,neg,train
"So, look, we’ll have to see where the environment goes",neg,train
"I will tell you today, we feel really good about the value propositions we have in the marketplace on the consumer side, on the corporate side, in the U",neg,train
"So that’s what we’re focused on and that’s how we think about it, Sanjay",neg,test
So to the extent that tax reform does help the economy and we certainly believe along the long run,neg,train
"What that means for 2018 is probably a little secure, that will clearly be a good thing for us",neg,train
"And look, we ended Q4, I will say, with a little bit more momentum on the revenue side than we probably had originally anticipated",neg,train
"But actually, it grew 6% this quarter, which is the highest growth rate we’ve had in a while",neg,train
"And if you dig through the tables, you see -- in our earnings release, you’ll see that for the company T&E spending sequentially strengthened a little bit",neg,train
"On the discount rate, as you look sort of further out, has the kind of base case of down 2 or 3 bps changed to where it’s structurally higher or is 2018 just kind of based on some moves you’ve made?",neg,train
"So, we have line of sight into what we think is going to happen in 2018, both on revenue and we feel about the guidance of 7% to 8%, and on discount rate",neg,train
Beyond that we will have to see what decisions make sense to drive the best overall economics for the Company,neg,train
"So, some of those things will clearly pay over time",neg,train
"The impact of regulation in Australia and Europe which we’ve been going through for -- in the case of Europe, a couple of years now; in the case of Australia, really just began again in July last year, those will fade a little bit over time",neg,train
"I’ll review marketing and promotion, rewards and card member services expenses as part of our card member engagement discussion on the next page",neg,train
"Total operating expenses were down 2% from the prior year, as we continue to see the benefit of our cost reduction efforts",neg,test
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call",neg,train
"At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today’s call is being recorded",neg,train
"Now, of course, beyond these core focus areas of business growth, 2018 will also benefit from a lower corporate tax rate, which I will come back to in discussing our 2018 guidance as we wrap up the call",neg,train
"So, we sort of built our plan over the last few months based on a view of the economy probably as it existed prior to the passage of the tax bill",neg,train
"So, mechanically, the reality is, we have not built into our plan any expectation that there is a stronger economy in the U",neg,train
or anywhere else in the world for that matter than what people thought prior to the passage of tax reform,neg,train
"And now, to line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse",neg,train
And now to line of Ken Bruce from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"So, turning now to slide 11 we’ll look discount rate",neg,train
The discount rate in the second half of 2017 was 2,neg,train
"So, ratio of discount revenue to billed business was 1",neg,train
"These changes within the range of our expectations, which we shared with you at our last Investor Day and which are shown on the right side of slide 11",neg,train
"First, I think it’s important to remember, the end objective here is to drive revenue growth",neg,train
"And we feel really good about the acceleration in revenue growth that we have achieved over the last two years and the fourth quarter results of 9%, the highest we’ve shown in many years",neg,train
And we did that with some significant declines in the discount rate above that historical 2% to 3% range,neg,test
One other question on the $200 million or upto $200 million of customer-facing spending,neg,train
"I’m just wondering what sort of timing you might expect for that, will you frontend load it or kind of have it evenly over the year? And are you factoring in what competitors may or may not do? Will that affect how much you spend if they’re aggressive on things like promotion and…",neg,train
And I think we will very quickly get on to the positive side of the one-time charge that we in return for a much lower tax rate going forward,neg,train
"Due to the Tax Act impact, of course, we ended the quarter with a net loss",neg,test
"The net loss combined with growth in the balance sheet and continued capital returns in Q4, resulted in a decline in our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9",neg,train
"For perspective, adjusted for the Tax Act impact, our common equity Tier 1 ratio would have been approximately 200 basis points higher",neg,test
"I am hoping you might be willing to unpack the provision growth commentary a little bit, just in terms of what you are expecting in terms of the absolute rise in losses relative to the reserve building",neg,train
It’s a pretty substantial growth that you are kind of pointing to on the provisions,neg,train
"So, I just want to make sure I understand that",neg,train
"In many ways, I think, I would go back a little bit to Sanjay’s question, which is, when you look at our performance in 2017, the plan we have articulated for you this evening is really one, which is just a continuation of the momentum that we have today with the lower tax rate put on it and the impact of Marriott and Hilton, and the decision to step-up investment a little bit",neg,train
"So, the plan doesn’t assume any particular greater strength in the economy",neg,train
What I said in my remarks is as you think about 2018 I think our ability to sequentially keep growing the net interest yield is probably about at a plateau,neg,train
"Although, if you look at full year 2018 results, there will still be some year-over-year growth, because what I’m telling you is we’re plateauing kind of at Q4 levels",neg,train
"And in fact, the first part of 2017 was below that if you do a little bit of seasonal adjusting",neg,train
And now to line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs,neg,train
"Rewards expense growth in the quarter was 12%, just slightly above the 11% growth in proprietary billings as we lapped changes to the U",neg,train
We continue to be pleased with our Platinum product performance in the U,neg,train
", we finished 2017 with our highest ever number of Platinum members and record levels of spend",neg,test
"So, consistent with our long history of balancing short, medium and long-term objectives, we now plan to invest up to $200 million more in customer-facing growth initiatives in 2018 than we had originally planned prior to the passage of tax",neg,train
"As the remaining tax benefits, we’ll build capital and support earnings growth in 2018",neg,train
All of these lead us to an earnings per share range of $6,neg,train
"Of course, there remains a lot of work to do in 2018 to deliver in this range, but our focus is to deliver against the plans we have set",neg,train
We will continue to evaluate the implications of the Tax Act as guidance and interpretations evolve,neg,test
6 billion and tax-related charges caused us to report a quarterly loss on a GAAP basis,neg,train
"Excluding this amount, adjusted net income for the quarter was $1",neg,train
4 billion and earnings per share for Q4 was a $1,neg,test
"Discount revenue was up 8%, driven by the strong growth in billed business",neg,train
"Net card fees growth was 8%, driven by strong performance in the Platinum and Delta portfolios and growth in key international markets",neg,train
Other fees and commissions grew 17% and 12% on an FX adjusted basis,neg,train
The weaker dollar had a larger impact on this line,neg,train
And other revenues declined 13% in the quarter though primarily driven by prior year revenue from a small business that we sold in Q4 last year,neg,train
"Net interest income was up 23%, driven by the higher net interest yield and loan growth that I spoke about a few minutes ago",neg,test
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
"As you would expect, in today’s competitive cobrand environment, the margins are lower on these partnerships, starting in January",neg,train
"And as a result, we expect to the overall impact of these renewals to reduce 2018 pretax earnings by more than $200 million versus 2017",neg,train
"To be very clear, these agreements generate attractive economics under the new terms, even though the margins are lower than before",neg,train
I think the main thing that I worry about in terms of anything that could put you more towards the lower end are really the standard external factors,neg,train
"I think other than that, as I said, the guidance we’ve given you is just a continuation of the performance",neg,train
"So, I just want to confirm one that you are guiding toward 36% year-on-year growth in the provision for 2018",neg,train
"And secondly, Platinum, the changes you’ve made to Platinum obviously spurred some very aggressive growth and that’s good to see",neg,train
"Are you seeing any tail-offs in that momentum going into 2018, or should we expect another very strong year for Platinum growth? And have you seen any reactions from competitors to the more experiential benefits you put on that card?",neg,train
"So, I think, as we think about net interest yield, we have had a pretty good run over the last five or six quarters as we have evolved a little bit, our mix of customers, as we have taken some thoughtful pricing actions where we could, and as interest rates have edged up a little bit while the portion of our funding stack that comes from our personal savings program was acting with the beta of about 0",neg,train
"So, all of those things have given us a really nice sequential run",neg,train
"I think, the really important thing to think about here is we run the Company for the long-term",neg,train
"And in the long-term, the lower tax rate is going to produce much higher earnings, much higher capital generation and therefore much higher capital returns than otherwise",neg,train
"In the long run, we need to get back to whatever the, as fed regulatory environment involves, whatever the appropriate steady state capital ratio is at any given point in time",neg,train
6 billion charge we took is how quickly or in what pattern you get back to that steady state capital level,neg,train
"And so, we could have continued to repurchase shares in the first half of 2018 and then what you would have seen is a lower result as we go through the CCAR 2018 process",neg,train
"Our decision, which we feel very confident in, was no, look, let’s just very quickly rebuild the capital that of course will be built into the CCAR 2018 process",neg,train
"So, this will we think produce in fact a much stronger CCAR 2018 result than if we chose to spread out a reduction in our share repurchases",neg,train
"And look, we’ll have to see how the fed’s thinking evolves because we’re not the only CCAR participant in this situation",neg,train
We will have to see how the rating agency thinking evolves,neg,train
"Now, why did that happen? Well, because we are very consciously making some decisions that we think drive more revenue growth but also have the impact of bringing that discount rate down",neg,train
"through the OptBlue program and some similar programs around the globe, some decisions we have made about how to best gain overall economics with some of our larger partners that had a positive impact on revenue and a more challenging impact on the discount rate, and of course regulation in certain places around the globe such as Australia, are doing some things to drive the discount rates down but also creating some opportunities for the kind of growth in our proprietary business that I talked about in my prepared remarks, in Australia and the UK for example which are both in the high teens",neg,test
"Provision expense for the quarter was $833 million, up 33%",neg,train
The growth in provision this quarter is in line with what we saw year-to-date through the third quarter and our comment on last quarter’s earnings call,neg,train
"Our absolute growth in net interest income well exceeds the growth in provision, and net interest income remains just 20% of our total revenues",neg,train
"If you look at deposit betas, so fed’s now done five rate hikes; if you look at our personal savings program, our beta to date, if you will, is about 0",neg,train
"As we have for a while for forward planning purposes, we assume a beta of 0",neg,train
If we can keep the beta a little bit below the 0,neg,train
"7 level, then interest rates going up ceases to be much of a headwind, and of course, the betas that we’d had thus far is mostly a tailwind",neg,train
"American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 18, 2018  5:00 PM ET",neg,train
"Jeff, I wonder if we could talk a little bit about some of the customer-facing initiatives that you’re planning on using some of the tax windfall for the 200 million that you referenced in the press release and talked a little bit about",neg,train
"Be interested in understanding corporate customer-facing initiatives versus consumer and perhaps, you could give us a sense as to whether this is pulling forward what you already have been planning or is there something plus something new here that you’re considering with this 200 million?",neg,train
"Our global commercial and global consumer segments were roughly the same size, representing 40% and 43% of billings respectively",neg,train
Global network services makes up the remaining 17% of billings,neg,test
"Today’s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter’s results through the series of presentation slides",neg,train
"Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session",neg,train
"So having a little bit lower tax rate in all those models doesn’t actually cause us Sanjay to think differently or to invest more, because we’re still focused on short versus long-term",neg,train

"Moving now to our metrics, starting with billed business performance trends, which you see several views of, on slides three through five",neg,train
"Before we get into the details, I would quickly point out that reported billings growth was 11% in the quarter, our first double-digit billings growth quarter in some time",neg,train
What you see on slide three is billings accelerated to 9% in the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis,neg,train
"Finally, as we thought about our overall tax position and the implications of the new Tax Act, we certainly broadly believe the new tax law is positive for the U",neg,train
We have reached a series of conclusions and decisions around this,neg,test
"First, while we are still evaluating recently released interpretations of the new tax law, we expect an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 22% before discrete items",neg,train
"Third, as we thought about our overall tax position and how to manage the impact from a Tax Act, we focused on three key constituents",neg,train
"And so, in summary, 2017 was a very strong year for the Company",neg,train
"We have come a long ways since early 2016, when we set the objective of delivering at least $5",neg,train
Our strong 2017 performance sets the foundation for our 2018 expectations as we introduce a 2018 EPS guidance range of $6,neg,train
The outlook is based on the current economic and regulatory climate,neg,test
I think you exited the year with the revenue growth FX adjusted at 9%,neg,train
I think you called out an additional 100 basis-point lift from the acquisition of the Hilton related receivables from Citi,neg,train
But you’re guiding to 7% to 8% for next year,neg,test
"Is it just an inherent conservatism in that or are there some specific headwinds you have in mind? And then, just to clarify the comments around the contributions to profit share",neg,train
"I think you indicated, you made some contributions in December but then talked about it in the context of the 2018 guidance",neg,train
Is there more coming in 2018 and did you quantify that at all? Thanks,neg,test
"You’ve seen that pattern several times with Delta, you’ve seen it with some of the hotel partners before",neg,train
"And to be very clear, as I said in my remarks, you still have very attractive economics for us but not as attractive as they generally are in the very last year, what was the prior contract",neg,train
"So, over $200 million impact to PTI in 2018 is one of the hurdles that we have to overcome as we think about our EPS growth in 2018; it goes away in 2019",neg,train
"Just like our decision do a little bit of incremental investing, because of the Tax Act, it’s really a one-time resetting of the baseline, and I wouldn’t anticipate that same kind of increase in 2019 or beyond",neg,train
"Next, let me talk a little about lending, building on the comments I made earlier",neg,train
Net interest yield has started to stabilize but is expected to still contribute to growth versus prior year,neg,train
These dynamics together should again drive strong growth in net interest income as well as growth in provision for loss similar to the growth rate in 2017,neg,train
"And as a result, we again expect significant growth in the economics of the loan portfolio",neg,train
"Over the last few years, we’ve steadily returned capital to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs which continued through the fourth quarter as we returned $1",neg,test
"For the year, while we returned a 190% of the capital we generated, adjusted for the Tax Act impact, our payout ratio would have been about 100%",neg,train
And now to line of Chris Donat from Sandler O’Neill,neg,train
"With that, let me turn to the results, starting on slide two, where you see revenues in Q4 of $8",neg,train
"8 billion, growing at 9% adjusted for FX, reflecting accelerated growth in billings and continued strong growth in loans and fees",neg,train
Net income and EPS for the quarter were both impacted by the passage of the Tax Act,neg,train
"And as I mentioned a moment ago, to provide a bit more detail, we recognized the Tax Act impact in the quarter of $2",neg,train
"First, given the global nature of our business, we recognized approximately $2 billion of taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings; and second, we recognized a roughly $600 million charge related to the remeasurement of our U",neg,train
net deferred tax assets to the lower rate of 21%,neg,train
"6 billion represents our current estimate, which is slightly higher than the estimate we previously disclosed",neg,train
"Represented by the first three columns of the chart, our global commercial segment includes our small and midsized enterprise customers or SMEs as well as our large and global corporate customers",neg,train
"As a reminder, SMEs represent one of our highest growth areas, and you see that again this quarter with U",neg,train
SME billings growing at 9% and international SME billings accelerating to 20% on an FX adjusted basis,neg,train
"The large and global customer segment grew 6% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter, up a bit sequentially from last quarter",neg,train
And I would note that we also saw some sequential improvement in the overall T&E billings growth rate this quarter,neg,train
"With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff",neg,test
Let me pause here and make some final comments on our $1 billion cost reduction exercise,neg,train
"When we started this program in early 2016, we laid out specific plans to drive cost savings",neg,train
And I am pleased to report that we have successfully executed on these plans,neg,train
"We have driven savings through headcount reductions, vendor negotiations, process changes, expense policy changes and many other initiatives",neg,train
"Throughout the year, as our business performance started to outpace our own plans, we took the opportunity to use some of these savings to selectively reinvest in the business, including in particular some incremental spending on sales force and technology which are part of our operating expenses",neg,train
"I would also point that in fourth quarter, we made an incremental contribution to our employee profit-sharing program of a little bit more than a $100 million related in part to our overall tax position in light of the new tax law and also the strong performance of the Company",neg,test
"So, maybe focusing on the revenue side of maybe where the benefits might reside from tax reform",neg,train
"Adjusted revenue growth accelerated steadily through the year, starting at 7% in Q1 and ending at 9% in Q4",neg,train
Our reported growth rate for the full year of course includes in the comparison two quarters of revenue related to the Costco relationship in the prior year,neg,train
"As you can see on the right side of slide two, full year earnings per share adjusted for the tax charges is $5",neg,train
And now to line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"Let me provide a little perspective on the drivers behind our expectations, which are summarized in slide 15",neg,train
"As I mentioned earlier, we do expect the discount rates to decline, but to also see continued momentum in other areas like card fee growth",neg,train
"As we look at all the moving pieces, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 7% to 8%",neg,train
We see 8% growth in the quarter and we are pleased by the acceleration and growth from Q3,neg,train
International proprietary consumer continues to perform particularly strong with growth of 14% on an FX adjusted basis,neg,train
"Once again, we see robust proprietary growth in markets such as the UK, up 19%; Japan and Australia, up 16% each; and Mexico, up 13% on FX adjusted basis",neg,train
"And finally, our network business is up 6% on an FX adjusted basis",neg,train

"Jeff, with respect to the tax side of things, I mean, the actual DTA write-down was smaller I guess than we had thought",neg,train
It feels like that’s going to take bunch of years for that tax benefit to be recovered,neg,train
"So, kind of coming at the capital kind of question, a slightly different way, I mean, how should we think about what to expect post 2017 CCAR as you go into 2018, and I guess also recognizing that loan growth that you’ve put on in the last year probably has higher stressed losses as well? So, may be kind of walk through that",neg,train
"As you can see in this afternoon’s earnings release, like all U",neg,train
"companies, our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results reflect some onetime impacts stemming from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act",neg,train
"Adjusted for the impact of the Tax Act, which I will come back to in a minute, we earned $1",neg,train
"87 for the full year, in line with the increased guidance we gave at the end of Q3 when we said we expected to earn between $5",neg,train
"Just as important as these EPS outcomes was the strong momentum we continued to see in the business, with success executing against each of the three priorities we set out in our game plan at the beginning of 2016, accelerating revenue growth; optimizing our investments; and resetting our cost base",neg,test
"In fact, billings and revenue growth reached multiyear highs in Q4 2017",neg,train
And we are particularly pleased with the diversity of the drivers of our growth and the linkage between the many changes and investments we have made over the last couple of years and where we now see growth,neg,train

"Well, so I think the organic growth for us is a function of two things",neg,train
"I think the economy is going to be growing faster because of the tax changes and to be honest, the reduction in regulatory constraints out in the marketplace, so that the market growth is driven by taxes and less regulation",neg,train

And our next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research,neg,train
"Turning to slide 11, the reported net interest margin was 3",neg,train
The decline in GAAP and core margin reflects a 2,neg,train
"1 billion increase in securities, lower security yields due to duration adjustments and spread compression between loan yields and product costs",neg,train
GAAP margin also includes expected reduction in purchase accounting benefit,neg,test
"Deposit betas continue to be very modest, with most of the increase coming from commercial deposits",neg,train
Asset sensitivity declined slightly due to an increase in fixed rate assets,neg,train
We’ve had a strong year in ’17 that continue in ’18,neg,test
Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
"In the auto case, frankly, we believe we're going to be very soon moving back to a more traditional auto pricing program like we had before",neg,train
That will increase that volume in to auto portfolio and the spreads will remain good,neg,train
"In the mortgage business, we've simply run off the lower yielding part of that and we've expanded and diversified this organic growth and acquisitions on a national basis, so that we're able to get the volumes that allow the portfolio to grow at acceptable returns",neg,train
"So, we did have a decline in retail of 4",neg,train
I would point out that we are nearing the end of this optimization process,neg,train
We expect retail runoff to begin to stabilize and grow in the first quarter from -- primarily from the mortgage area,neg,train
"And in the second quarter, we expect the auto portfolio to turn",neg,train
"So, kind of by the end of the first half, we’ll be clearly growing both of our portfolios and then our blended average will be somewhere between the first and second quarter",neg,train
But the main thing is the pain of most of that is over,neg,test
"John, what you don’t know is we put our 2000 plan together",neg,train
Kelly challenged all the business units to basically cut across the board and what we did as a management team is reallocate all the inappropriate investments,neg,train
"Greetings, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the BB&T Corporation Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
"Continuing on slide 16, average loans declined 672 million, mostly due to planned runoff in mortgage and auto",neg,train
We put plans in place during the fourth quarter to stabilize these portfolios,neg,train
We expect mortgage to stabilize in the first quarter and auto to stabilize in the second quarter of this year,neg,test
Deposit balances have been relatively stable and deposit costs relatively unchanged over last year,neg,train
"Turning to slide 19, financial services and commercial finance net income was 136 million, up 24 million",neg,train
Noninterest income increased 26 million due to across the board fee income gains,neg,train
"Noninterest expense was up 11 million, mostly due to higher incentives",neg,train
Strong growth in institutional and retail invested assets resulted in more than 12% annualized growth versus third quarter,neg,train
"Continuing on slide 12, our fee income ratio was 42",neg,train
"There was a broad based increase in the quarter, including commission based fees, which impacted personnel costs that we would talk about shortly",neg,train
"Insurance income was up 21 million, mostly driven by seasonality",neg,train
"Investment banking and brokerage had a strong quarter, up 8 million",neg,train
The increase of other income reflected another strong quarter for private equity investments of 13 million,neg,test
"Turning to slide 17, community bank commercial net income was 233 million, an increase of 3 million from last quarter",neg,train
"Net interest income increased 5 million, mostly due to growth in CRE and demand deposits",neg,test
"We had good increase in our commercial pipeline, which was up 20%",neg,train
We also saw record loan production due to strong business demand and tax exempt production,neg,train
"Non- interest expense was down 20 million, mostly due to higher capitalized salaries",neg,test
"Turning to slide 21, insurance holdings and premium finance net income totaled 33 million, up 15 million",neg,test
"Noninterest income totaled 428 million, up 27 million mostly driven by seasonality in P&C commissions",neg,train
"8%, mostly due to increased new business and higher retention",neg,train
"Noninterest expense was up, mostly due to the one-time bonus",neg,train
"In summary, we had very strong fourth quarter earnings, positive adjusted operating leverage for both linked and like quarter, excellent credit quality and good expense control",neg,train
Our new platform continues to be one of the very best in the business today,neg,train
We continue to invest in it on a regular basis,neg,train
That’s the exactly the way to think about it and we didn’t just start yesterday,neg,train
We started early in ’17 with an enhanced internal program,neg,test
"We now are going to announce some kind of a big program, call it, whatever you want to call it",neg,train
"So, we've approached it with the same kind of intensity in terms of restructuring our business",neg,train
"What you saw in the fourth quarter, we reduced our associates by like 800 people",neg,train
"So, you know that we are restructuring the business pretty substantially and we’re simply reinvesting that in the business",neg,train
It's the elimination of the drag that we've had and the dilutive investments we’ve made in newer markets,neg,train
"Those will be getting better in all respects, including retail",neg,train
It is the elimination of the drag from auto and mortgage that Clarke has described and it is just frankly making the business more productive,neg,train
"We've been basically driving that from an executive point of view with one person overseeing and driving the entire retail bank, I mean, the entire community bank",neg,test
"So, Erika, first of all, I personally don’t know that the 250 is going to make it through",neg,train
"There are a lot of people talking, including us that it would be better not to do the 250 and rather than going to a brighter line, rather move to where institutions are based on the inherent risk in the business, which has been a lot of work done by the Fed on already",neg,train
"But if it does, it won't change the way we run our business",neg,train
We're not going to run our business based on whether we're 249 or 251,neg,train
They're not dramatic changes for our business once we go over 250,neg,train
"The reason you haven't heard as much about this and some mergers, remember, when we were doing most of our mergers for all the years, the whole economy was running and gunning",neg,train
"So you could do a merger, you could go through what I call the thermal process where you go through the dilution and restructuring of the portfolios, but it didn't show up because the rest of the whole market was growing so fast",neg,train
"They are improving dramatically, but they were still a drag in ’17",neg,train
"Our BSA program was a drag, which is by the way [indiscernible]",neg,train
So let me turn it to Daryl now to give you some more detail on the performance areas,neg,train

"Turning to slide 13, adjusted noninterest expense, excluding restructuring charges and actions taken to the tax reform, was slightly under 1",neg,train
"7 billion, down 1 million from last quarter's adjusted expense",neg,train
"This included a 36 million one-time bonus payment and 100 million charitable contribution, which will be invested in our communities in the coming years",neg,train
"Looking to the first quarter, we expect total loans to be 1% to 3% annualized, linked quarter; net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy and the loan loss provision to match net charge-offs plus loan growth; GAAP margin to be down 1 to 3 basis points, with core margin stable compared to fourth quarter due to the adjustment on tax exempt assets from the new corporate tax rate change; fee income to be up 1% to 3% versus like quarter; expenses to be flat versus like quarter, excluding merger related and restructuring charges and other onetime items and effective tax rate of about 21%",neg,train
"Second question is this, you said that you're near your -- the end of your investments into the Pennsylvania franchise",neg,train
And I guess what are we two or three years down the road to I guess,neg,train
"Are you going to get what you want from that acquisition, which was somewhat controversial at the time? When you look back on it, are you going to get what you thought you were going to get?",neg,train
And so we see those as being really good downside kind of protection for us and good growth rates,neg,train
Our next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James,neg,train
"Just wanted to get a sense on what would drive the charge-offs guidance that you gave from the low end to the high end, because it seems like, as you guys derisk the portfolio that charge-offs are coming towards the lower end",neg,test
"And as we move forward, with tax reform, maybe, some of your customers might be performing better",neg,train
So how should we think longer term about your credit trends?,neg,train
"Continuing to slide 18, average loan balances were up slightly compared to last quarter, however, ending loan balances increased 925 million, reflecting strong loan growth near the end of the quarter",neg,train
"So I was just wondering, is your expectation that you're going to fight to keep expenses flattish in ‘19 as well?",neg,train
"Our C&I is growing really, really well, particularly in the larger end through our corporate strategy, which has really been robust performance for the last several years and we really are still seeing lots of opportunities across the country, where we just still don't have regional representation",neg,train
"So C&I national business, our equipment national business, our mortgage business is expending more nationally",neg,test
"Remember, we've opened new markets at Texas and Pennsylvania, et cetera and we haven’t fully built out those areas yet",neg,train
So those women Jenna was let me like Christmas on a more specific areas of research you are some of the general ones,neg,train
Let me let Chris point some of the more specific areas that we’re seeing,neg,train
"Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining us on our call",neg,train
"We had a really strong quarter, record adjusted net income available to shareholders, which was very balanced led by record revenues, good expense controls, stellar asset quality and really good growth in core loans",neg,train
"And the second question, Kelly, I heard your comment saying that you're very focused on organic growth and I'm just wondering how that translates into how you think about both, the tax implications and organic and capital return and this year CCAR",neg,train
"Can you just kind of help us frame, if the focus is on organic, what do you anticipate in terms of the tax benefits for how you think about CCAR and any changes to that thinking in a general sense? Thanks",neg,train
"So, John, if you look at our slide deck, on page 5 in there, Kelly went through and mentioned that, we basically should have reported and all the adjustments coming through",neg,train
"If you look at the very last column on that page, it’s the full year, for 2017, the total noninterest expense is 6",neg,train
"If you see that, that's the base that we're talking about, being flat on a year-over-year basis",neg,train
"I’m going to talk about credit quality, net interest margin, fee income, non-interest expense, capital or segment results and provide some guidance for first quarter and full year 2018",neg,train
"And then a follow-up question is on – Kelly, you touched on your betas, they’re quite low",neg,train
"You don't expect them to rise meaningfully, if there isn't a significant increase in loan demand",neg,train
"Can you guys share with us the difference in the betas though within the customer base, the consumer deposits tend to have the lowest betas versus the commercial deposits and the high net worth? How does yours differ between the different segments?",neg,test
"If you look at full year, our adjusted EPS was $3",neg,train
"So if you look at the adjusted ROA, ROCE and ROTCE respectively, they were 1",neg,train
We’re very pleased we had a positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for both like and linked quarter,neg,train
"Can you guys give us an update on your BSA/AML work with the regulators, where do you stand on that and how this is progressing?",neg,train
I think the biggest factor that would change the point and the range would be how fast we change the mix,neg,train
"And I would also say the whole industry is operating at a very, very low, probably below trend line level in a very benign environment",neg,train
"And maybe my last -- other question would be if you had to think about an area of focus where you thought you could maybe exceed the guidance that you've laid out in the presentation, where do you think that would be? I mean, could loan growth end up being significantly better if we get an uptick in the economy or could your NIM move higher, like, maybe restructuring, becoming more asset sensitive or even do you think you could see actual net reductions in expenses? Are there any of those areas where you think you could maybe exceed what you're putting out there today?",neg,train
Let me remind you that BB&T does not provide public earnings predictions or forecasts,neg,train
"However, there may be statements made during the course of this call that express management's intentions, beliefs or expectations",neg,train
BB&T's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements,neg,train
Please refer to the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information in our presentation and our SEC filings,neg,train
"If you look at some of the numbers on page 3, you will see that net income available to common shareholders totaled 614 million, which was up 3",neg,train
"7% versus the fourth quarter ’16, but adjusted net income because of a number of changes, which we’ll cover with you, was a record 671 million, up 11",neg,train
"This is a core part of our bears, I’d say the amount of positive growth trajectory as far as I can see",neg,train
"So obviously, if we were not making those expenses, investments and our expenses would be down",neg,train
"If you're tracking in the deck and on page four, we just wanted to share some of the detail in terms of some of the changes we made with regard to the tax reform benefit",neg,train
"You probably saw we did increase our charitable contribution by 100 million on pretax, which will be invested over time into our communities",neg,train
"We did reevaluate our deferred income taxes, investments in affordable housing projects",neg,train
That was a plus $43 million on a tax basis,neg,train
"Continuing on slide 10, our allowance coverage ratio remains strong at 2",neg,train
"Excluding the acquired portfolio, the allowance to loans ratio was 1",neg,train
We recorded a provision of 138 million compared to net charge-offs of 130 million,neg,test
"So right now, we are solidly capitalized at a 10% common equity tier 1",neg,train
There is some opportunity as time goes on and things stabilize to decrease that,neg,train
"So, as the economy gets better, as organic growth increases, as earnings increase, that just augurs for better capital deployment coming to the CCAR process",neg,train
"7%, but importantly, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 57",neg,train
3% in the third and I would point out that's the best adjusted efficiency ratio we've had in three years,neg,train
"Also, I would point out that our adjusted non-interest expenses totaled 1",neg,train
"Not a huge decrease, but a decrease, so, a turn as we’ve indicated",neg,train
"But look, the mergers, Nancy, have been around a long time, like I have and I’ve been around longer than you Nancy, I’m not trying",neg,train
"If you look at page 8, I just point out that DDA continues to do great, growing 5",neg,train
Our percentage of DDA to total deposits was up 34,neg,train
"I’ll just remind you that if you go back over about last 15 year, our DDA has gone up from about 14% to 15% to 34%, growing from the last end of the peer group to top",neg,train
"So, huge improvement in our balance sheet restructuring over these years in the product category and the loan category, all of that has taken a lot of work, but has worked out very, very well",neg,train
I would point out that our betas in deposit are low at 15% on interest deposits and 8% on total deposits,neg,train
"Also, I would point out that you – I mentioned that we had some changes in our accounting presentation with regard to our loan portfolio",neg,train
"The backdrop of that is we are really doubling down on our community bank, we think, Main Street is coming back",neg,train
It’s time to get substantially more performance out of the community bank,neg,train
We are reinvesting in the items I outlined that results in a flat expense structure for ’18,neg,test
"So, certainly through ’18 and ‘19, I see a continuation of the same trend, it may even be longer than that, but certainly for those two years, I see that",neg,train
"Anthony, if you would come back on the line and explain how our listeners may participate in the session?",neg,train
"As Daryl said, we did have a strong quarter of positive adjusted operating leverage",neg,test
Our adjusted EPS was up 15% versus fourth quarter ’16,neg,train
We had a lot of headwinds that are turning into tailwinds,neg,train
"There will be less taxes, there will be less regulation",neg,train
"So, while we've had a good performance in community bank, the time is right to really substantiate in that point of the community bank, because it's getting ready to really take off, given the changes in the marketplace",neg,train
"And then wondering if you could touch quickly on sort of the trajectory for NIM in 2018, I understand there's a bunch of moving pieces, sort of with and without rates, but just generally speaking is it your expectation that core NIM can stay relatively stable, a hike or two this year",neg,train
"And then just as a follow-up, the outlook for the positive operating leverage also sounds good",neg,train
"What would it take to kind of get to the higher end of that, what would we have to assume to kind of be at the higher end of the revenue growth and operating leverage goal for the year?",neg,train
"I mean, basically, we've done everything that we have been expected to do that we think we should do in terms of building a very robust BSA/AML, kind of state-of-the-art system",neg,train
"It's been a very expensive process, we’ve used a lot of outside contractors, consultants",neg,train
"But it's built out, it's running fine and so we're now just in the process of working with the regulators in terms of how much time they want to see it run well before they lift the consent order",neg,train
"So, obviously, we don't control that, but as far as what we have to do, we think we’ve substantially done everything we need to do",neg,train
"Daryl, I was wondering on the expense outlook, for keeping expenses flat",neg,train
"I was wondering, off of what base should we look for that to be flat? I guess that would be kind of the adjusted basis about 6",neg,train
"65, is that the number that we should look for that to be off of? And then that excludes kind of merger and intangibles, so just kind of what's outside of that number that we should think about?",neg,train
"Continuing on slide 20, we had strong loan growth, led by equipment finance, government finance and wealth",neg,train
"Deposit growth improved, led by money market and savings balances",neg,train
"Interest bearing deposit cost rose 8 basis points, due to the rate sensitive nature of these clients",neg,train
"We’re seeing really good growth in Houston, Dallas, Alabama and South Florida, really good growth",neg,train
"So if you look at all five of those, they were pretty substantial and to have the kind of returns we had, dealing with those key strategic changes that that we needed to work through is pretty spectacular",neg,train
"Now, the good news is, as you look in to ’18, all of those five headwinds in ’17 become tailwinds in ’18",neg,train
"So, Main Street is getting better, Pennsylvania is getting substantially down and productivity is up high percentages, bond portfolio optimization is basically over",neg,train
"The BSA program, in terms of investment expenses, is basically over",neg,train
I would tell you that we're basically going to just hold tight,neg,train
We don't have any plans for 2018 to expand securities,neg,train
"So with securities flat, loan growth up in the 2% to 4%, you should have earning assets up about 3% or so",neg,train
Our next question comes from Matt O’Connor with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"Personnel costs included a decline of 16 million due to lower salary expense, equity based comp and higher capitalized salaries, partially offset by higher performance based incentives of about 19 million",neg,train
"Outside IT and professional services were up, due to higher consulting and contracting expenses across several projects",neg,train
"It is also worth noting occupancy and equipment expense declined, reflecting solid progress on consolidating back office locations and branch closures",neg,train
"Over the years, we’ve spent a lot of time with regard to mergers",neg,train
"We haven’t officially listed out, but it kind of doesn't matter",neg,train
"We're not focused on mergers and we're getting really, really good benefits from that",neg,train
"And in addition to doing all of that, we [indiscernible] and so that shows you that we're doing what we said",neg,train
We're preparing for the future and we're very excited about the future,neg,train
"We get feedback on a consistent basis whether they are on the client care center, in the branches or wherever they're visiting us, we get feedback so that we can respond to any challenges that they have",neg,train
"Sorry to beat a dead horse on the reinvestment of the tax windfall and sort of the unit play on cost, but just kind of want to understand the numbers around it a little bit better",neg,train
"So, I think you said at a conference or I think maybe on this call as well that about a third would be -- of the windfall would be reinvested and you've been doing about, I think, last year, you did about 4 billion of pretax earnings, the tax reform will reduce your tax rate by about 10 percentage points",neg,train
"So that comes out to like 400 million, so a third would be 130 million, 135 million in terms of how much is actually reinvested",neg,train
Is that sort of the right way to think about it in terms of the parameters around how much the magnitude of dollar reinvestment and benefits that you get?,neg,train
We will be referencing a slide presentation during today’s comments,neg,train
A copy of the presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the BB&T website,neg,train
"Erika, as I said then that I thought this was early on remember, but I did say conceptually, to me, it made sense to think about investing about a third in the business, about a third in terms of dividend increases and about a third just kind of falling through to the shareholder through the bottom line",neg,test
"Now, for clarity, all of that is incorporated in an expected flat expense structure",neg,train
I'm curious is that just more of what probably we’re just speaking to of the near prime auto or are there other initiatives within retail that you'll focus on more fully or again is it just maybe not the drag that you've had over the last two years in mortgage and auto,neg,train
"Obviously as Kelly said, we're close to the end AML/BSA",neg,test
"So with the rate increase that we had in December, if we didn't have a corporate tax rate change, we would have adjusted our guidance by 4 basis points, because the lower tax rate -- corporate tax rate basically brought down GAAP and core margin 4 basis points this month, starting in January",neg,train
So we guided to a flat core would have been up 4 basis points from that perspective,neg,train
Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America,neg,train
"And then just finally on the revenue guide, 2% to 4%, how should we think about how that breaks out more or less between non-interest income and NII?",neg,train
"And so because the market itself was getting too unprofitable, because the structure that we went to based on CFPB guidance, both of those combined, drove the volume down in auto",neg,train
"I mean, the returns were just not satisfactory and we’re more focused on capital optimization for our shareholders and we are growing",neg,train
And so we pulled back and made our structure so that what we were looking was rational and reasonable from a ROE point of view,neg,train
So you're going to get -- are you going to get growth there? Or are you primarily going to get funding there? Or do you see both?,neg,train
"You’ve heard me say, if we have 245 and somebody wants to do a $6 billion merger, we probably wouldn't do it",neg,train
"But as we grow our business, organically, we will clearly move over to 250",neg,train
"I don't think it's too confusing, but if you want details, there's a map in the appendix that shows you exactly how these items map over",neg,train
"But essentially, it’s basically just clarifying all commercial as commercial and all retail as retail and I think that will be cleaner for you as we go forward",neg,train
"But as I indicated earlier, we had strong core long growth of 3",neg,train
"We’ve had some very strong individual areas, like, commercial leases were up 27",neg,train
"9%, government finance, up 17% and revolving credit, up 13",neg,train
"Continuing on slide 14, our capital, liquidity and payout ratios remains strong",neg,train
Our dividend payout ratio was 42% and our total payout ratio was 103%,neg,train
"This reflects 373 million in share repurchases, which included 53 million de minimis repurchase",neg,train
"Looking ahead to the full year, we expect to grow loans in the 2% to 4% range, which should be stronger than the 2% from 2017; taxable equivalent revenues up 2% to 4% and expenses flat, excluding merger related and restructuring chargers and other one-time items and an effective tax rate of about 21%",neg,train
"While we continue to -- continue investing and drive improved revenue growth, we feel very confident that our flat expenses will result in positive adjusted operating leverage for full year 2018",neg,train
"Core -- on a reported or GAAP margin basis, we still have the headwind of purchase accounting",neg,train
"So GAAP will be probably relatively flat, maybe up a little bit, more relatively flat for the year, but core continuing to rise if we get a couple of rate increases",neg,test
"And then on auto, we’ve been focused obviously on the optimization to increase the margin so that certainly could hit on volume",neg,train
"We do think that we have an opportunity in the middle on the near prime side, we've been on the super prime and on our traditional business and in our real estate subsidiaries, really lower subprime",neg,train
So we think there's a way to have a full spectrum offering there,neg,train
That was a function really of good core loan growth and non-interest income,neg,train
"4%, which reflected strong insurance, which is somewhat seasonal, typically seasonal and other fee business income",neg,train
"Now, net interest margin did decrease 5 basis points as expected",neg,test
"Our core margin decreased 4 basis points, all again as expected",neg,train
"Recall that our actual, absolute margins are still relatively high, some of the highest in the peer group",neg,train
"And on that point, AML/BSA remediation, have you given sort of an order of magnitude in terms of how much benefit you would get once you get that remediated in terms of how much lower cost you would have from -- once you get that remediated, what’s sort of the run rate benefit you get in terms of compliance and control costs?",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI,neg,train
I want to take a minute now and cover a couple of key strategic issues to me that are more important than all the detailed numbers,neg,train
"So ’17, as I just described was a very strong year",neg,train
However it was a strong year in the midst of some substantial headwinds that I want you to understand,neg,train
"First of all, Main Street where we participate primarily was still slow",neg,train
"Everybody is centering on sort of losses in the 130 billion, 135 billion range, which is the largest cat year we've ever had, but offsetting that is the investment income for the carriers that really offset the losses in 2017 and we're still seeing new alternative capital coming into the market, but still reinsurers are seeing rates up about 4% to 5% and what we think that could mean for us is pricing kind of move in for that negative too that stabilized and in the last half of the year and we get another bite of the apple that renewals at mid-year, which should help",neg,train
"But I think you can see pricing up a percent or two, sort of stabilized in the last half of the year and that would be very, very helpful for the business for sure",neg,train
Please also note that our presentation includes certain non-GAAP disclosures,neg,test
Please refer to Page 2 and the appendix of the presentation for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP,neg,train
Just wondering how much additional capacity there is to add to this book and what’s the strategy from here?,neg,train
And it appears we have time for no other questions,neg,train
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr,neg,test
We’re seeing really good fee growth as you can see across all the categories,neg,train
"We had insurance, service charges, you saw our private equity business, bank card, check card, so we get really good contribution as retail really comes back",neg,test
"Specifically insurance, I think as Kelly mentioned that, could be a lever for us",neg,test
"Just to kind of give you a background today, pricing is still down 2% and 2",neg,train
"5% kind of range, down from sort of the 4% range",neg,train
"And to drive core growth, you get retention, retention is up year over year",neg,test
3% in -- which drove organic growth this year at 1,neg,train
"And then in the other segment, the financial services one would tend to be the larger clients, more national businesses, those commercial products were up the most",neg,train
"So it's very clear the duration, you can see between each of the deposit categories",neg,train
"But as Kelly said, our average beta is 15% and if you factor in the good growth that we’re getting in our commercial deposits and DDA and all that, it’s really down to 8 basis points",neg,train
So we’ve had great control of our deposit costs so far,neg,train
Planned run-off in average mortgage and auto loans drove net interest income decline,neg,train
The decline in mortgage and retail origination reflects the impact of our optimization strategy,neg,train
"Regarding residential mortgage, loan production was 65% purchase and 35% refi, relatively stable",neg,test
"As you can see, we closed 78 branches for a total of 148 branch closures for 2017",neg,train
"Charge-offs were 36 basis points versus 35 in the third quarter and 42 on a like quarter, so a really nice improvement in credit quality",neg,train
"We did complete 371 million in share repurchase and we did do a 53 million all de minimis purchase, which is allowed under CCAR",neg,train
"And then finally, I would point out that the economy we believe is going to be better",neg,test
This tax change will flow through and will have a big impact on the economy,neg,train
"We get constant clear feedback that the market leaders out there, the CEOs have dramatically increased their level of confidence and optimism",neg,train
Thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today,neg,train
"On today's call, we have Kelly King, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review the results for the fourth quarter of ’17 and provide some thoughts for the first quarter and the full year for 2018",neg,train
"We also have Chris Henson, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer who will participate in the Q&A session",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] It appears our first question comes from [indiscernible],neg,train
"Nancy, so it's mostly the organic and what happened in those businesses is, as we were -- as the market was moving along through ’16, ’17, we've been in the business a long time",neg,train
What we saw was the spread just kept getting tighter and tighter and tighter and the returns on equity got to be tighter and tighter and tighter,neg,train
And so that was driving the profitability of the business down,neg,train
And then you may recall Nancy that the CFPB came in with an iron club and made us change the way we priced our product through our -- indirect auto purchasing through auto dealerships and that caused the substantial runoff in that business,neg,train
"A couple of questions, Kelly, on the run-off portfolio, can you just sort of gives us an idea or a rough estimate of how much of that was organically generated versus acquired? And when you look at the organically generated portion of it and you look back and, okay, here's why we're having to run it off, can you just tell us, I guess, what happened",neg,train
"BB&T Corporation (NYSE:BBT) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 18, 2018  8:00 AM ET",neg,train
"And in terms of kind of spending some of the benefits of tax reform, does keeping expenses flat kind of include that as well?",neg,train
"We changed our segments, effective this quarter to align with the reporting management changes with emphasis on faster growth, while continuing to address the needs of our clients",neg,train
You can see the old segments versus new segments on slide A-10,neg,test
"Continuing on slide 15, community bank retail and consumer finance net income was 263 million, down 33 million from last quarter",neg,train
"Now, let me turn it back over to Kelly for closing remarks and Q&A",neg,train
"As you saw last year, we closed about 150 branches, we’ll close another 150 or so this year",neg,train
"If you look at page 7, in terms of our loan growth, I’d call it strong core loan growth",neg,train
"You know over the last year, we've had to explain away the fact that we’ve been making long-term strategic changes in a couple of our key portfolios, auto and mortgage",neg,train
"But the good news is, it is nearing an end",neg,train
"So if you look at that slide, you'll see that our subtotal commercial was up",neg,train
"And let me point out that these numbers you're seeing do represent some changes we made in terms of our loan presentation to better reflect our business, primarily between commercial and retail",neg,test
We're pretty bullish on very high quality real estate opportunities right now,neg,train
"Certainly, it's still a very aggressive marketplace, but we have an emerging more national platform with some very professional bankers",neg,train
"So we're doing larger more institutional lease supported projects, pretty low risk",neg,train
"We continue to see with the economy improving and housing being strong, good, solid single family construction, things like that on the CRE book",neg,train
"So my point here is you feel at this point that the guidelines are -- the checkpoints or whatever are in place that we're not looking at another run off portfolio in 2, 3, 5 years?",neg,train
"And then just back to loan growth, I appreciate some of the color you gave us in terms of the drivers, can you just talk to us -- give us an update around your appetite to grow commercial real estate balances and then separately your appetite to grow auto? Thank you",neg,train
"Actually, you can see it very clearly in our new disclosures and segment",neg,train
"So in the first segment disclosure of the retail, basically, it has flat interest bearing costs for the last year, so there's been basically zero beta in the consumer portfolios",neg,train
"In the community bank commercial, it has the commercial deposit is up, I think they were up I think maybe eight basis points or so",neg,train
"But in terms of outlook, what we would expect next quarter is about a 3",neg,train
"Economic expansion is really good for the insurance business, because anything that helps drive more units, more exposure to existing clients and more units is very helpful to do business production, but really it's still too early to estimate the full impact of the catastrophes",neg,train
"My follow-up question is, there appears to be a bipartisan momentum to change definition of SIFI and in the Senate version, there is certainly an asset threshold that’s attached currently of 250 billion",neg,train
"I thought you were pretty clear about the focus on -- take focus on organic growth this year and I'm wondering if that does -- the SIFI threshold does officially change the 250 billion, does that change your thinking in terms of organic versus inorganic strategy",neg,train
"We did do one-time bonuses for associates, which we were happy about, which was 36 million pretax or 23 million aftertax",neg,test
"We did have a total of -- therefore the net impact of tax reform items of 43 million aftertax, which is $0",neg,train
"Our merger related and restructuring charges was 14 million, which is $0",neg,train
"07, that our earnings per share was diluted because of the tax changes and the restructuring charges that reoccurred during that quarter",neg,train
My first question is on the reinvestment of some of the tax windfall,neg,train
"Kelly, I believe you made some comments at a conference in December about potentially investing some of the tax reinvestments and I just wanted to make sure that that's contemplated in the flat guidance and how should we think about the multi-year strategy for investing that windfall",neg,train
"Turning to slide 9, credit quality exceeded our expectations and continues to look very strong across the board",neg,test
"Net charge-offs totaled 130 million or 36 basis points, up 1 basis point, but down 42 basis points from fourth quarter 2016",neg,train
"When excluding government guaranteed and PCI loans, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing were 5 basis points of loans and leases, flat versus last quarter",neg,train
"Loans, 30 to 89 days past due, increased 65 million or 6",neg,train
"8% from last quarter, mostly due to the improvement in C&I loans and foreclosed properties",neg,train
"At 28 basis points of total assets, the NPA ratio has not been this low since the third quarter 2006",neg,train
"Obviously, your guidance relative to the first quarter to the full year implies a pretty steep ramp and I know you guys talked about how the derisking efforts will basically cease come the midpoint of the year, but what areas of the portfolio are you actively growing? Are there any geographies that you guys are experiencing more growth than others?",neg,train
"If you look at page 5, just kind of a bigger chart, but that’s just ahead of you, if you want to dig into these changes, you can very easily see how the personnel expense and the merger related charges and revaluations and the donations, all figured in just fine, I’m explaining how you got from $0",neg,train
"With loan growth and the GAAP margin that we have, that's going to be in -- close to 2",neg,train
5% to 3% if you get in the middle of the range and fee is about the same,neg,train
"So there's some play in between it, but the way we put the plan together, it's actually pretty balanced between net interest income and non-interest income",neg,train
"So if we got 2 or 3, we could be at the high end of that 2 to 4 kind of revenue outlook?",neg,test
"It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alan Greer of Investor Relations for BB&T Corporation",neg,train
"If you look at page 6, I would just point out we had a really good performance relative to our data",neg,train
"We were particularly pleased with our credit quality, which was 36 basis points, below our range of 40 to 50",neg,train
"Net income, net interest income was down a little bit",neg,train
"We have said stable, so that’s actually in that category",neg,train
We’ve said it will be up slightly and so 5,neg,train
"And again, we did -- I say, we would expect to achieve positive operating leverage and we did",neg,test
"So, we felt good about the guidances that we had given",neg,train
"Well, obviously, we always try to exceed everything we've put out",neg,test
We're still relatively conservative in terms of what we project,neg,train
"But if the economy takes off faster, which I think there's a decent chance of, I mean, the global economy is good, as you saw this morning in China, that 6",neg,train
"9% GDP, Japan has had six consecutive quarters of increasing GDP, Europe is doing fine",neg,test
"The US’s tax code is just being implemented as we speak, regulatory restrain is down lower",neg,train
"There is some really good chance in my mind that the economy will do better, particularly Main Street, and BB&T is right in the middle of Main Street",neg,train
"I think you’ve got a couple of things there, John, that might -- that could do that",neg,train
"Insurance revenues could be higher than we projected, if the market responds with better pricing",neg,train
"Now, the market is not recommend -- or not seeing huge increases",neg,train
We think the insurance price increases will be higher because of all the catastrophes and we compete on loan growth and that could cause more positive operating leverage,neg,test
"And interest rates could be, we think that it’s -- we're forecasting, I guess, as Daryl just want and plan, but we think there would be more like 3",neg,train
"But again, it's what we think is prudent right now",neg,train
"And the second part of the question about how to think about the base, I think you captured it right, which is it's 2017 adjusted for tax and adjusted for the significant items that we spoke about",neg,train
"And I just want to mention one other thing real quick just as we think about 2018 because, again, we haven't thought about these things in a vacuum",neg,train
"One of the things that's -- I mean, which I just feel very good about the operating model that we have is, even if you exclude the tax benefit that we have for next year and when we think about, again, the -- 2018 the way it was laid out, our ability to spend this additional amount of money in technology",neg,train
"And if you work through the math, the effect on -- the effect of tax is something like 4 points or so on the EPS growth rate",neg,train
"I'll let Mike walk you through the detailed financial impact of the tax legislation and our other actions when he takes you through the financials, but I do want to make a few comments, first, regarding the new tax legislation",neg,train
"In addition to the favorable impact this quarter, we expect to see our effective tax rate go from approximately 25% to approximately 21% in 2018",neg,train
We expect to reinvest the vast majority of the tax benefit in to our employees and our businesses in 2018,neg,test
"In addition, we're hopeful that the increased competitiveness of corporations due to the lower effective tax rates and related investments those companies are making will result in a continued strong business environment both in the U",neg,train
"Charlie, you talked a little bit about CCAR and how you guys are planning on still returning a lot and that 100% shouldn't be limitation",neg,train
"But in your prepared remarks, you categorized acquisitions ahead of returning dividends and share -- and buybacks, and I just want to make sure that you -- how you're talking about that",neg,train
Is that in an increment perspective or just in terms of the prioritization of M&A versus incremental buybacks? Just how you're thinking about the push and pull there,neg,train
"Investment management and performance fees increased 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher equity market values, money market fees and performance fees",neg,train
The year-over-year increase also reflects the favorable impact of a weaker U,neg,train
"On a constant-currency basis, investment management and performance fees increased 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016",neg,train
Foreign exchange and other trading revenue increased 3% year-over-year and decreased 4% sequentially,neg,train
FX revenue of $175 million was unchanged year-over-year and up 11% sequentially,neg,train
"Investment and other income decreased $278 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of U",neg,train
tax legislation on our renewable energy investments was offset in the tax line,neg,train
"In mid-December, we were pleased to receive a positive response to our Title I resolution plan submission from the FDIC and the Fed",neg,train
The regulators acknowledged the important steps we have taken to enhance the firm's resolvability and facilitate our orderly resolution in bankruptcy,neg,train
"The agencies found no deficiencies or shortcomings in BNY Mellon's 2017 plan, which validates the enormous efforts we have made to enhance our resolvability",neg,train
"Mike, main question is just the combination of the three largest asset managers",neg,train
"I think you said Mellon Capital, Standish and Boston Company",neg,test
What will be the name of the new combined entity? And what's the structure of the new entity? Anything else you can elaborate on?,neg,test
And if I could ask then a second question on just organic wins and losses,neg,train
And kind of I'll just put it in one question but there's two pieces,neg,train
We also consolidated our 3 largest asset management firms in the U,neg,train
", Mellon Capital Management, Standish Mellon Asset Management and The Boston Company, and announced the launch of a specialist multi-asset investment management firm with $560 billion of assets under management, which combines the best of these companies",neg,train
"Before turning to Q&A, in addition to Charlie's comments, there are a few things to factor in your models for 2018",neg,train
We expect net interest revenue and the NIM to continue to benefit from higher rates and the small securities portfolio repositioning and that the benefit may be offset slightly by lower balances if noninterest-bearing deposits contract as expected,neg,test
The quarterly investment and other income line is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million for 2018,neg,train
"In the first quarter, we expect to be at the higher end of the range due to the gain on the sale of our investment boutique, CenterSquare",neg,train
"Also, in the first quarter, I would like to remind you that staff expense will be impacted by the acceleration of long-term incentive compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees that typically takes place, the impact of which should be similar to last year",neg,train
"And as I mentioned, we expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%",neg,train
That includes the full incremental technology spend and what we expect the growth to be in the rest of our expense base,neg,train
"We still intend to return substantial capital to our shareholders this year, subject to approval through the CCAR process, but we've thought how best to use this additional ongoing benefit from the change in tax law",neg,train
We believe these investments are the right thing to do and good for all,neg,train
This includes increasing minimum wages for all employees to $15 per hour in the U,neg,train
"Before I begin my prepared remarks, I would like to congratulate Todd Gibbons on his new role as CEO of Clearing, Markets and Client Management and thank him for all his hard work and accomplishments as CFO",neg,train
"If there are any additional questions or comments, you may contact Ms",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and webcast",neg,train
"When we were sitting here last quarter, there were some very, very large specific transactions that we did not win that we were all very knowledgeable about and, quite frankly, we're fine not winning, either because of price or because of terms",neg,train
"As we sit and look at the business levels this quarter, it doesn't look like we've lost anything significant",neg,train
"Although we lost a couple of clients recently, the pipeline is strong",neg,train
"While our Depositary Receipts revenue was lower due to volumes and the timing of corporate actions, our offer remains competitive and we're continuing to win our fair share of new issues coming to the market",neg,test
Just a little follow-up on the spending commentary and without running the risk of front running March 8,neg,test
And is there anything in there for what we would just call white space businesses that BK is not in today?,neg,train
Now I know this is high level but we thought it would be helpful to give you some context,neg,train
"As I've said several times, we hope to answer all your questions on March 8, and we'll do the best job we can",neg,test
"But for now, we'd love to answer whatever questions you have, especially about this quarter",neg,train

"I guess, if you could just talk very briefly about your market assumptions for your low to mid-double-digit EPS growth in 2018 just in general, if it's improving -- continued rise in equity markets and the amount of Fed hikes that are factored into, say, the future's curve, and then whether -- on a GAAP basis, so from that $3",neg,train
"72 basis, including the charges that you talked about for 2018, which sounds like about $0",neg,train
"25, whether you'd still have GAAP EPS growth in 2018",neg,train
The third item is how we think about our performance excluding these items and also excluding the significant items in 2017,neg,train
"As an illustration, if you were to use the revenue growth included in your models, which is roughly between 3",neg,train
"5% to 4%, and our expectation that all other non-technology expenses would grow at a very low rate, this would result in EPS growth of low to mid-double digits, which is consistent with our actual performance over the last few years",neg,train
"So when we get to 2019, we certainly wouldn't expect to see anything like this",neg,train
"We would expect to see just however we would normally manage our expenses, which hopefully would be very prudently, but nothing like this",neg,train
"I mean, Brian, as you can imagine, like getting exact numbers on market share -- this is Mike, by the way",neg,train
Getting exact numbers on market share and some of the subcomponents on -- in Corporate Trust is pretty difficult,neg,train
"But when you look at the structured product market like CLOs, we saw a big decline in market share over the last 3, 4, maybe 5 years, probably down 30% or 40% over that time period",neg,train
"Having said that, there are parts of the Corporate Trust business where our market share has been stable or growing over that time period as well",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
"And just to clarify, the additional spend is -- does not include severance that you talked about for 2018, and you framed that well",neg,train
Our final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"We do think that we should look at what's fair and right amongst our employees given the changes that were made and, certainly, what some of the goals of it are",neg,train
"Moving minimum wage to $15, I mean, I'd love to sit here and tell you that we're leading this country to some place where it isn't but that's not the case",neg,train
We're -- we'll do what it feels like the right thing to do,neg,train
And so it feels like sharing that portion with our employees is the right thing to do relative to the tax law change,neg,train
And so I wouldn't expect anything else that we would do from your standpoint to be material,neg,train
tax legislation and the losses related to the sale of certain investment securities reduced fee and other revenue by 11% year-over-year,neg,train
"The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher equity market values; net new business, including growth in collateral management; and the favorable impact of a weaker U",neg,train
"The sequential increase was primarily driven by net new business, securities lending, equity market values and money market fees",neg,train
"Now on Slide 8, Investment Management achieved record assets under management of $1",neg,train
"9 trillion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher equity market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U",neg,train
"We experienced total long-term active inflows of $17 billion, driven by $23 billion of flows into our liability-driven investment strategies due to high demand from clients and $2 billion of inflows into multi-asset and alternative investments",neg,train
These inflows were offset by outflows of $6 billion from active equities and $2 billion from fixed income strategies,neg,train
"I want to say almost all of it, if not all of it, is for the existing businesses that we have here as opposed to businesses that we're not in",neg,train
But I would think about it in several different categories,neg,train
"We said before, think about it as the GAAP number adjusted for the fourth quarter impact of tax and the other significant items that we disclosed",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW,neg,train
"With that, Charlie wants to make a few more comments about 2018",neg,train
"We didn't necessarily invest in all the places we should have, and that's what resulted in the decrease in share",neg,train
"Average loan balances declined 15% year-over-year, driven by higher interest rates and increased 2% sequentially",neg,train
"Average deposits declined 4% year-over-year, mainly the result of actively managing our deposits lower to meet regulatory ratio requirements, and increased 3% sequentially",neg,train
"Lastly, average tri-party repo balances grew 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, mainly the result of organic growth from existing clients and the onboarding of new clients",neg,train
"72 of GAAP EPS in 2017, it sounds like there'll be another $0",neg,train
25 of charges based on how you outlined the charges for 2018,neg,train
"So would we still have -- on a GAAP basis, do we still have positive EPS growth in 2018? Just to tie that with the adjusted EPS growth",neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $1",neg,train
There were 2 significant items recorded in the quarter that impacted the results,neg,train
41 per common share gain related to the new U,neg,train
"And second, we also recorded a $246 million after-tax or $0",neg,train
"24 per share negative impact related to severance, litigation and asset impairment and the sale of certain securities in our investment portfolio, the majority of which will better position us for the future, as Charlie noted",neg,train
"Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE:BK) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 18, 2017  8:00 AM ET",neg,train
"As you've seen, we've had consistent revenue growth but aspire to increase the rate of growth over time while maintaining a consistent risk profile",neg,train
"I do want to remind you there are no silver bullets here when it comes to revenue growth, meaning any improvement in increasing the growth rate will take place over multiple years",neg,train
"And I do want to reiterate an important comment I made last quarter, we like the businesses that we're in",neg,train
"So on the first point, just a point of clarification",neg,train
"We're not assuming is using your estimates for revenue growth, when you look at the analyst estimates for revenue growth",neg,train
"But I would say just, if you were to characterize it, it's a continuing relatively strong business environment for the places where we operate, not worse, not substantially better from today, but looking very much like where we are",neg,train
"You're talking about the tax, the benefit of the tax, using that",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch,neg,train
Investment Services achieved record assets under custody and/or administration of $33,neg,train
"3 trillion this quarter, up 11% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting higher market values",neg,train
We estimate total new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were $575 billion in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Consistent with last quarter, total revenues in our Corporate Trust business were up mid-single digits",neg,train
"Lastly, in treasury services, the fees are just part of the story",neg,train
"We're seeing steady, consistent growth in total revenues in the business, which includes both fees and net interest revenue, up low double digits this quarter",neg,train
"All in all, while it takes some work to parse through the quarter, we feel good about our underlying business results and remain very focused on driving longer-term franchise growth",neg,train
And then maybe -- Mike and Todd are here and may want to chime in a little bit,neg,train
"I think -- listen, I think it's a little bit of both",neg,train
"Other times, they insert you into a market that you're not necessarily in",neg,train
"Mike, my question was, of that $297 million, how much is asset impairment just so we can think about more correctly looking forward?",neg,train
Let me now move on to talk about Investment Services,neg,train
"Asset servicing results were helped by the strong markets and new business, particularly in collateral management",neg,train
"As I've interacted with our clients, I continue to believe we have more opportunity to partner with our clients across the many services we offer",neg,train
We had strong estimated new business wins this quarter of $575 billion in assets under custody administration,neg,train
We ended the year with record assets under management of $1,neg,train
"Our full year adjusted pretax operating margin continue to improve, adjusting for the significant items",neg,train
"On this tech spend that you all talked about, somewhere in the $200 million to $250 million extra in 2018, is that the amount that will be the annual amortization of the tech spend so that will continue at that rate? Or is it just all being expensed in '18 and we are done with that? Can you give a little more clarity on how to think about it? Because your software and equipment line jumped up quite a bit this quarter, and Mike, is that the new run rate?",neg,train
And so you'll be spending an extra $250 million this year in terms of reinvesting the tax benefits,neg,train
""" We have a high degree of flexibility with a significant portion, certainly, of our technology spend",neg,test
I personally would like to do as much as we possibly can,neg,train
"If we didn't want to do it, we wouldn't be doing it, meaning we're not just sitting here saying, ""Okay, there's this big tax benefit coming through so let's go figure out how we can go spend it",neg,train
""" In some respects, they're related; in some respects, they're totally independent, right, which is we've been -- you all know we've been going through this review thinking very much about what we think we need to do for the future, and we came to the determination that we think we can intelligently spend this amount of money",neg,train
"But as I said, there are -- it's not one big spend",neg,train
How should we think of the $250 million extra technology investment relative to that $2 billion base? Because it might not be apples to apples in that comparison,neg,train
"I think the linked -- the primary driver of the linked-quarter decline, as you probably know, is the seasonality that we see in the third quarter",neg,test
"I think the volumes that we saw in sort of the core issuance, cancellation, cross-border settlement area was a little bit lower than we expected, and that really drove the further decline",neg,train
"Listen, that's a great question, and I probably wasn't as clear as I could have or should have been",neg,train
I would say we have a very strong analytical framework for how we think about how and where we're investing,neg,train
And when -- so when I talked about -- I forgot a word I used,neg,train
"Good morning, and welcome to the BNY Mellon Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
"With us today are Charlie Scharf, our CEO; Mike Santomassimo, our CFO; and members of our executive leadership team",neg,train
Our fourth quarter earnings materials include a financial highlights presentation that will be referred to in the discussion of our results and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website,neg,train
The estimated repatriation tax on foreign earnings amounted to $723 million,neg,train
"The impact on our renewable energy investments was de minimis to net income as the pretax accounting resulted in a reduction of $279 million recorded in investment and other income, which was offset by the tax benefit from remeasurement of associated tax-deferred liabilities",neg,train
"The new tax legislation also reduced our regulatory capital by $551 million, driven by the repatriation tax offset by the tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities",neg,train
"When you're thinking about these tech investments, what sort of back is acceptable? How far out are you willing to look?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC,neg,test
This included a $320 million negative impact from the U,neg,train
"tax legislation and other charges, which decreased total revenue by 8%",neg,train
"In addition, each of our segments saw growth in revenue with investment management and performance fees increasing 13% and investment services fees up 5%",neg,test
"This included a $282 million pretax impact for severance, litigation and other charges, which increased expense by 11%",neg,train
"As Charlie mentioned, we are hopeful that the new legislation will help stimulate economic activity, which had proved to be beneficial to us and our clients over time",neg,train
Our effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be approximately 21%,neg,train
We do not expect the BEAT or the Base Erosion Anti-abuse Tax to have an impact in 2018,neg,train
"The impact beyond 2018 is uncertain, but based on what we know today, we expect it to be immaterial",neg,test
We expect to repatriate a limited amount of cash from our non-U,neg,train
entities due to the capital and liquidity requirements of those entities,neg,train
"And lastly, our capital distributions in the first half of 2018 will not be impacted",neg,train
The remainder of the year's buybacks will be subject to the CCAR process,neg,train
"I think it's actually pretty exciting, some of the opportunities we're seeing",neg,train
So I think it'll help the growth and not necessarily change the pricing,neg,train
We should -- we're already seeing some benefits of improved volumes there,neg,train
I think the challenge is we got to pick the right ones,neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank,neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI,neg,train
"Lastly, turning to our capital and liquidity ratios on Slide 12",neg,train
Our capital ratios were modestly lower due to the impact of the new tax legislation,neg,train
"9%, which meets the 2018 regulatory requirement of 5% with a reasonable buffer",neg,train
"But it'll be a little bit higher -- as we go into Q1, it should be -- it'll be a little bit higher than what we saw in Q3",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies,neg,test
The year-over-year increase primary reflects higher money market fees and growth in long-term mutual fund assets,neg,train
Both periods also reflect the impact of termination fees due to lost business recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017,neg,train
"Issuer services fees decreased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower volumes, fewer corporate actions, lower fees due to reduction in shares outstanding in certain Depositary Receipt programs, primarily offset by higher Corporate Trust revenue",neg,train
The 32% sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonality in Depositary Receipts revenue,neg,train
"Treasury services fees decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher compensating balance credits provided to clients that reduce fee revenue and increase net interest revenue partially offset by higher payment volumes",neg,test
And that excludes the reinvestment or just the additional charges?,neg,train
"Thomas Gibbons - Vice Chairman & CEO of Clearing, Markets and Client Management",neg,train
"So I'm not sure if I'm answering your question, so tell me if I'm not",neg,train
Just a quick one here on comments initially on the tax benefit,neg,train
I believe you said that your intention is to spend the 2018 benefit on investments and sharing with employees,neg,train
"Is that the right way to think about this? Or am I reading too much into your comments, Charlie?",neg,train
"Additionally, we had $1 billion in outflows from index products",neg,train
We experienced cash outflows of $4 billion in the quarter,neg,train
"If you recall, we had cash inflows in the first three quarters",neg,train
"money market funds, the largest segment of our cash business, have grown 22% for the full year 2017",neg,test
Our wealth management business continued its positive trend with fees up 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially,neg,train
"Higher net new business, continued loan growth, which was 7% higher year-over-year, helped to drive performance this quarter",neg,train
The significant items in the quarter impacted the margin by just over 300 basis points,neg,test
"Revenue should outgrow expenses, and that'll be good for margins",neg,train
"The tagalong question was, of the things that you're investing in, do you believe some of them will get explicit pricing as opposed to the bundled relationship that you have with these complex clients?",neg,train
"So you make an investment upfront, and then it generates revenues in future years",neg,train
"I'm just trying to understand, do you expect to get a positive earn-back over a certain number of years on these?",neg,train
"Before Charlie and Mike discuss our results, let me take a moment to remind you that our remarks today may include forward-looking statements",neg,train
Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,neg,train
"These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement in the earnings press release, the financial highlights presentation and in our documents filed with the SEC available on our website",neg,train
"Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, January 18, 2018",neg,train
"During the quarter, the macro environment continued to improve, and as expected, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 25 basis points, which slightly improved our fourth quarter net interest revenue",neg,test
"Additionally, the strong global equity market performance helped to drive a record quarter for AUC/A and AUM",neg,test
"Also, as you are aware, the tax legislation was passed in late December",neg,train
The bill is complex and will take some time to fully implement,neg,train
The amounts reflected in the earnings release represent our best estimates of the impact from the legislation to date,neg,train
I think we've seen a lot of operating leverage and operating efficiency improvement over time,neg,test
"It's a business where clients just take, take, take, and thank you very much",neg,train
"Within these investments, are there things that you think in the future you'll be able to price explicitly for?",neg,train
"First, regarding additional charges, as we finish our review of the businesses, we would expect to have additional charges during 2018",neg,train
"These can include severance, real estate, the impact of programs to bring more automation to our activities and other items",neg,train
I just want to do -- get some clarification around your positive operating leverage comments for 2018,neg,test
So are you saying that expenses may be going up by 5% and you're still expecting positive operating leverage?,neg,test
Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs,neg,train
"On the low to mid-double-digit EPS growth, is -- you're talking about the base for that being the $3",neg,train
72 GAAP full year 2017 EPS? Or is it something else? I'm just getting a bit confused on all the discussions about charges and what's in and what's out,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research,neg,train
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon",neg,train
Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material,neg,train
You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent,neg,train
"Aside from the tax impact and these significant items, our underlying business performance in 2017 reflected continued consistent and steady improvement, and most importantly, our client franchises continue to grow",neg,train
This includes 12% in investment management fees and strong performance fees for the quarter,neg,train
"We were clearly beneficiaries from the strong equity markets, but we also saw some benefit from flows this quarter with net positive flows of $12 billion, including strong performance from our LDI strategy",neg,train
"On a full year basis, flows were up $64 billion compared to last year's outflows of $23 billion, marking a significant turnaround for this business",neg,train
"The software and equipment line jumped up as a result of the charges we took, with an asset impairment there",neg,train
So don't think of the fourth quarter number as the new run rate for that line,neg,train
"Mike, in terms of the name, we'll make that decision toward the end of the year after the consolidation is completed",neg,train
"In terms of what we're doing, I mean, we're clearly consolidating the trading activities, the back office and -- all the various back-office activities",neg,train
"So that's operational, technology, support functions in compliance and HR and finance",neg,train
Mellon Cap is distinguished through a lot of its passive activities,neg,train
The thing we are probably under-invested in has been in the multi-asset where clients are going,neg,train
This gives us a much easier platform to develop more multi-asset and solution type products,neg,train
So the end game would be that we would keep the best of breed in equity fixed income and passive and develop the multi-asset capabilities along with that,neg,test
"We know we're a bank and are proud of it, but we're different from other banks",neg,train
We will discuss the impact of the new tax legislation,neg,train
2 billion tax benefit to net income associated with the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at a lower statutory corporate tax rate of 21%,neg,train
The net deferred tax liabilities were primarily associated with goodwill and intangible assets,neg,train
"Issuer services, that line was down $90 million this quarter, linked quarter, a little bit more than is expected",neg,train
"Even the uptick in Q3 was less than -- are you continuing to lose share? Any more color on that business? What's your plan for that business, Charlie, as you're looking at all of this?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan,neg,train
"So let me just make sure -- I've tried to cover this in my remarks a little bit, which is we've given a tremendous amount back through dividends and buybacks",neg,train
"And so as we think about what the future looks like, that hasn't changed",neg,train
"And so relative to the core incremental capital generation here, we would assume that through dividends and buybacks, you would continue to see the same types of trends that you've seen in the past, subject to CCAR",neg,train
So that hopefully does mean increasing dividends and whatever the difference is in terms of buybacks,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
"We had 3 very significant wins in the quarter, some of the big players",neg,train
So we do feel some -- now it's particularly in asset servicing,neg,train
"So we see some pretty good momentum there and some continued pipeline, but I think it was a little bit episodic",neg,train
"And your second question was around the termination fees in the clearing business, and that did have a positive impact",neg,train
"Over the last 10 years, we only have -- of our 10 largest customers, only 2 of them are with us 10 years ago",neg,train
"So there's constant change in here, as you would expect, with consolidations and other things",neg,train
"And during the quarter, we also won some very nice business in the clearing business, so I'm still feeling pretty good about it",neg,train
Do you think this will sort of ignite additional spending at your peers so that you will sort of be in line? Or do you see yourself actually improving your capabilities versus peers and potentially grabbing market share over time?,neg,train
"And if pushed, there's probably more that we could do there as well, but that's something that we really need to think through",neg,train
"So as I said earlier, I think this business, run properly, creates operating leverage",neg,train
"It's important for you all, but it's important for us to be able to remain relevant in terms of how we price and how we deliver our products and services",neg,train
"So as we look through 2018, it's very much like you're sitting in the cockpit of an airplane and we're ready to pull different levers",neg,train
"Listen, I have no way of knowing what peers will do and what they're currently doing other than what we all read about",neg,train
"And the -- meaning, we're not just -- I mean the word trust bank, it's like the word boutique",neg,test
It's just they're kind of funny words given the size and the scope and the breadth of what we do,neg,train
"We do some things that some of our competitors do, and we do it well and they do it well",neg,train
But we also have some things that are very unique to what we are and to the kind of conversation that we can have when we sit across the table from clients,neg,train
And so one of the things which is high in our list to talk through in detail on March 8 is exactly how we think we're differentiated versus the other people that you often think of as our competitors,neg,train
How should we think about the impact of the renewable energy credits going forward now that tax reform is completed?,neg,train
"Listen, I mean, there's no easy answer to the question",neg,train
It depends on the type of investment that we're making,neg,train
"Honestly, we don't spend a lot of time talking about the payback in those terms",neg,train
"When it comes to product development spend, there are 2",neg,train
Maybe we'll think a little bit about whether we could put a little bit more clarity around that when we get to March 8 for you,neg,train
I'm excluding the significant charges that we had in 2017 and whatever we could have in 2018 when I say that,neg,train
"If you have any questions, please feel free to call Investor Relations",neg,train
"And the only thing that I would add, Mike, is just a couple of things, which is, first of all, on brand",neg,train
"And so what we've said is let's try and be really smart, do some real work to try and figure out what makes the most sense for the long term for the brand as opposed to just pick something which feels good in the moment",neg,train
"And my own comment just on this, because Mitchell was obviously well underway with this before I got here, is it just -- I mean this makes all the sense in the world",neg,train
"So we do have a year of consolidation work to do, which is never easy in these businesses",neg,train
"But for the long term, just -- to me, it makes all the sense in the world",neg,train
"It makes a ton of sense to reinvest in technology, so I applaud what you're doing on that",neg,train
I'm wondering if you're thinking about keeping the dividend payout ratio in line with what your earnings trajectory is likely to be,neg,train
So just on that for a second -- and Todd's sitting here,neg,train
"Todd has been very, very direct about what we've done and not done in Corporate Trust in our conversations over the past bunch of years",neg,train
And I think we have a -- Corporate Trust is an important and a strong part of our business,neg,train
We went through a process here several years ago where we thought about whether it belonged here or not,neg,train
"We -- after going through a process and thinking it through, the conclusion was made that it does belong here, it's an important part of the future, and we suffered from that",neg,train
"And even internally -- again, this is -- Todd, I'm echoing what you've said, is, we moved very, very quickly to reestablish ourselves in the business and we lost salespeople",neg,train
"And so given that, what's your thinking on the business just given that you're losing share? Is that just price competition still continuing? Or maybe, Charlie, from your perspective, as you're relooking at all of this, what's your thinking at the moment?",neg,train
So we'll try and spend more time on this on March 8 when we have more time together,neg,train
"But certainly, we do hope that post 2018, we would be able to start seeing some kind of benefits, whether it's on the revenue side or the expense side, because of the amount of money that we're investing",neg,train
"But at this point, hard to put a number on it",neg,train
Now I would like to turn the call over to Charlie,neg,train
"Just another follow-up around the spending and kind of, Charlie, to your commentary around low to mid-single-digit EPS growth",neg,train
"And then part two, I guess, with EPS growth commentary, this is more clarification, should we be thinking about 2017 really kind of as the core number ex all the charges, as the base to layer on sort of the low to mid-single digit -- sorry, low to mid -- double-digit EPS growth?",neg,test
"With that, let me run through the details of our fourth quarter results",neg,train
All comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I note otherwise,neg,train
"Consistent with previous quarters, the impact from foreign currency translation had an essentially neutral impact on net income on a total company basis",neg,train
Some of the charges in our significant items this quarter are a result of that work but we expect there will be more in 2018,neg,train
"We are at the tail end of our review, and we'll provide an update at our March 8 Investor Day",neg,train
"Listen, I think, one of the things that we -- one of the benefits I think that we have when it comes to technology is we're not dedicated in any one specific part of the country or part of the world",neg,train
"We have technology resources in Pittsburgh, in New York, in India, in different parts of Europe",neg,train
And I think the -- I had to say this,neg,train
"It's -- I don't feel like the war on talent in technology is something, at this point, which is holding us back",neg,train
"When you look at our turnover, not excessively high in any way, shape or form, so I feel okay about where we are there",neg,test
"5 billion, which were up 2% and noninterest expenses of $11 billion, up 4%",neg,test
The significant items in the quarter decreased revenue by 2% and increased expenses by 3% full year and earning -- and increased earnings per share by 5%,neg,train
"In addition, in the fourth quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend payments and $3",neg,train
"Now obviously, it will be less than it otherwise would have been because it's a meaningful number",neg,train
"But when we think about the dynamics of our business and what we're shooting for, that's not something that we're just putting on hold and saying we'll revisit that in 2019",neg,train
That is very much still part of our core thinking,neg,train
"And quite frankly, as we see the revenue environment pan out through 2018, we still have levers to pull",neg,train
So that's something which is still very much part of the psyche of the way we think about the company,neg,train
And I know you've asked something else beyond that but,neg,train
"Listen, I think, on the first, I think if you went around and asked people in this room, you might get nuanced answers",neg,train
"And there is -- and it's obviously just extraordinarily important relative to its outcomes for how we run the business and what we do with capital, which is, obviously, a hugely important responsibility you have as a management team",neg,train
"So I think as we think about what could get done, I think there has just been very positive commentary about taking -- keeping the good pieces of CCAR and continuing to focus on how it can be made into a better tool both for regulators, for the beneficiaries, ultimately who's -- our customers and their customers and for us as well",neg,train
"Turning to Slide 11, you will see that noninterest expense increased 14% year-over-year and 13% sequentially",neg,train
"This includes $282 million pretax for severance, litigation and other charges, which increased total expense by 11%",neg,train
Let me highlight a few of the year-over-year changes in the table,neg,train
The sequential increase in staff expense was primarily related to higher severance expense,neg,train
"The year-over-year change was also impacted by higher incentive compensation expenses, driven by stronger underlying performance",neg,train
"The increase in software and equipment and professional, legal and other purchase service expenses was primarily the result of an asset impairment in the quarter",neg,train
I guess the $250 million would be more of the investment spend,neg,train
Maybe just to circle back on the expense growth just to make sure I understand this,neg,train
"So just looking at sort of the tax benefit, I guess it would imply, when you do the math here, a little over $250 million of additional reinvestment spend",neg,train
"And if we think about how that -- so I guess, first of all, is that around what you're thinking? And then would that imply more like mid-single-digit expense growth from your core 2017 base? Or are the efficiency gains that you've achieved through your 4Q '17 actions of reducing the layers of management, improving the asset management with the consolidation and other things, creating more like a low single-digit type of core expense growth in 2018 like you've been sort of -- you've been running at?",neg,train
"As we look forward to 2018, we think about our performance in 3 distinct pieces, first, any additional charges resulting from the review underway that I've spoken about; second, the impact of tax reform and the effect of investments we will make in our employees and businesses a result of the tax reform; and third, the core underlying franchise performance excluding these 2 items",neg,train
"While we aren't giving forecast or guidance, I thought it would be helpful to put some specificity around our thoughts for 2018 by talking about these items individually",neg,train
"Second, regarding the impact of tax reform, we are anticipating that the impact of the lower tax rate would be almost entirely offset by the actions we will take to reinvest this benefit in our employees and our businesses",neg,train
I believe we've been prudent in how we've thought about our excess capital generation,neg,train
We think we have done this and have returned in excess of $9,neg,train
8 billion to our shareholders over the last 3 years,neg,train
"Let me cover a few items before turning it over to Mike, and then we will open it up for questions",neg,train
"As you can see, the quarter was impacted by two significant events, first, the new U",neg,train
"41 per share this quarter; and second, a series of actions we took reduced earnings by $0",neg,train
"If you look beyond those items, our underlying results benefited from the strong equity markets, and we continued to show modest underlying growth in revenues and reasonable profit growth across the firm",neg,train
"And on the first part of your question, again, we would -- the $250 million, that is -- assume that's P&L and assume that's, at this point, a way to think of ongoing P&L as well",neg,train
"Brian, the way I would look at that is -- what Charlie explained is it's not $3",neg,train
72 because that includes both the tax benefit as well as the significant charges that we called out,neg,train
"So if you take that combination, that's, I believe, about $0",neg,train
That's what you have to start with for those numbers to play themselves out,neg,train
"I mean, meaning year-over-year, we might have had some technology increase anyway",neg,train
"But the way we think about it is, again, you can think -- the minimum wage increase is not a big number in the context of this",neg,train
Your calculation on going from 25% to 21% is a little less than $250 million or so,neg,train
"And so that's a good way to think about it in terms of range, the way we're thinking about the increase in technology spend",neg,train
"And away from that, we would assume that there is very, very little other expense growth as of now",neg,train
Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS,neg,train
"This includes the 2 significant actions we took since we last spoke, the senior management leadership changes and the changes in our U",neg,test
The leadership changes and organizational realignment are going very well,neg,train
"We've reduced layers, aligned more closely around our clients, created more business representation on our executive committee",neg,train
I'm confident that these actions will enable us to serve our clients more effectively and holistically but this is a work in progress,neg,train
"Obviously, as you know, we need to work through the whole CCAR process to sort of get that all approved and worked through",neg,train
I think the only thing I would say is there's no need to sort of stay within sort of 100% payout as we look forward that we're aware of,neg,train
And so I think we're sort of thinking through that now as we go through the CCAR process,neg,train
"You will see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis, net interest revenue of 100 -- of $862 million was up 2% from the year-ago period and up 1% from the third quarter",neg,train
"This quarter included $15 million negative impact of lease-related adjustments, including $4 million related to the new tax legislation",neg,train
As a reminder the fourth quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by $25 million of interest hedging activities and a $15 million premium amortization adjustment,neg,train
The impact of these items in both quarters negatively impacted the growth in NIR by 7% or the NIR would have been up 9% if you adjusted for those items discussed,neg,train
We experienced moderate noninterest-bearing deposit runoff in line with our expectations following the rate increase,neg,train
And then you said you want to increase the market share in the Corporate Trust business,neg,train
Can you just give us a sense of how you're viewing or what -- how you look at where the market share is today? Where was it previously? And where do you think it can go to?,neg,train
"And while it's still pretty small in the scheme of the overall revenue base, we are seeing examples in some of the products, like collateral management, where we have been investing in more sort of innovative adjacent products to help clients optimize their collateral across the globe, and we have been able to expressly charge for that product",neg,train
"So right now, we will still get the benefit of those renewable credits",neg,train
"So if you think through our tax rate, we effectively expect to be at the statutory rate of 21%",neg,train
"But remember, we're paying still the state and local taxes as well, so it would have been higher if it wasn't for the benefit of things like the renewables",neg,train
"So there was a little bit of restructuring in the value of those, which run through the asset investment and other income, and so the negative drag on investment and other income is going to be slightly less than it otherwise would have been",neg,train
"But the net benefit is still there's still credits, and we still are going to get the benefit of those credits",neg,train

Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"And so as we look at what was won in the asset servicing business, these are things that people are working on here for a long time, hopefully get implemented within 2018 and we can do the work on the things that go beyond that",neg,train
We have -- we've won and lost from some of the consolidation that's taken place in the industry over the past bunch of years,neg,train
"But we feel very good about what, I would say, as we get towards the end of 2018, 2019 looks like based upon other wins that we've had and how long it takes to implement some of these things",neg,train
"And not trying to front run your big day here in March, just was curious about that, whether or not that distinction was an important one, which sounds like it was",neg,train
"And then my follow-up, can you expand on the kind of competition for talent that you're seeing, which is compelling you to share the benefit with employees? And when you use that term sharing the benefit with employees, maybe can you expand on that a little bit? Are we talking about increases in bonus and incentive comp? Are we talking about base salary increases, which prove more durable? Just if you could frame that a little bit, that would be really helpful",neg,test
Slide 11 shows core net interest income and core net interest margin at the bank,neg,test
These measures exclude the impact of interest recovered on previous nonaccrual loans,neg,train
Core net interest income increased 1% linked quarter while increasing 10% year-over-year to $57,neg,train
06% flat from the previous quarter and up 17 basis points year-over-year,neg,train
"And if I could sneak one last one, just have you seen any impacts yet from the changes in the tax while relating to jumbo loans that we seen in early pay down activity to get below the threshold or any other impacts in that book of business?",neg,test
"As a result of this agreement which was announced December 20, we moved Anchor's assets and liabilities to held-for-sale as of December 31, 2017 and we recorded a $1",neg,train
"3 million loss on sale of affiliate which is included in the other income line of revenue, a $24",neg,test
"9 million goodwill impairment charge and $400,000 of legal expense",neg,test
Results attributed to Anchor's performance during the fourth quarter and in prior periods remain consolidated in the income statement,neg,train
"However, Anchor's AUM is excluded from AUM and net flows",neg,train
We’re doing a good job in portions of our commercial lending business,neg,test
I think the key metric for us is deposit build,neg,train
We want to go up-tempo on growth without diminishing liquidity,neg,test
On Slide 5 we show a detailed breakout of our consolidated expenses,neg,train
Fourth quarter total operating expenses excluding notable items decreased 1% linked quarter to $68,neg,train
"Operating expenses increased year-over-year due to strategic hires, performance-based compensation, technology initiatives and occupancy expense",neg,train
Slide 12 contains financial information for the wealth management and trust segment which operates under the Boston Private Wealth brand,neg,test
9 million due to the higher levels of average assets under management,neg,train
Operating expenses were flat linked quarter and are down 13% year-over-year excluding last year's goodwill impairment charge,neg,train
Slide 14 shows AUM net flows for all of our business segments,neg,train
Reported results from the investment management segment have been restated to exclude Anchor Capital flows during the past five quarters,neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, the investment management segment showed net flows of $20 million and the wealth advisory segment had net flows of $29 million",neg,train
"On a consolidated basis, total company net flows were $128 million",neg,test
"Third, we announced a reorganization of our BPFH executive team to structure our company around clients and client development rather than business lines",neg,train
More integrated delivery of private banking and wealth management services provided a significant lift to all of our Boston Private businesses in 2017,neg,train
So that’s how we’re thinking about the core NIM going into first quarter of 2018,neg,train
"While we disclosed both GAAP and operating results in our press release and the earnings presentation, our comments today will primarily focus on the company's operating results which exclude the impact of these one-time non-cash charges",neg,train
"And then with the FTE adjustment, you obviously get the benefit on the tax line",neg,train
"Is my math right, is about 5 to 6 basis point just drag on the NIM just optically begin in the Q1 is that right?",neg,train
"Yes, 22% - it might be a little lower in the second quarter Chris depending on stock comp vestings",neg,test
So there could be some volatility but I think 22 is the right number for the full year,neg,train
I mean see I think long-term it will kind of grow in line with the other categories,neg,train
"I refer you also to the forward-looking statements qualifier contained in our earnings release, which identified a number of factors that could cause material differences between actual and anticipated results or other expectations expressed",neg,train
Additional factors that could cause Boston Private's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the company’s filings submitted to the SEC,neg,train
The net interest margin increase was driven by increased loan yields partially offset by increased deposit costs,neg,train
The banks cost of interest-bearing deposit increased four basis points linked quarter from 48 to 52 basis points while the all-in cost of funds including DDA increased three basis points from 45 to 48,neg,train
"Steve maybe question for you or Clay, you talk about the high end of 8% to 10% I think in the past you said loan growth, the securities portfolio a little bit smaller kind of flat on a sequential basis",neg,train
Is that going to grow proportionally with loans or is there a bit of a remix story that would suggest and the asset growth might be couple of hundred basis points behind loan growth this year?,neg,test
"So I think the key numbers to watch are AUM development, revenue build, and how that translates into continued margin progress",neg,train
"Yes, that’s the right way to think about it and as it relates to NIM, we just talk about core NIM for a second, we’re expecting maybe 1 to 2 basis points accretion in the first quarter given the rate hike in December and 30% of the balance sheet that reprices within 30 days kind of getting that lift",neg,train
We have an ambitious plan for 2018 and I'm not going to kind of change the parameters we’ve given you previously,neg,train
We want that to be a 20% business and then we'll go from there,neg,train
"This is Adam Bromley, Director of Investor Relations of Boston Private Financial Holdings",neg,train
We welcome you to the conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings,neg,train
So I think it’s a good in a world where there are very few win wins I actually think this is a good transaction for Anchor,neg,train
Well on a GAAP basis the share count was lower because of anti-dilution,neg,train
"Kind of two part question, first our targets remain intact and we're just going to adjust",neg,train
"We are going to tax adjust the targets but our - both our goals, as well as our short-term incentives and our long-term incentive plan are very ROE attached and my Board is not going to give us a lot of additional points for tax break which I'm completely aligned with",neg,train
"So we’re just going to adjust our targets for the tax effect in effect, so that’s the first part",neg,train
Slide 10 shows the past five quarters of average loan balances and deposit balances by type,neg,train
Total average loans during the quarter increased 7% year-over-year to $6,neg,train
Residential mortgage continues to show the strongest growth coming in at 13% year-over-year and plus 3% linked quarter,neg,train
The year-over-year growth rates of the individual loan categories on the slide were affected by reclassifications we made as of 12/31/16,neg,train
This call contains forward-looking statements regarding strategic objectives and expectations for future results of operations and financial prospects,neg,train
They are based upon the current belief and expectation of Boston Private's management and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties,neg,train
Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements,neg,train
There is still some expense relief to be had in the coming year based on actions that we took throughout the year where you didn’t have the full year impact,neg,train
So you could see - we don’t need to grow expenses I guess to - what I am trying to say we don’t need to grow expenses to keep revenue growth building in that business,neg,test
On Slide 9 we show the private banking segment excluding the wealth management and trust portion of our bank,neg,train
Total revenue at the bank decreased 1% linked quarter and increased 6% year-over-year driven by 11% growth in net interest income,neg,train
"6 million, flat linked quarter and an increase of 23% year-over-year driven primarily by revenue related compensation and strategic hires across our markets, increased technology investment and occupancy expense",neg,train
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Boston Private or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements,neg,train
"This quarter we booked a $900,000 provision credit due to net recoveries and improvements in loss factors partially offset by an increase in special mentioned loans and loan growth",neg,train
The chart below highlights the bank's asset quality for the quarter,neg,train
"And then Steve on the margin, I think you said the effective tax rate is 22% is that right effective?",neg,train
"Second part, tougher to call longer term I think no question near term I think our capture, our translation of tax benefit into earnings is going to be highly efficient",neg,train
"What happens in the fullness of time I think it’s a little unclear for the entire industry, so we’ll see how that plays out",neg,train
But I think in the foreseeable future the translation of a tax reset into earnings is going to be pretty direct,neg,train
And the next question comes from Michael Young with SunTrust,neg,test

"And I would like to turn the conference over to Adam Bromley, Director of Investor Relations",neg,train
"So core NIM up a couple and then optically the hedge with the tax adjustment, okay",neg,train
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018,neg,test
"In addition to the charge we took this quarter, we have also previously announced that we will be recognizing a tax expense of approximately 10 million to 12 million at the time of closing",neg,train
"At the close of the transaction, we estimate our Tier 1 common capital will increase by approximately 33 million",neg,train
"Second, we believe the recently enacted federal tax legislation will greatly benefit shareholders in the form of a lower effective tax rate in future periods",neg,train
And the next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW,neg,train
"How it affects borrower behavior? How it affects tax exempt business where we’re active longer-term, we’ve even had shareholders ask how is it going to affect client mobility",neg,train
Most of our clients are domicile in high state and local tax domains,neg,train
So far I think our crystal ball always little hazardous but I think our crystal ball suggest that the tax reset is overwhelming positive,neg,train
I think the client behavioral affects to extent they emerge will be gradual and relatively slow moving with the exception of tax exempt financing,neg,train
I mean there is a pretty immediate mathematical affect on the calculus between taxable and tax exempt,neg,train
"So just switching to capital management pro forma for the sale of Anchor, you guys will be in a decent capital position I mean above your targets",neg,test
"With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Steve",neg,train
On Slide 15 we show our investment management segment including contributions from Anchor Capital,neg,train
"Total revenue increased 9% linked quarter driven by $900,000 of performance fees realized in the fourth quarter",neg,train
The 1% year-over-year decline was driven by a decline in performance fees which were $1,neg,train
And the next question comes from Alex Twerdahl with Sandler O'Neill,neg,train
"7 million, a 1% linked quarter increase and a 6% increase year-over-year",neg,train
Total core fees and income increased 3% linked quarter and 4% year-over-year,neg,train
"Linked quarter revenue growth in our market linked businesses was driven by performance fees in the investment management segment, while year-over-year revenue growth was driven by 7% growth in our wealth management and trust, and wealth advisory segments",neg,train
Private banking fees decreased linked quarter due to lower loan fees while increasing year-over-year due to higher BOLI income,neg,train
"During the fourth quarter, our company recorded a GAAP net loss of $18",neg,test
"Excluding the notable items, our operating results adjust to $20",neg,train
"For the full-year, our company generated GAAP net income of $40",neg,train
6 million which adjusts to operating net income of $79,neg,train
"Casey we have a couple of options, a lot of things [are disposable] [ph] we could do",neg,train
We're confident though at the end of the day that we’ll be able to do something with the capital where we make this transaction accretive to earnings based on the capital build we’re going to generate,neg,train
My last comment has to do with BPFH Board composition,neg,train
"Last night we announced via an 8K filing that John Morton, a long time board member has decided to depart from our Board at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting in April",neg,train
John joined our Board during the depths of the financial crisis and he has been an invaluable Board member and advisor,neg,train
All of us appreciate his service and I will personally miss his wise counsel and support,neg,train
"Our call this morning includes references to an earnings presentation, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website bostonprivate",neg,train
"Joining me this morning are Clay Deutsch, Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Gaven, Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
We’re not a huge tax exempt player but we have facilitated tax exempt borrowings for our business cliental,neg,train
Obviously that business pretty immediately recalculates under the new tax regime but it’s something we’re going to watch very closely,neg,train
"Again my stands on it that every time we toggle through this, we come up believing that the net effective of the reset as the industry puts all the DTA reval behind, it the ongoing earnings effect at least for us we believe are pretty substantial positive",neg,train
"(NASDAQ:BPFH) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 18, 2018  8:00 AM ET",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] All right, if there is nothing more at the present time, I would like to return the call to Clay Deutsch for any closing comments",neg,train
One of the features of our new leadership structure is that Steve Gavin has become our Chief Financial Officer,neg,train
Steve previously served as Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance and more recently as the Chief Financial Officer of Boston Private Wealth,neg,train
Steve is joining me on the call today and will be walking us through our fourth quarter and full-year results,neg,train
Steve is familiar to most of our analysts and shareholders and I'm proud to have him here with me today on the call,neg,train
"Second, Boston Private Wealth continues to demonstrate improvement showing positive net flows every quarter throughout 2017 with EBITDA margins in the high single digits during the second half of the year",neg,train
"Good morning, and welcome to the Boston Private Financial Holdings Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
I’d call it more cost discipline rather than cost cutting,neg,train
"We like the economic structure that's now built into the business and now we're very, very focused on continued client acquisition and development and building the business from here on",neg,train
"As you saw in our press release, fourth quarter and full-year financial results include the impact of one-time non-cash charges resulting from two notable items, one, our agreement to divest Anchor Capital Advisors and two, Federal Tax Legislation",neg,train
And then also for loans and deposits I think historically your guidance has been somewhere in the neighborhood of 8% to 10% but obviously if you are paying lower taxes you’re able to accrete capital at a faster clip,neg,train
Does that guidance need to go higher in order to actually put that capital to work?,neg,train
"Clay, wanted to start off with just kind of big picture, you’ve always guided to 11% ROE and now we’re obviously in a lower tax rate environment",neg,train
Do you anticipate kind of changing that bogie and what are your thoughts about competing a way that tax benefit over time as it relates to the ROE target?,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
Well we continue to like - the affiliates have had appealing ROE enhancement characteristics for us throughout and that math continues to work,neg,train
So we like the ROE enhancement of our non-Boston Private Bank businesses and that’s unchanged I mean the math changes slightly after tax but that math still works,neg,train
"With that, I will now turn it over to Clay Deutsch",neg,train
I just thank you all for your interest in us,neg,train
And we think that formula is going to do good things for us,neg,train
"My comments will begin on Slide 3, with a discussion of the notable items impacting this quarter's results followed by an overview of the quarter and the full year",neg,train
The first notable item is related to our previously announced agreement to divest our equity interest in Anchor Capital Advisors,neg,train
I think you look back to last quarter share count that’s the pretty good approximation of kind of how share count develop,neg,train

Slide 6 shows the consolidated income statement for the quarter,neg,train
"Operating pretax pre-provision income was $29 million, an increase of 5% linked quarter and a decrease of 4% year-over-year",neg,train
6 million represents a 4% linked quarter increase and a 6% year-over-year decrease,neg,train
"If these reclassifications were applied to prior periods, CRE growth would have been approximately 4% and C&I growth would have been approximately 2%",neg,train
Average total deposits during the quarter increased 7% year-over-year to $6,neg,train
4 billion with money market accounts showing the most significant growth year-over-year,neg,train
I would absolutely love to see us perform at the higher end of the range,neg,train
"Highlights for 2017 from my vantage point include revenue generation at the bank which efficiently translated strong loan and deposit growth and a rising rate environment into core net interest margin expansion for the full year of 13 basis points, which allowed us to realize 12% growth in net interest income",neg,test
So you use the average fully diluted from Q3 and kind of this quarter?,neg,train
We project that our company and shareholders will benefit as our effective tax rate on continuing operations will decrease to 22% in future periods from approximately 30% in 2017,neg,train
The results shown on the following slides present our results on an operating basis,neg,train
A full reconciliation of GAAP to operating results can be found in the appendix,neg,train
"Alex the way I would think about, our goal right now is we are going to manage to 4% to 5% expense inflation on a core basis or take Anchor out of it",neg,train
"The only thing I would remind you as it relates to expenses, we typically have the uptick in comp and benefits in the first quarter due to reset of payroll taxes",neg,train
So that’s typically anywhere from 2 million to 3 million so I’ll just be mindful of that,neg,train
With Anchor I just came to the view that our company has not been a great owner of autonomous asset management firms,neg,train
I just wanted to drill on a little bit on a couple of things,neg,test
"One, if you guys could update your expense guidance for 2018 both in the wake of the new tax plan also adjusting for Anchor Capital would be great?",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies,neg,train
"I think Clay in your prepared remarks you said that part of the rationale for selling Anchor is the simplification of the business model which we have certainly seen over the last 10 years, a lot of that how much more of this ""simplification"" perhaps in a way of divesting others subs should we think about in 2018 or in the future?",neg,train
"And then maybe a final one on the share count, it came down a bit this quarter is that options related I’m trying to get a sense of is this good share count to use for 2018?",neg,train
"Moving to Slide 16,our wealth advisors reported total revenues of $13",neg,train
Operating expenses decreased 11% linked quarter while increasing 18% year-over-year,neg,train
The 18% increase is driven primarily by expansion of the partner body in both of the firms in this segment,neg,train
Operating expenses net of the goodwill impairment and transaction-related legal expenses increased 3% linked quarter due to higher compensation expense and declined 4% year-over-year,neg,train
The investment management segment fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA margin excluding goodwill impairment was 35% exceeding our corporate target of 30%,neg,train
Well we're ending this year more than half way there,neg,train
"So while I gave you the fourth quarter average return, that line has just been steadily rising throughout the year",neg,train
And we’re now getting operating leverage through favorable growth dynamics coupled with lot of expense in infrastructure discipline,neg,train
Fourth quarter 2017 segment EBITDA margin of 41% exceeds our corporate target of 30%,neg,train
The 41% EBITDA margin includes a revaluation of a long-term incentive plan in one of the firms,neg,test
"Criticized loans finished the quarter at $155 million, special mentioned loan have increased $50 million year-over-year coming off a historic low level for the consolidated bank at year-end 2016",neg,test
The increase in special mentioned loans was driven by two relationships where we believe the risk of loss is low,neg,train
We continue to maintain strong reserves with ALLL to loans finishing the quarter at 115 basis points down from 117 basis points in the previous quarter,neg,train
"Excluding the impact of notable items, our company generated a 10",neg,train
2% return on common equity during the fourth quarter and 10,neg,train
"The second notable item is related to a revaluation of the company's deferred tax asset, deferred tax liability, and low-income housing tax credits following the federal tax legislation that was signed into law during December",neg,train
"As a result of the revaluation, the company incurred $12",neg,train
9 million of income tax expense during the fourth quarter,neg,train
So it’s only mid-January and hope spring internal but we’re feeling pretty good about what we intend to do this year,neg,train
So I’ll look forward to updating all of you as the year unfolds,neg,train
"I mean I guess so in terms - so it has to be revenues from here, there is no more cost cutting from here on now?",neg,train
"Excluding previously discussed notable items, the company's pretax pre-provision earnings increased 2% driven by 12% growth in net interest income partially offset by 8% growth in operating expenses",neg,train
So wanted to start on the wealth management and trust,neg,train
"You guys have been talking about improving the pretax margins, I think you guys have a long-term goal of 20% in mind",neg,train
It certainly a perceptive question and something to watch - I think to watch closely is the kind of second order behavioral effects of the tax reset,neg,train
The first order effects are very straight math you can all do the math on 30 resetting to 22,neg,train
On Slide 13 we show both new business flows and net flows at Boston Private Wealth for the past five quarters,neg,train
New business flows in the fourth quarter were $213 million which is above the five quarter average of $181 million,neg,train
"I will now turn it back to Clay to discuss our Wealth Management and Trust, Investment Management and Wealth Advisory Segments",neg,train
LIFO and metal price lag was unfavorable again this quarter and increased cost $42 million due to rising alumina prices and the increased value of the inventory held at smelters,neg,train
"Rising alumina prices also impacted our other corporate expenses line item, which increased $48 million sequentially due to higher intercompany profit eliminations primarily between our Alumina and Aluminum segments",neg,train
Our fourth quarter results represent our highest adjusted EBITDA since our launch just over a year ago,neg,train
"We generated $775 million in adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, up $214 million sequentially primarily on higher alumina prices",neg,train
"While this is up nearly 40% from the prior quarter, 4 short-term operational and financial impacts contributed to results that were about $50 million lower than our stated expectations",neg,train
"For items below the EBITDA line, depreciation, depletion and amortization declined $7 million sequentially primarily due to currency movements",neg,train
Other income and expense at $10 million improved $6 million sequentially primarily due to improvements in equity income,neg,train
Our operational tax rate depends heavily on the jurisdictions where we have profits and losses,neg,train
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $90 million sequentially to $152 million due to higher earnings in our AWAC joint venture,neg,train
Let's take a deeper look at the factors driving adjusted EBITDA,neg,train
"Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA is up $214 million with higher pricing and other improvements more than offsetting unfavorable energy and raw material costs",neg,test
"First, higher metal and alumina market prices and unfavorable currency added $320 million",neg,test
"Second, energy and raw materials headwinds, unfavorable energy performance decreased earnings $100 million driven, as Roy had said, by drought conditions in Brazil and increased Spanish power market prices",neg,train
The $15 million of raw materials inflation was due to higher prices for carbon materials and smelting and for caustic and refining,neg,train
"In the quarter, the net loss attributable to Alcoa Corporation was $196 million or $1",neg,train
06 per share primarily due to restructuring costs associated with the resolution of the Rockdale Energy contract and the announced closure of their Rockdale operations,neg,test
"Beginning in January of 2021, Alcoa will contribute 3% of eligible compensation to the retirement savings plans for these affected employees in addition to the existing savings match that Alcoa already offers",neg,train
"Also in 2021, the company will end its contribution toward pre-Medicare retiree medical insurance in the U",neg,train
I would like to turn the conference back over to Roy Harvey for any closing remarks,neg,train
"First question, seems like caustic prices have starting to soften recently",neg,train
So just want to understand the caustic price or maybe the price change underlying your assumptions so that we can kind of flex the guidance as we want,neg,train
"Or another way to ask that question is, of the $400 million higher costs, how much of that is from caustic?",neg,train
"Out of that $400 million of higher cost, it's pretty evenly broken down between higher caustic",neg,train
"So roughly 50% of that is higher caustic, and the other 50% is carbon products on the smelting side",neg,train
"And so for assumption's sake, I think you can use $200 million and $200 million for each of those",neg,train
So the capital framework that we discussed in the call today is for 2018,neg,train
So it looks like the lion's share of the curtailments are coming from this NDRC curtailed capacity,neg,train
"I just wanted to see if you could walk us through maybe -- you mentioned the permits, the licensing",neg,train
Maybe if you could just kind of walk us through the procedure for acquiring operating rights and how that might look,neg,train
Just trying to get a sense of how sticky that is there,neg,train
"And lastly, $68 million of discrete tax items are primarily deferred tax asset revaluations in foreign countries as well as a $22 million charge related to the U",neg,train
"Alcoa significantly grew profits in the fourth quarter, most notably in our Alumina segment as we continue to benefit from favorable commodity prices",neg,train
We reported an adjusted net loss of $196 million or $1,neg,train
06 per share largely due to the decisions aligned with our strategic priorities,neg,train
Net productivity and other improvements more than offset weaker price mix primarily in the Alumina segment,neg,train
As far as the -- let's turn to the business segment performance,neg,train
"Given our strong cash generation, we're planning discretionary contributions into the plans in 2018",neg,train
These contributions will position us for annuity purchases that will transfer the most of the risk and cost possible without increasing our minimum required contributions,neg,train
You've talked about this quite a bit on the dividends versus buyback angle,neg,train
It seems like you're not going to give too many more hints away on that,neg,train
"But just in terms of the spending throughout 2018, I think you said you'd pay the $300 million liability in 1Q",neg,train
What's the CapEx profile throughout the year in terms of the sustaining business and the value creation $150 million? Is it more two half-weighted? Or how do we think about that?,neg,train
"It's also zero-sum with one exception, which is that there's a few smelters that are coming online just now that have permits that were already granted",neg,train
So it's just a bit of a legacy issue that's coming to bear now,neg,train
"For 2017, our total return-seeking capital expenditures was $118 million",neg,train
"Over 2/3 of that spend, roughly $80 million, were for major projects that were substantially completed in 2017",neg,train
"This EBITDA outlook is based on an LME price of $2,200 and API price of $390 with $400 million of raw material cost increases included as the key headwind",neg,train
"Our shipments outlook for 2018 is in line with 2017 actual results, except for slightly lower aluminum shipments primarily due to the ABI curtailment",neg,train
"Each year, the first quarter tends to be our lowest shipment quarter due to fewer days in the quarter and scheduled maintenance creating a $40 million sequential headwind",neg,train
"As seen in 2017, we expect our second half of 2018 to be stronger than the first half",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"So we haven't decided whether it's a dividend, a special dividend or a share buyback at this point",neg,train
"Roy mentioned that we're taking some actions on the net liability side, so let me highlight a couple of those",neg,train
plan asset portfolio and investment strategy to more closely align with our peer group,neg,train
"When our investment strategy was defined prior to the company's separation, we had a complex and defensive portfolio, which hasn't provided the returns expected",neg,train
"By the first quarter of 2018, we will have unwound that strategy and also change the number of asset managers",neg,test
"So in terms of the production guidance for the year, the ABI, you're saying, is not included",neg,train
"It's basically considered the 1 potline and that's it, and that's how you've done your production forecast? I just want to make sure that was clear",neg,train
And then just on the discretionary payment into the pension,neg,train
"Does that capital payment count against the capital return basket that you were provided for when you renegotiated your revolver, which I think gave you $350 million this year, plus I think you had a carryover benefit from last year, so you had, I think, roughly $525 million of total capital return this year so",neg,test
"We've made certain adjustments related to the Becancour facility within both our financial and operational outlooks, and Bill will discuss this further",neg,train
"In Canada, we also recently decided to lock out the union membership of ABI smelter in Becancour, Québec after the union rejected our proposed labor contract",neg,train
Management employees are now operating 1 of the 3 potlines at the location,neg,train
We made it clear to the union that our best and final offer would have provided competitive wages and benefits while taking into account market dynamics and the need to strengthen Becancour for the future,neg,train
Now we are focused on providing support to the management employees as they safely operate the plant at reduced capacity,neg,train
Now let's look at our adjusted EBITDA and the full income statement after special items,neg,train
"Additionally, the world, ex China, experienced a more significant price recovery during the fourth quarter than did China",neg,train
"As a result of these factors, Chinese smelting margins have been under significant pressure",neg,train
"In fact, we estimate that more than half of Chinese smelting production was unprofitable in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"And as Roy mentioned, in December, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BB with a positive outlook",neg,train
"Days working capital has steadily improved during the course of 2017, now at 11 days in the fourth quarter compared to 17 days in the third quarter and 14 days at the end of 2016",neg,train
"Return-seeking capital spending was $35 million, and sustaining capital spending was $115 million",neg,train
And then if you could provide a little bit more color on your guidance,neg,train
"So clearly, if we just implicitly look at fourth quarter EBITDA and annualize it, your guidance is below that and the biggest buckets are alumina prices coming down, it seems like, and then some puts and takes",neg,train
"But am I missing any big items? And can you help us understand in the guidance why flat volumes? Is it Becancour coming off, anything else coming on? Is there Wenatchee assumption in there?",neg,train
"As you saw in our earnings release, we announced today an important decision regarding our pension plans in the United States and Canada",neg,test
"First, decisions that directly affect our employees, especially those who have been with Alcoa the longest, are difficult",neg,train
"The pension and other postretirement benefits are by far our largest liability, making change necessary",neg,train
and Canada will no longer accrue retirement benefits under the defined benefit pension plans,neg,train
"The approximately 800 employees affected will instead receive benefits for retirement through defined contribution plans, which are already used by our other salaried employees",neg,train
LIFO and metal price lag was an unfavorable $65 million in 2017 and will vary in 2018 with prices and inventory levels,neg,train
"Other corporate expenses are decreasing $10 million to approximately $150 million as we expect lower intercompany profit and eliminations, but this will still vary depending on metal and alumina prices",neg,train
Our actions this quarter and this year helped prepare us for whatever the market brings in the coming months and years,neg,train
"In China, we are forecasting a lower surplus than we saw in 2017 driven by still robust demand growth in 2018 and relatively lower-than-expected supply growth due to the policy-driven curtailments we expect to impact the start and end of this year",neg,train
Supply growth is also expected to remain disciplined as China enforces its capacity and permitting framework,neg,train
"In fact, the Chinese government reaffirmed its commitment to enforcing this framework earlier today in a policy announcement and set a deadline for the end of 2018 for smelter operating permits to be exchanged",neg,train
So the timing is the middle part of this year,neg,train
"We've not made a decision on whether we would restart Wenatchee at this point, and we'll be running through the numbers and discussions with Chelan PUD in the first quarter of this year",neg,train
"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call",neg,train
"I would now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President of Investor Relations",neg,test
And the transformation guidance appears to exclude any cost associated with Wenatchee settlements,neg,test
So I just want to understand what's the time line to make a decision,neg,train
"And it seems the decision would, one way or the other, impact cash generation this year",neg,train
Just want to get a sense of kind of the timing and the magnitude that we should look at,neg,train
Our next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets,neg,train
"From a cash perspective, we reduced our days working capital to 11 days and generated $455 million in cash from operations, increasing our year-end cash position to just over $1",neg,train
"As we grew our cash balance, we also took decisive actions to address legacy smelting issues in the U",neg,train
"And due to our stronger position, we successfully renegotiated our revolving credit agreement and gained greater flexibility to execute our capital allocation strategy",neg,train
It has been an exciting quarter and first full year for us,neg,train
4% primarily due to higher earnings in our Alumina segment,neg,train
"Year-over-year, our margin improved over 11 percentage points on higher alumina and aluminum prices",neg,test
"In the fourth quarter, SG&A and R&D expenses totaled 2",neg,train

"Yes, I also had a question on the guidance, too, Bill, because you also had a $55 million LIFO hit this quarter and then you talked about a $50 million impact from the drought and some of the operational issues",neg,train
So that would put your run rate and EBITDA closer to $3,neg,train
"And then your LME assumption's, I think, 100 a tonne above what it was this quarter, that would give you another $200 million",neg,train
"But it seems like on a like-for-like basis, you'd be closer to maybe $3",neg,train
"6 billion run rate? So is it -- like, do you feel like you're being conservative in the guidance? Is that math somewhat incorrect? And can you talk about what your assumptions are for FX and what the impact of that was on the guide?",neg,train
"Finally, as previously announced, the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website",neg,train
Our next question is from Novid Rassouli from Cowen and Company,neg,train
"And so you will see some growth this year, which is the result of prior actions and prior permits being granted",neg,train
Any new added capacity would then need to go through that same set of requirements that the curtailed capacity has,neg,train
"So they either need to acquire it from somebody else, or they need to find some way to close their own smelting capacity in their portfolio",neg,train
"It ties back to the Chinese government's declaration that aluminum is oversupplied, and therefore, the more that China enforces its policies, the more traction we have to see them start to reduce that surplus and, at some point, get into a balanced condition",neg,test
"Sequentially, revenues are up 7%, increasing $210 million to $3",neg,train
2 billion on higher shipments in our Alumina segment and higher alumina and aluminum prices,neg,train
"Compared to last year, revenues are up 25% on higher prices for alumina and aluminum and higher shipments across all 3 segments",neg,train
You have two routes in order to find a permit for that as per the rules that have been established,neg,train
The first route is to go out into the market and actually acquire a permit from somebody else,neg,train
So that would mean the closure of another Chinese plant that would be willing to sell those rights,neg,train
"Now as you can imagine, you're seeing those rights, those operating rights, increase in price pretty significantly",neg,train
So the other method that you have would be to curtail your own production,neg,train
"And essentially, what the Chinese government has done is they've established a ratio for aluminum specifically that says in order to gain a permit, you need to close 1",neg,train
So that ensures that you're not bringing new tonnes online that doesn't have a corresponding curtailment inside your own portfolio or purchasing it on the market and having a curtailment in somebody else's portfolio,neg,train
So if you have new -- so that's the example of capacity that's come off-line as a result of these curtailments or closures over the course of 2017,neg,train
"If you have a new smelter that you want to bring online, some of the -- there will be some new production that was permitted back in 2015, 2016",neg,test
"As Roy mentioned, we also made the hard decisions regarding liability management",neg,train
and Canadian salary plans and eliminating the retiree medical sub-fees will reduce our liability by $35 million in the first quarter of 2018,neg,train
"Also, this combination of policy and economics has brought more stability to the Chinese market",neg,test
"At the start of 2017, economics dictated that some smelters would be forced to curtail to preserve cash as the projected Chinese surplus increased",neg,train
"As the year progressed, China's new focus on supply management determined how and where these curtailments should occur",neg,train
This contributed to a more stable and orderly aluminum market in China,neg,train
Special items in the quarter totaled an unfavorable $391 million pretax with the largest amount resulting from the Rockdale contract termination and closure decision,neg,train
"Out of the $391 million, $297 million is restructuring comprised of the Rockdale contract termination, Rockdale plant closure, and take-or-pay energy contracts that curtailed smelters, less a reversal of a reserve for an Italian power matter",neg,train
$39 million of special items and COGS associated with the restart of the Warrick smelter that Roy mentioned previously,neg,train
"Combined restart cost for Warrick have been slightly higher than we had previously estimated, but execution of the project remains on track for completion in the second quarter of 2018",neg,train
Now let's look at a few key indicators of aluminum market cost and profitability,neg,train
Smelters in China faced increasing economic pressure toward the end of 2017,neg,train
"Costs have risen in China more than outside of China driven by steeper increases in prices of alumina, energy and carbon",neg,train
"As I look back over 2017, we had a very strong first full year",neg,train
A favorable market environment helped to significantly increase both revenue and earnings compared to 2016,neg,train
"Strong markets, combined with a disciplined focus on our strategic priorities, enabled us to strengthen and position our company for the future faster than we had anticipated",neg,train
The lower Brazil hydro earnings and higher energy cost in Spain as well as the higher raw material cost for alumina and carbon were partially offset by higher metal prices and productivity improvements,neg,train
Let's take a look at our nonsegment adjusted EBITDA results,neg,train
"Combined, our 3 nonsegment adjusted EBITDA line items changed $69 million sequentially and totaled $127 million",neg,train
Our transformation entities plus our legacy pension and OPEB costs improved $21 million in the quarter partially due to the termination of the Rockdale power contract,neg,train
"And so particularly over this last period where we had less winter curtailments than were expected, we've continued to see those inventories creep up",neg,train
So the good news on the inventory story in China is that we're still relatively light when you think about what is necessary in order to support such a large and intricate smelting -- large and intricate aluminum industry inside of China,neg,train
"In doing so, we'll add building blocks upon our solid foundation to drive returns for our stockholders and ultimately create the Alcoa of the future",neg,train
"I would like to emphasize that we do not make these decisions lightly, and we have considered the real impact on our employees",neg,train
"While the exact impact of this deadline remains open, China is signaling that it is serious about supply reform in the aluminum industry",neg,test
"In sum, the alumina market ended 2017 in balance and is projected to be in a deficit in 2018",neg,train
Now let me spend a few minutes describing the supply side policy activities in China,neg,train
"As we discussed last quarter, a key market driver in both the aluminum and alumina markets has been policy-led curtailments in China",neg,train
"Outside of the segments, our full year outlook is improving on several fronts",neg,train
"Transformation and legacy pension, OPEB expense is improving by $53 million to approximately $50 million",neg,train
Resolving the Rockdale contract is the primary reason for that change,neg,train
If we look at cash generation as of the end of the year,neg,train
36 billion primarily due to free cash flow of $305 million in the quarter and $819 million year-to-date,neg,train
36 billion cash balance is after making the $238 million payment for the Rockdale contract settlement in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Because Alcoa Corporation commenced operations as a stand-alone public company on November 1, 2016, the financial statements are a combination of financials carved out from Alcoa Inc",neg,train
"prior to November 1, 2016, and actual results of Alcoa Corporation thereafter",neg,train
"Accordingly, the fourth quarter 2016 results are part carve-out and part actual results, while the 2017 quarterly results are entirely actuals",neg,train
My second quickly and following up on a previous question,neg,train
"I'm joined today by Roy Harvey, Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer; and William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",neg,train
We will take your questions after comments by Roy and Bill,neg,test
"As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats",neg,train
Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings,neg,train
Leverage improvement continues with net debt of $54 million and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of nearly 0,neg,train
"5 billion, and I'll address that in the next slide",neg,train
"Roy and Bill, I have a couple of clarifications if it's okay",neg,train
First one is on the $400 million projected cost increase,neg,train
Can you just clarify what's the baseline for that? Is that versus FY 2017 or is that versus 4Q levels?,neg,train
"And finally, net income of noncontrolling interest will be 40% of our AWAC joint venture earnings primarily the Bauxite and Alumina segments, which have a 30% to 35% operational tax rate",neg,train
"That's a great question, Chris, but it's not one that I'm necessarily going to answer",neg,train
"To be quite honest, we have a very active procurement group",neg,train
"We are very focused on what we see happening in the market, and our strategy is determined from how we read that",neg,train
"And so we make adjustments as we go along, and to be quite honest, we wouldn't necessarily telegraph that to the market or to our suppliers",neg,train
I would bring up one very -- a couple very specific points for caustic,neg,test
Frustrating thing on caustic is that it takes 5 to 6 months for it to flow through our P&L,neg,train
So we're just seeing the increases that really started about 6 months ago or more coming to our financials right now,neg,test
"The positive thing on caustic is that because of our bauxite, because we have a lower reactive silica, it means that our impact in caustic while frankly it's a large impact, what we see is that some of our competitors have an even larger impact because they have a higher caustic usage per tonne",neg,train
So caustic raw material price increases are never particularly welcome,neg,train
"With that, I'd love to hear some questions out there for either Bill or I",neg,test
5 million tonnes of aluminum capacity curtail as a result of NDRC program targeting unlicensed smelters,neg,train
"To restart, this capacity requires transfer of existing permits, which are limited in number",neg,train
"And as we learn today, this transfer must be completed by the end of this year",neg,train
"In the 2017 to 2018 winter heating season, we have seen curtailments of 3",neg,train
"The enforced curtailments were less than those implied by previous Chinese government announcements for two reasons, First, provincial governments recently provided more specific guidance on the curtailments since our last earnings presentation, which slightly reduced the levels of impacted capacity",neg,train
"And second, there has been a mixed record on provincial enforcement of the policy, especially where NDRC and MEP curtailment policies overlap",neg,train
"With $300 million of discretionary funding, we would expect to annuitize over 9,000 retirees",neg,train
We have further defined our capital allocation model on the next slide,neg,train
"As we've mentioned previously, we're a commodity sector company operating in markets that see significant price volatility, so we take a conservative approach to capital allocation",neg,train
"First, we target a healthy cash reserve, which we have set at roughly $1 billion",neg,train
Becancour is included in those numbers so you have to back out something for Becancour,neg,train
"Now given the fact that we're in the midst of the situation at Becancour, we're not providing guidance on the specific financial impact of the lockout, but you can see what the tonnes impact is, and that should give you an idea of how much that negatively impacts us",neg,train
"As we mentioned earlier, we still anticipate China to be in aluminum surplus in 2018",neg,train
"I guess, some of the big impacts from what you're looking at is, in the fourth quarter, as we discussed, the alumina prices were a little bit higher",neg,train
"The one-time impacts that Roy alluded to, I would say won't recur",neg,train
"So if we were to look at the fourth quarter, I'd say we made $775 million, we'll take you up to around $825 million on a run-rate basis",neg,train
"Then you get the $400 million of higher incremental raw material costs, roughly $100 million of higher currency costs during the course of the year, and that gets you -- should get you back down to the $2",neg,train
"And so I think the main answer to your question, Timna, is that economics are going to the help prove how those supply/demand economics pull through",neg,train
So what we have seen in China is that the market reacts pretty quickly to the changes in the -- in pricing scenarios,neg,train
"And so right now we continue to see a market where you see a balanced supply and demand in alumina, and you've seen the impact on smelters and downstream",neg,train
So I think our view of the market says that both economics and then also the policy side of China is going to keep us more or less in a balanced condition even with those new -- even with the new and restarted portions of capacity coming back online,neg,train
"Nonetheless, it appears that the broader program of MEP winter heating season curtailments across not only the aluminum industry but also the steel, cement, coal and other industries is having its desired impact of improving air quality in the targeted areas",neg,train
So we're going to make the $300 million discretionary contribution this year,neg,train
"When we look at our capital allocation framework, the key variable that we're looking at is our weighted average cost of capital",neg,test
So the $300 million would go towards the $750 million,neg,train
So it would mean an additional $450 million to $700 million in overall debt reduction over the next few years,neg,train
"Thank you very much, operator, and I'd like to thank Jim and Bill as well",neg,train
It was our first full year as a standalone company,neg,train
"We've made a significant amount of progress on our strategic priorities, and we're in a stronger position today than when we launched just over a year ago",neg,train
And our first question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"If you look at how we spent in '17, it's not dissimilar to how it will be spent in '18",neg,train
"So to be clear, we're anticipating $450 million of CapEx",neg,train
"$300 million of that is sustaining, $150 million of that is return-seeking",neg,train
The $300 million that we make in the discretionary contribution to the pension plan won't necessarily all be made in the first quarter,neg,train
So I don't want you to come away with thinking that we make that contribution in the first quarter,neg,train
We will look during the course of the year and see when the best time is to make that contribution,neg,train
"But I would anticipate it to be, in the first half, maybe spilling over a little bit into the third quarter",neg,train
"Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 17, 2018  5:00 PM ET",neg,train
Our next question comes from Curt Woodworth with Crédit Suisse,neg,train
"In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation",neg,train
Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA,neg,train
"Our Alumina segment's adjusted EBITDA, up 177%, drove improved total segment earnings",neg,test
"4Q '17 adjusted EBITDA in our segments totaled $902 million, up $283 million sequentially",neg,train
Let's take a closer look at the sequential comparison for each segment,neg,train
Bauxite adjusted EBITDA declined $7 million primarily due to the operational issues mentioned by Roy at the Juruti mine,neg,train
The Juruti mine issues also had an unfavorable impact of $4 million on our Alumina business,neg,train
Alumina adjusted EBITDA increased $359 million primarily due to higher index prices,neg,train
"Productivity improvements, increased volumes and favorable currency partially offset unfavorable price mix and raw material impact",neg,train
"With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill to discuss our financial results",neg,train
"Yes, Novid, and realistically when you step back and look at it, inventories are following the supply-demand balances pretty close",neg,train
"And so the beginning of 2017, we're already starting to see some relief from those large inventories built up during the great financial crisis",neg,train
And what we're seeing over -- at the end of 2017 is those inventories have continued to come down,neg,train
"So that's a very welcome story, and that looks at all inventories, whether it's on warrant or off warrant",neg,train
"In China, again running a structural surplus, what we have seen are that inventories are growing",neg,train
Just to keep along the same lines of some of the questions earlier,neg,train
"I just want to clarify, Bill, you just mentioned some numbers, but I apologize, it's still not adding up to me",neg,train
"So $775 million 4Q, add $50 million back, $825 million, which annualizes, obviously, $3",neg,train
"And then you gave a $500 million of negative, which is $2",neg,train
"8 billion, so that's a high end of the range",neg,train
"What else is it like -- how much for Becancour, for example, for that 200,000 tonnes? What's the financial impact in the EBITDA for that assumption?",neg,train
"For alumina, we estimate that we ended 2017 in a balanced market",neg,train
"For environmental reasons, we have seen China curtail some refining capacity for the winter heating season between November 15 and March 15, and we anticipate that they will do so again next winter",neg,train
We have also incorporated the impact from the disruption at the Becancour smelter in our world ex China alumina balance figures,neg,train
"In aluminum, we finished last year with strong demand growth above 5%, and we continue to see strong demand growth in 2018 in the range of 4",neg,train
"Outside of China, we are expecting even higher primary aluminum demand growth in 2018 relative to 2017 driven by macroeconomic and end use market improvements",neg,train
"I'll begin with an overview of the markets and our fundamentals-based outlook for bauxite, alumina and aluminum as we enter 2018",neg,test
2018 will likely seek Chinese stockpiles grow as Chinese refineries continue to have an appetite for imported bauxite and supported by increased Indonesian exports and continued production growth in Guinea,neg,train
"Everything we've accomplished this year, our restarts and closures, the headquarters move to Pittsburgh, our pre-projects and production records, our new revolving credit agreement and our cash generation and strong profitability, our employees achieved through our strategic priorities",neg,train
"And following the first year of strong financial results, we anticipate more growth this year",neg,train
"In terms of the two potlines that are off at the moment, will you be able to restart those pretty quickly once the workforce allows it back in? Or how do you keep those in the meantime?",neg,test
"Recall that we remeasure our plans once each year at year-end, so we are seeing the full effect of the annual remeasurement in this quarter",neg,train
The main driver of the year-over-year increase was the 44 basis point drop in pension discount rates causing a $400 million liability increase,neg,test
"In addition, asset returns of 4% were lower than our expected return of approximately 7",neg,test
"Yes, when we say not included -- we have included running 1 potline at ABI",neg,train
"And so if you see the '17 to '18, there's actually a dip in shipments in aluminum",neg,train
That is due to the fact that we've taken out a couple hundred thousand tonnes of capacity at ABI,neg,train
Our fourth quarter adjusted net income at $195 million is 44% higher than the third quarter,neg,train
"Compared to the prior year, our adjusted net income improved $169 million",neg,train
"Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items reached $775 million in the third quarter, up $214 million sequentially as the entire sequential revenue increase of $210 million flowed through to the adjusted EBITDA",neg,train
Adjusted EBITDA is up $440 million versus the prior year,neg,train
The $300 million does not account for that capital return,neg,train
"And just to be clear on that, so the thinking is that we make a $300 million discretionary payment to the pensions",neg,train
And the next logical question that I'm sure people ask is how we do this return to shareholders,neg,train
"And when we get to the point of doing those, we'll announce how we're going to do it",neg,train
"35 billion, an amount more than twice what we earned in 2016",neg,test
Our cash from operations and free cash flow were also very strong in 2017,neg,train
"Let me give a shot at it, and Bill can chime in as well",neg,train
"So essentially what happens -- this is a policy that was originally put into place in 2015, and it was really during 2017 that we started to see real on-the-ground enforcement, and that included real environmental and operational reviews to see what plants were running and whether they were actually permitted",neg,train
So the real game changer in 2017 was that they took action,neg,test
"And instead of allowing excuses, they actually -- we actually saw all unpermitted capacity come off-line",neg,train
"Now going forward, let's say, let's take 2 different situations",neg,train
Let's say that you have capacity that you've already built but that does not have an operational permit,neg,train
"Below the EBITDA line, nonoperating pension OPEB is estimated to be roughly $160 million",neg,train
This change is a result of the FASB accounting standards update on compensation and retirement benefits,neg,train
We anticipate our operational tax rate to be consistent with 2017 and will be between 35% and 40%,neg,train
"Rate depends on market prices and earnings and many tax jurisdictions, and this rate incorporates our current understanding of the U",neg,train
"In Alumina, we had internal records for global energy efficiency and production records at our 3 largest refineries",neg,train
We also achieved nameplate capacity for 1 month at the end of the year in our Saudi Arabian joint venture,neg,train
And then the second question is around the timing of potential capital return to shareholders,neg,train
"I guess when are you going to -- how periodically will you assess this? Will this be something that you'll do at the end of the year with excess cash, something you'll do every quarter, every 6 months? I just want to know what's the timing there?",neg,train
And last one from me and I'll get back in the queue after that,neg,train
"The aluminum sensitivity in the back, it's gone down to 203 for every $100 change from 215",neg,train
"So the difference is probably just ABI, or is there some additional cost baked in?",neg,train
Do you think it's likely you'll initiate a dividend policy this year?,neg,train
We refocused our global company and operations driving accountability and with faster decision-making,neg,train
"Our efforts on operational excellence produced annual production records across our Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminum segments",neg,train
"In Bauxite, we initiated exports from Western Australia and, in 2017, achieved third-party sales from all of our major mining operations",neg,train
"And then just my second and last question, as far as inventories, we've been seeing aluminum ingot inventories rising in China",neg,train
"And then at the same time, we've been seeing alumina prices, it looks like, stabilizing somewhat on declining port inventories",neg,train
I just wanted to see if you guys can maybe speak to inventory levels briefly and maybe how we're setting up going into 2018 relative to what -- how we entered 2017 and how you guys are thinking about that,neg,train
"And so clearly the first option is a zero-sum game, someone swaps their permit",neg,test
"The second option, you're saying you cut for every 1",neg,train
"2 tonnes of older capacity, then you can restart -- I'm just trying to get a sense if the second option is also a zero-sum or how that works",neg,train
The next question comes from Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"So just to be clear, if you take the full year '17 adjust for metal prices, adjust for API, back out the forex impact of rising currencies and then back out the raw materials of $400 million, you should get very, very close to that range of $2",neg,train
Our next question is from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"In Aluminum, we restructured and simplified our organizational structure, successfully restarted our Portland aluminum smelter in Australia and began the partial restart of the Warrick smelter in Indiana",neg,train
"This project is moving quickly, and we're on track to complete the restart in the second quarter of 2018",neg,test
Their combined estimated return over expected project life is an IRR of approximately 50%,neg,train
"Similarly, for 2018, roughly $95 million of our approximately $150 million expected return-seeking spend is for major projects to be substantially completed in 2018",neg,train
The high return projects are across all of our business units and around the world,neg,train
And the first one is I appreciate your perspective on China and certainly the step downs are compelling,neg,train
"But I was wondering, are analysts in China a bit worried about 5 million tonnes of alumina capacity coming back online? And lower alumina prices means the aluminum producers, as you mentioned, are making a margin again",neg,train
These high aluminum and alumina prices seem to be inviting new capacity or talk of new capacity not just in China,neg,train
But this morning there was an article in AMM on a new producer starting up potentially in the U,neg,train
A drought caused our Juruti mine on the Amazon River to experience an acute water shortage that constrained our bauxite washing capacity with follow-on impacts to our Brazilian São Luís refinery,neg,test
"Second, that same drought also affected profits from the Brazilian hydropower system",neg,train
"Third, in Spain, where we are exposed to market power pricing, our smelting system experienced significantly higher power prices",neg,train
"Finally, we have lower-than-expected global alumina shipments due to weather delays and difficulties with shiploading",neg,train
"While some of these impacts were unforeseen shifts in the market, others highlight opportunities to improve our operating system",neg,train
We have taken actions to address those items within our control and avoid this from recurring,neg,train
"Actually, can I just go back to the first question, if I may? You said that the $400 million is versus full year '17? But then when we were talking about the guide of 3",neg,train
"3 -- sorry, the guide, if you annualize what's in the fourth quarter, right, you then will kind of take off $400 million for cost",neg,train
"But that $400 million increase should be less than versus 4Q, right, because cost was rising all year",neg,train
"Again, I don't know if you -- do you kind of see where I'm going? Like I see sort of an inconsistency there",neg,train
"And to bookend it a little bit, we restarted Portland this year",neg,train
"And I think from start to finish, it took us about 6 months in Portland",neg,test
"Warrick had been down for a while and was in worse shape, but it's going to take us nine months from start to finish in Warrick to restart it",neg,train
"So Becancour is bigger than both of those, but it's also newer",neg,train
We expect stable levels of return-seeking and sustaining capital expenditures estimated at a combined $450 million,neg,train
And we will make our last DOJ and SEC payments of $74 million in the month of January,neg,train
"So this month, that will be done and behind us",neg,train
"If you simply take the fourth quarter and annualize it, you have to factor in the guidance around higher raw material cost",neg,train
So we are guiding to approximately $400 million of higher raw material costs,neg,train
"And then also, the fourth quarter would have seen higher alumina prices, and so the alumina assumption that we've built in is lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"And then the other -- I guess, the other major impacts, metal prices ride along the same lines, and currencies -- with the dollar weakening, currencies are a negative impact also in the guidance",neg,train
"So as far as the volume question goes, we're seeing creep in both the bauxite and on the alumina side, so we're going to pick up some incremental volume there",neg,train
"But we've also built in -- on the aluminum side, we've built in the Becancour curtailment for the full year",neg,train
"So we have that running at 1 line, which essentially loses 200,000 tonnes of volume out of the numbers",neg,train
So we will watch cash flow come in during the course of the year,neg,train
So the negative impact of Becancour is built in to the $2,neg,test
We just reviewed for the two most recent market extensions in Memphis and Chattanooga and that’s the methodology that we are now deploying in Carolinas and Virginia,neg,train
"I always feel compelled to hit on this point, when you think about what we just talked about, the growth potential really is extraordinary and I think would be a [indiscernible] for our shareholders that that’s all we do is optimize that opportunity",neg,train
"That’s helpful and then the tax benefit will be a positive to the ROA, I guess as you kind of go back [indiscernible]?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
"The rest of my questions have been answered, thanks so much",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust,neg,train
I would say 12% is a good number for them,neg,train
"I don't know exactly what I have in their plan for next year, but it all will be somewhere in the 70 [ph]",neg,train
"And then on the C&I side, I heard you when you were saying you haven't seen the demand coming out from the tax side, but do you think that tax uncertainty impacted sort of the trends in fourth quarter that we had that we saw on the C&I side in terms of the high levels of pay downs or people not making decision to do much or trying to come in early?",neg,train
"Obviously, one of the keys to anticipating our expense run rate going forward is how quickly the synergy case will be deployed",neg,train
"A critical component of the synergy case was the technology conversion, which Terry has spoke earlier, is now complete",neg,test
"As a result, we continue to believe our synergy case will largely be fully deployed in the first quarter of 2018",neg,train
"Yes, Catherine we have - we get a lot of inbound calls from your colleagues on the other side of the wall about the sub-debt market that was wide open and pricing is very good right now on all that staff, but I guess where we are is, we'd rather not - we want to see if we can press the needle as Terry is talking about right now and just seeing if we can kind of maintain our own growth curve as it currently exists with the subject we have on the books",neg,train
We think we will generate a lot of capital this year to help support that commercial real estate book,neg,train
"I think as it relates to your question, have we seen increased loan demand as a result of the tax law change, my honest answer to that is not yet",neg,train
"I believe all along, once you get the tax rate firm that people know what the rate is and when it is effective that will begin the [indiscernible] and so I do have an expectation it will get benefit from the tax law change and you will see some escalation in loan demand, but candidly, I couldn't say that I have seen thus far",neg,train
"As I indicated before, I’d expect, it may take 6-day a quarter before we built into that target range for the fees to asset component",neg,train

"So, Brian let me just back up and say generally we like those targets out, they - if you sort of hit the mid-point of each of the third component ranges, you would hit the mid-point of ROA range",neg,train
"So, operator, we will stop there and be glad to take questions",neg,train
"Harold just going back to the [indiscernible] you talked about the sheet rates being up 10, 15 basis points in November, the other was 75% I guess what was going on with those [indiscernible] suggesting maybe you won’t see as much pressure in the next quarter, I guess is that what you are thinking about?",neg,train
1 million in the fourth quarter and anticipate at least $15 million to $18 million in loan discount accretion in the first quarter of 2018,neg,train
And then maybe one just last housekeeping item following up on David's question on that,neg,train
"Other expense line item, was there anything unusual that cost that jump? I know you said, kind of flattish expense run rate as a whole for 1Q 2018, but just curious about that specific jump and what kind of drove that 4 million [indiscernible]?",neg,train
"Just a broad question about the rural versus the urban markets, Harold do you have sort of a rough estimate of the difference in deposit funding cost between those two markets or types of markets?",neg,train
"So, over the course of the quarter each month during the month, we are watching what those deposit costs are, how they are moving",neg,train
"Obviously, the larger depositors are the ones we hear about more often and so we get that information anecdotally",neg,train
"And then just maybe lastly from me just housekeeping I just want to make sure I understood on the BHG expectations for the year, the net contribution to Pinnacle would be that 12% to 15% year-over-year growth rate?",neg,train
And that is the GAAP margin at fourth quarter or for the full year 2017?,neg,test
"Yes, we think 21% to 22% will be a good number for us in 2018 all things in",neg,train
"Our trades have really worked tireless to get that transaction done, completed all the systems converted during the fourth quarter 2017",neg,train
They aren’t really consistent with the timeline that we laid out at the beginning,neg,train
We now believe that we’re fundamentally through with producing the synergy case that we had originally indicated,neg,train
"There are a few associates that are still on the payroll that will depart early in the first quarter, having now stabilized the systems and all those kinds of things",neg,train
"Perhaps are a few market related charges in the first quarter as well, but generally all the work has been done",neg,train
"Thus far in 2017, including the $330 million of net organic loan growth, the Bank of North Carolina posted prior the merger the two firms have produced net loan growth in an excess of $1",neg,train
"As the chart indicates, our loan yields decreased slightly to 4",neg,train
"91% last quarter, excluding the impact of purchase accounting, core loan yields were basically flat at 4",neg,train
"Thus, we don’t anticipate significant increases in the duration of our portfolio",neg,test
Our Barbeau [ph] strategy for a better flattening yield curve,neg,train
"We anticipate that this strategy should impact our net interest margin in 2018, positively by 425 basis points",neg,train
"You talked about your CRE concentration and given that the strength, you know BNC is expertise in CRE, you’re expecting that concentration to actually go up near term, but then diminish going forward",neg,train
I just kind of wanted to hear how you plan on doing that,neg,train
"Hi, I wanted to just follow up one more time on the core margin outlook from here, does that - I guess the commentary for holding both the core and GAAP margin relatively flat, does that assume any further interest rate increases this year?",neg,train
Our place holder as of this minute is approximately $8 million pretax,neg,train
Can you talk about the incentive system for growing core deposits from the line all the way up to the C-suite?,neg,train
"2%, while our core efficiency ratio, excluding merger-related charges and/or expense was 47",neg,train
Our fourth quarter total noninterest expense increase amounted to $13,neg,train
"First, concerning personnel costs, we’ve got 2,100 FTEs at December quarter-end, of which 844 are signed with the Carolinas and Virginia",neg,train

Today’s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on Pinnacle’s website for the next 90 days,neg,train
"At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode",neg,train
The floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation,neg,train
The way we are choosing to present the impact of the tax act is to use the pro forma method that is as if the tax act was implemented at the first part of 2017 with the tax rates pursuant to the new tax laws,neg,train
"We've considered in this calculation the various non-deductible items that would have come out of the Tax act, which negates some of these savings",neg,test
"We think that number if had been deployed in 2017, we would have saved $33",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Mealor with KBW,neg,train
"Yes, I think Nancy, I will think about it this way",neg,train
"In other words, it was run as if it were almost a standalone mortgage company",neg,train
And the vast majority of the production in that company came directly from those mortgage originators in their personal contacts,neg,train
"As we look out into 2018 in your crystal ball, how do you think about loan growth",neg,train
"What regions do you expect to see the more strength and have you seen any increased demand thus far from tax reform in your pipeline and pay downs were also expected to be heavy in the fourth quarter, how is that trending?",neg,train
"Yes, let me talk about the volume side of that first and then let Harold comment on sub-debt component of the question there",neg,train
"I think on the CRE side [indiscernible] you know what are these growth for the company ought to be that’s a pretty dramatic growth rate you know generally what we do for a dividend buyout, which is modest",neg,train

"Looking at those non-GAAP measures, adjusting for the merger-related expenses, the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and loss associated with the restructuring of roughly $300 million in our bond book",neg,test
"Since [indiscernible] nicely floats in the right direction, I won't walk through each metric",neg,train
"2 million shares in January 2017, totaling $192 million in net proceeds",neg,train
"Net, net we think 2017 would add increased earnings of approximately $0",neg,train
43 per fully diluted shares with an annual effective tax rate of approximately 22%,neg,train
"So here we go, it is a great time to be at Pinnacle",neg,train
"In 2017, we added 77 revenue producers to our roster, 27 of those where in the BNC markets and that’s 13 of those 27 since the closing of the merger",neg,train
"Yes, we think that the core NIM decrease is primarily attributable to increased funding cost",neg,train
"So, it was on the - we believe it is on the funding side Steve",neg,train
"Hi Jennifer, I might just add a little color to Harold comments",neg,train
"Just as a reminder, 100% of the associates in this firm participate in annual cash incentives, excluding commission based people, so everybody is participating in annual cash incentives, but we all make our number the same way from the bottom of the organization to the C-suite, everybody is eyeing that three things, we have got to clear nonperforming assets threshold, we have got to grow our earnings and we have to grow our revenues",neg,train
"They will grow the top line, grow the bottom line and maintain strong asset quality",neg,train
"And if we do that all our associates participate in the annual cash payout to target, if we overachieve they get more, but if we underachieve they get less",neg,train
"And finally, last just [indiscernible] question, was there anything in the investment security the investment services line that’s kind of temporary this quarter that was a little bit higher than we had modelled, or is that a good run rate to grow from next year?",neg,train
"You said about 75% of your interest-bearing deposits are negotiated rates, can you just talk about specifically give us some color on what you did during the quarter in terms of rate adjustments and secondly can you talk about the incentives for core deposit growth all the way up the line to the C-suite?",neg,train
I don't know what we have as far as funding cost as some of our smaller markets,neg,train
"If you could circle back on the expenses on the compensation cost, you were saying that the benefit from some of the headcount reduction in fourth quarter will probably be offset by some of the seasonality of going into first quarter, shall we see that shall we see that then come down with those 40-additional people come offline when we lose some of that accelerated FICA cost? Should you see second quarter salaries and benefits decline for the third quarter?",neg,train
"Jared that’s an interesting question, I guess specific answer to the question is, I don’t know",neg,train
I guess this is a sort of personal opinion and kind of feel,neg,train
I do believe that uncertainty has weighed on loan demand here in 2017,neg,test
"I think I have said this before and I know if it gets when, I guess Sandler's conference in November last year",neg,train
I guess 2016 people wanted to know if loan demand had increased in the first week since Trump was elected and of course you know it doesn’t work like that,neg,train
"But I don’t think we ever saw a real increase in loan demand in sort of the first year, the new administration, I do think that was primarily a function of just an uncertainty around the tax law",neg,train
"But I guess to your question is, is that it account for any slowing in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"Before we begin, Pinnacle does not provide earnings guidance or forecasts",neg,train
"During this presentation, we may make comments, which may constitute forward-looking statements",neg,train
"All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other facts that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Pinnacle Financial to differ materially from any results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements",neg,train
"I think you guys don't have the disclosure in the queue just in terms of your asset sensitivity from here with the combined to franchises, can you just help us, you know how much of the loan portfolio repriced with December and how much actual benefit are you getting from each incremental rate hike?",neg,train
The hiring during or since the completion of the merger is on that pace,neg,train
I guess there have been C&I banker specifically hired in the last five months,neg,test
And now we are talking with Rick that since year-end team [indiscernible] have been added and the pipeline looks strong,neg,test
"I guess, I would just conclude with this out there, really all the information we have provided really comes back to this point, we are focused on long-term shareholder value",neg,train
"That’s really what we do, simply said, we have got higher growth model that has proven",neg,train
"Okay and then just finally from me on the securities restructuring, we have got - mostly on the meaning side, mostly on the mortgage side and I have been hearing you're saying that you changed duration, but did you change product type at all? And then with the stuff that is so well to do where do you expect to see that going up?",neg,train
"And just a last thing from me, maybe I missed it when you guys mentioned it but the, you talked about the 64 people Terry you kind of monitor that going forward, how many, maybe I missed it, but of the 64 how many are in board already or currently?",neg,train
"And have you - Terry this is probably a question for you, do you expect that you are going to be able to make sort of a significant difference in the trajectory of growth between, you know the rural markets and the urban markets because one of the questions when you what BNC was look at all the rural markets therein, are they going to dampen their growth et cetera et cetera",neg,train
"Just going back to easy question on the margin just you talked about being kind of flat, is that flat in the full-year 2017 level or is the fourth quarter kind of - in the fourth quarter GAAP number?",neg,train
Revenues excluding securities losses for the quarter increased from $216 million in the third quarter to almost $220 billion in the fourth quarter,neg,train
3 million during the quarter thus offset the overall spread increase,neg,train
"As always, the dark green line in the chart denotes revenue per share",neg,train
80 adjusted revenue per share in Q3 and are reporting $2,neg,train
"Switching now to noninterest income, fees amounted to $36 million, compared to $43 million in the third quarter",neg,train
"Our residential mortgage group had another outstanding quarter in terms of production with approximately $290 million in loan sales this quarter, and a yield spread of 2",neg,test
"However, the contributions in the fourth quarter was down from 3Q, primarily due to the seasonality of their funded pipeline",neg,train
This typically incurs occurs at this time of the year before the ramp-up occurs in the spring,neg,train
We’ve got about 40 jobs left to come out for the synergy case to be fully realized,neg,train
"We’ve always believed that revenue growth, earnings growth and asset quality are the three metrics most tightly correlated with share price performance, and so that’s really the focus of the slide",neg,train
"Companies that grow tangible book value typically grow their share price, companies that consistently produce well above median ROTCEs typically trade well above medium PE multiples and so-forth",neg,train
"Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but wanted to follow-up just on the commercial real estate conversation, so is there, I guess how do you think this could - could managing to this 300% level impacted growth in any ways you know maybe in the latter half of the year, and if not is something that you may consider as a way to stay under the 300% level is growth really to take off as it seems like it will?",neg,train
"So, from here I guess that core NIM do you think it will be flattish from here is that kind of your…",neg,train
"And then maybe another clarification question here, in terms of the expenses it sounds like the 104-core rate that you guys had, the core number you had this quarter that seems to be a pretty good number, I guess for the near-term, you know in terms of expenses and increment 104 should it hold pretty steady with the caveat that that increases with as you bring in additional talent or how should we think about that 104 number going forward?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research,neg,train
"Okay, so that kind of 16 million is probably the right run rate moving forward?",neg,train
Concerning loans in the chart indicate average loans for the fourth quarter were $15,neg,train
"5 billion, compared to 15 billion at the end of the third quarter, or an increase of $500 million in average loan balances or an annualized growth rate of better than 13%",neg,train
"We believe we had a strong fourth quarter, particularly in Tennessee where we saw increased loans of $308 million and the Carolinas and Virginia, their organic loan growth was approximately $66 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $61 million in the third quarter",neg,train
"We’ve retrained every person in that footprint with a significant amount of training on the upgrade because even though they were on the Jack Henry SilverLake, they weren't on the current version and the new version required procedural modifications and so forth, and so it is just an extraordinary amount of change that requires an internal focus, which I think would be the principal driver",neg,train
"It is a fact that the pay downs have been higher than usual as we just don't see or read as well, but our expectations for the growth in 2018 is significantly higher than their growth in 2017, and again the budgets have been built that reflect that and so forth",neg,train
"Those non-GAAP measures are adjusted for merger-related expenses invested in gains and losses to sales on security and the revaluation of our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter, as a result of the tax law change",neg,train
I might just comment quickly on the target range for each of those measures,neg,train
"I’d just comment quickly, I guess made this point the time to coming down to the presentation, but I want to reiterate that we have completed the integration of BNC",neg,train
"It has been a way over here to announce the transaction early to get it approved closed and now fully implement as a great thing as Harold mentioned, we are fundamentally through the synergy case, a few jobs left and that will be departed during first quarter for the synergy case, they fully realize, but again the work has been done",neg,train
I mean we don’t have any kind of one off programs to provide people additional incentive for just core deposits,neg,test
Our incentive system is based totally on what core earnings are and what revenues are,neg,train
"If you look in the legacy Pinnacle footprint, the mortgage originators here and as a rule we will generally get at least half their production from referral from bankers",neg,train
"In other words, the bankers control these clients and therefore we will have opportunities to look at mortgage request or able to hand those to our mortgage origination staff",neg,test
"And so that swing is a big swing in the case of BNC to harvest because they have, as you know a great client set that has been virtually and test",neg,test
"You know, we use a methodology here where generally people are forecasted in the quarter at a time, and so the general focus is on what you - what are the high gaining items that are supposed to occur in a 90-day period, and so you rebuild that forecast at the beginning of each quarter",neg,train
"And then underneath that as you know, we in conjunction with the BNC transaction and I guess there were either 9 or 10 offices that were closed",neg,train
"As to the 7-basis point increase, wholesale funding did drop a lot of the increase, while deposit cost were up 5 basis points",neg,train
"As for the future, deposit costs will continue to increase at a measured pace for several factors",neg,train
"The two most prominent are general pressure from increased deposit rates and a rising rate environment, we also need to fund a significant loan pipeline",neg,train
Our relationship managers were out in the market selling our ability to serve commercial and affluent consumer depositors with a value equation we think is far superior to our competitors,neg,train
We are elated with $856 million in increased core deposits for the quarter endpoint to endpoint,neg,train
"I think the issue, as it relates to the concentration is generally focused on total risk-based capital in the 100% and 300% guidelines, and so it has been our intent just generally at the firm to stay underneath those two concentration guidelines, and I think what we tried to say here is that in the most recent quarter we had the $31 million revaluation on the deferred tax asset and $8",neg,train
3 million charge on the boundary structure and so those obviously shrink capital that’s an unplanned shrinkage in capital,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Martin with FIG Partners,neg,train
"So, pay downs have been very high in the fourth quarter and we do expect that to continue here in the first half of 2018",neg,test
"Okay, and then just a couple of other housekeeping in terms of, you talked about the losses on the capital market, how much of an impact was that, is that meaningful in the number is it - so that we have that?",neg,train
"So, again, we just highlight that and try to draw a clear parallel for you",neg,train
I think I want to make one more clarification for you just to again try and set the stage as we go forward,neg,train
I think what we wanted - there is about 40 jobs left to come out of the footprint over there,neg,train
Many of the jobs did come out at the end of December,neg,train
"So, I think as you look forward into the first quarter and our expense run rate, we think our expense run rate is going to be fairly flat",neg,train
"What we do here, as you might expect is, we will give all the races and all that kind of stuff in the first quarter so you will see the legacy footprint and see increased personnel cost from personnel expenses so and so forth",neg,train
I’m not showing any further questions in queue at this time,neg,test
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference",neg,train
This concludes the program and you may now disconnect at this time,neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Will Curtiss with Piper Jaffray,neg,train
"With that, I’m now going to turn the presentation over to Mr",neg,train
"Okay, and I just have another question on mortgage banking, I mean it looks like or it sounds like you guys are really projecting sort of a step-up in growth there",neg,train
"Obviously, our goal is to continue increase our revenue per share over time",neg,test
"As to purchase accounting as many of you know, purchase accounting will be impacted for an extended period of time, but should gradually lessen over time",neg,train
We have approximately $163 million in loan discount accretion of which a significant amount is expected to amortize over the next two to three years,neg,train
"And then just on, you talked about the mortgage revenue fourth quarter being weak based on kind of the outlook, when you look at it - similarly like BHG when you look at the year-over-year growth in mortgage, kind of your expectations, I mean is there a similar range as the BHG when you look at full year mortgage for 2017 versus 2018?",neg,train
"I think the call through integration, I would say it is well underway and has gone extremely well",neg,train
"On this next slide, we have used it for a number of quarters, I like to go back to it because it is instructive",neg,train
"As most of you know, we have conducted a strategic planning process each year in the third quarter",neg,test
"This year, we plan to focus on the remainder of 2017 through 2020 and this year's three-year plan we didn’t alter the overall target range for ROAA, it remained at the 1",neg,train
"5% level, but we did as a result of the business mix changes associated with our BNC acquisition adjust the target range for margin up to a range of 360 to 380, expenses to assets down to a range of 1",neg,train
"0, and the fees to assets down to a range of 0",neg,train
"Salary costs are down approximately $1 million from the third quarter of 2017, which was attributable to a reduction in the Carolina and Virginia footprint as the synergy case was being deployed",neg,train
"Those of you that have followed our story for many years know how our 2017 [ph] plan system works and is based on corporate results, not based on individual sales goals",neg,train
"Yes, I think - so you’re right, I think the production and the net production in the latter half of 2017 was less than a production in the first half 2017, but Steve I guess I would may be try to help you think about what’s going on in that footprint, we have changed all the size, we have shut down 8 to 10 houses, we rolled out new computer software for every person in that system refreshed all their - not computer software, but the computer itself, the PCs",neg,train
So that incremental hiring would accelerate the growth rate over there,neg,train
We think this core NIM is going to be fairly flat,neg,train
We think the GAAP NIM is probably going to be fairly flat,neg,test
"I wouldn't think it would be different in the fourth quarter versus quarter 3, 2, or 1 as it relates to just the uncertainty itself",neg,train
"Jared, I'll say this, I don't really want to spend a lot of time on politics other than say the demand and political discourse is difficult and choppy and changes every day",neg,test
"And so, I think that, well I believe you will see increased loan demand as a result of the tax law",neg,test
"I did think there is just such volatility and headline risk that it's hard for people to really get comfortable and say, okay, I think things are solid, let’s go",neg,train
"As expected, we are reporting banker sales here in group revenues of $12",neg,test
3 million or almost 50% from the fourth quarter of 2016,neg,train
"Nancy if I can be honest, I don’t know the answer to that question",neg,train
I know that it is substantially larger than where we are now,neg,train
"But yes, I'd be hesitant just to throw a number out there without having a little more structured analysis behind",neg,train
"So, I am not sure I am really prepared to give you an answer to that question",neg,train
Speaking of the banking clients as supposed to the mortgage clients,neg,test
"And so, to your question about market share that is generally I believe market share is, we hire additional people who have books of business or client contacts from a separate source and so it is a market share move play",neg,train
"Nancy, I guess I would say two or three things",neg,train
Well there is a couple of things going on in that number in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"One is, that there is a kind of an annual number in there",neg,train
"I don't think it was so a large number, I want to say it was $400,000 or something like that that we get annually, but I think that program has suspended so it is not going to repeat, but I think the larger number or the more important thing are the hires that we got out of SunTrust in October",neg,train
Those people have hit the ground running and they are here in Nashville and so that number is being impacted by that group that is building the book of a pretty sizable amount during the fourth quarter and will continue to build it for next year,neg,train
"So, we had a partial quarter impact to those additional shares in Q1 fourth quarter impact in Q2, and as you can see it is now escalating quickly already back to a 16",neg,train
"Secondly, just below the ROTCE chart, the tangible book value chart, as I have already commented on this call, correlation between tangible book and share prices is obvious",neg,train
"So, on this slide, I just might say, we’re looking at the two most recent market extensions Memphis and Chattanooga, we were not in those markets in 2014",neg,train
"We entered those markets in 2015, and so if you look at the second column from the right you can see how many revenue producers we have there at the bottom of each of those markets with a baseline for core deposits was at the end of 2015 and what the base line for loans was at the end of 2015 for both of those markets",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Stafford with Stephens,neg,train
Well I think it is the true stage that we’re expecting to see in our line of growth faster than the CRE,neg,train
"And again, going back to this idea that’s where the hiring focus is",neg,train
"Yes Jared, I think you will see some of that as we look at our plan for 2018, our expense line, we don't think is going to deviate very much quarter-to-quarter",neg,train
The blue part of the slide was basically discussed last night in the press release,neg,train
"Excluding merger expenses and investment securities losses and the deferred tax revaluation loss, we think 2017 was about 3",neg,train
"57 fully diluted EPS kind of the year, basically about 16% growth rate over last year",neg,train
"Okay on the first question on funds, on funding cost, we did adjust sheet rates in November",neg,train
"I believe at the end of October, I think we raised sheet rates 15 basis points, 20 basis points during that time and Jennifer what was the second question?",neg,train
Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Sandler O’Neill,neg,train
"My last question is on NIM, I know we beat this subject to death, but Harold just a clarification, so if the GAAP margin is going to be essentially flat doesn't that mean there needs to be some expansion in the core margin to offset the lower accretion?",neg,train
"(NASDAQ:PNFP) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 17, 2018  9:30 AM ET",neg,train
"All right and then, this is the last one from me and in the slides tax rate, I think you had 22% in your pro forma exercise their slide 13, is that what you are assuming would guide us to use for the tax rate going forward 22%?",neg,train
"I think it was about - run rate difference was about $700,000, I believe",neg,test
"Okay that makes sense, and then in 1Q, I mean do you think we will see more, I mean will we see disproportionately more than a 7-basis point increase, could that be more like 12 to 14 just with the rate hike or…?",neg,train
"Question for you, I guess maybe more for Harold on the core NIM, Harold, I was thinking, you had said after last quarter, we would see flat or maybe increasing core NIM, and I’m wondering what kind of changed during the quarter that led to the downside there, and maybe, I know you spoke a little bit on the 7 basis points of higher deposit cost, but that obviously came in a quarter where we saw no fed rate hikes",neg,train
I’m wondering on your thoughts on deposit costs next quarter with the impact of the Fed hike,neg,train
"Yes, you’re right on that, but I don't think you don't see meaningful movement throughout the course of this year either way on that",neg,train
We just are planning to depend this core margin for the rest of this year,neg,test
"Well seven through 1231, I think we've actually hired a couple since year-end as well, but probably the way to keep track of it is just think about three quarter ends seven, I guess in the first five months",neg,train
"In the right most column, you can see the growth rates between 2015 and 2016, which where substantial, and again I would just start to hit the bottom looking at the growth rate for the hiring revenue producers and again as you move up the chart is not surprising you generate loan and deposit growth",neg,train
"Generally, consistent with the kind of success in general on the revenue producers",neg,train
"So, without any of that organic growth and so forth",neg,test
"My guess is that you could probably do another $20 billion in assets with the basic operating platform that we have, but I’m just giving you a guess, Nancy",neg,train
"I don't have a structured analysis behind that, but obviously we will be working on that as far as strategic planning process",neg,train
"Pinnacle Financial disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise",neg,train
"In addition, these remarks may include certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G",neg,train
"So, Harold, I’ll stop there with overview and let you take further details",neg,train
"Again, I would say that the third quarter was a strong loan and deposit growth quarter",neg,train
The deposit growth was a highlight in particular and I think most of you heard me talk about this in the past,neg,train
"Harold, can we just go back real quick, in terms of the core NIM thoughts, I think you said, the 333 you expect to hold that flat in the first quarter and then if I heard correctly, the securities purchase will add another 4 basis points to 5 basis points throughout the course of the year, is that correct?",neg,train
The mid-December Fed funds rate increase did help our core loan yield slightly and should drive a core rate increase in the first quarter of 2018 that we anticipate to be 5 basis points to 10 basis points,neg,train
"As to the deposits, again here in the fourth quarter we were able to grow our funding base, while maintaining low funding costs",neg,train
Our aggregate funding cost did increase 7 basis points in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and currently stands at 73 basis points for the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Yes, we’ve got three increases in our plan, one early part of the year, one mid-year and one at the end of the year",neg,train
"And on the North Carolina, kind of Virginia franchise growth, I know I think 2Q growth was like $190 million in the last two quarters have been in the low to mid 60s, what’s the main driver at change there, is that just more rapid CRE payoffs, is that some sort of just mind shift change or pricing changes relative to what BNC used to do or - and I guess more importantly is that 190 million range something we can expect you to get back to at any point soon or is that kind of the longer term goal once the C&I folks come online",neg,train
We continue to anticipate the net growth of BAC in 2018 should be in the 12% to 15% range,neg,train
"We did see a decrease in other non-interest income in the fourth quarter, due primarily to losses on venture capital investments and a reduction in capital market advisory fees during the quarter",neg,train
That number should stabilize in the first quarter of 2018,neg,test
"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Pinnacle Financial Partners Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call",neg,train
Hosting the call today from Pinnacle Financial Partners is Mr,neg,train
"As most of you know, this quarter was immediately impacted by pretax merger-related charges of $19",neg,train
"3 million, and after-tax charges related to the revaluation of our firm’s deferred tax assets of $31",neg,train
"So, as I say each quarter at least for me given all of the transition, the merger integration, and now the tax law changes the non-GAAP measures that takes these realities into account actually provide greater insight into the core run rates on these important measures, so let me move to those quickly",neg,test
"In conjunction with the ROAA target, we continue to publish the targets for the four key components that lead to that overall level of profitability and specifically I’m talking about the margin, the expenses to assets, the fees to assets and the net charge-offs",neg,train
"And so, as you can see on this slide, which reflects both the GAAP and the non-GAAP measurements fourth quarter 2017 was another good quarter with a non-GAAP return on average assets at 1",neg,train
"36%, and with the exception of the fees to assets, the component measures are all performing pretty well against the targets",neg,train
Those obviously have followed our current [indiscernible] length of time those are coming out of recession back in 2011,neg,train
I think over the years that we have achieved the initial targets,neg,train
"We have actually increased our ROA target twice, since then to its current level of 1",neg,train
"Yes, I think what you'll see is probably less of our bond book in mortgage backs",neg,train
We will probably see a little increase in the municipals and more into some floating rate security,neg,train
"So, other than that it is not going to be a big change Jared",neg,train
"As you can see in 2017, hired 77 revenue producers and finished the year with a non-GAAP efficiency ratio of roughly 47%, and 1",neg,train
"So again, just trying to clarify that we don’t view the adding of people to begin expense bill would view it to be a revenue bill",neg,train
"And then how does the pipeline, how does the C&I pipeline look now as we are going into the first quarter?",neg,train
"We were about 38 million for the year, so we’re targeted to about 12% to 15%",neg,train
"Yes, we are looking at our GAAP margins for our plan are to be fairly flat for the rest of the year",neg,train
We’re not seeing a whole lot of dilution of our GAAP margins,neg,train
"As to investment securities losses, during the fourth quarter, we sold approximately $300 million in securities at a loss of $8",neg,train
"More sales are likely, but we don’t anticipate any meaningful P&L gain or loss from those sales in the first quarter",neg,train
We anticipate buying back into the market this quarter such that bond should approach 2,neg,train
"We anticipate continued increases in short rates, while loans rate may remain relatively stable, thus a flatter yield curve",neg,train
We believe this deal has great revenue synergies that were not included in the 10% accretion target that we’ve already disclosed and now believe we will deliver and that is an important aspect how we drop them out to our revenue fees to asset and target that we talked about earlier in the call,neg,train
Congratulations on getting BNC in fully integrated and all that,neg,train
It’s exciting and it sounds that things are progressing well,neg,train
"I just wanted to get your best estimate of how much of that, if you can quantify, how much of the $40 million cost save estimate is already in your run rate? Given that the technology conversion happened late in the fourth quarter, I would suspect that there is a pretty decent step down still left to actually hit the first quarter numbers? And I guess there is a follow on, was there anything one-time in nature in that other expense line item that kind of popped up in the quarter?",neg,train
Thanks guys appreciate it and congrats on a great year,neg,train
"Yes, what drove is for FDIC and franchise tax expenses and so those numbers stabilize going into the first quarter of next year",neg,train
"So, we have a little extra money accrued to those at the end of December",neg,train
"That 104 is probably a good run rate for us based on what we have in our plan, which includes additional hires",neg,test
If we are able to exceed our revenue goals that number is going to go with increased incentive cost,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Feaster with Raymond James,neg,train
"You will remember that in the third quarter, we were recurring at less than targeted levels, but we continue to work during the fourth quarter and got those reduced incentives back into our P&L in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"Just to emphasize the point, incentive expense and earnings are indirectly linked",neg,train
"If we hit our revenues and earnings targets, our incentive costs will increase",neg,train
"Additionally, we will now go back and recalibrate the targets in-light of the Tax Job act, expecting further meaningful lift in the ROAA target range",neg,train
"I might just comment here, fourth quarter 2017 was a huge quarter in the history of our firm",neg,train
"And I would just say that we did that and a lot of companies run the score cards that I think it produced outcomes like what we saw at Wells Fargo and I would say they are not the disparity I’m just saying it is drives people to worry about this product this cross-sell, this sort of thing",neg,train
"You know, the number one revenue item we have is loan growth",neg,train
You know we give them the funding percentage that we'll accept for noncore,neg,train
You got to produce this in core deposit and people will go out and build initiatives together core deposit,neg,train
"So, there are plenty of incentives in the system, but it is not tied specifically to that number",neg,train
"Yes, we are not planning for that kind of increase going into the first quarter of next year, but we should see measured increases in funding cost for the rest of the year",neg,train
We appreciate you being on the call with us this morning from snowy icy Nashville,neg,train
"We always begin our quarterly earnings call with this dashboard, really two slides",neg,train
The first reflecting the GAAP measures and second reflecting non-GAAP measures,neg,train
We like this dashboard because it quickly analyzes the performance and momentum on virtually all the metrics that we use to drive our business,neg,train
"And then I think Terry talked about this but just those target ranges Terry, you guys kind of going back to revisit those at least on the ROA numbers, tax rate change, but just over the next couple of quarters it sounds like the ranges where raising, especially with the - I guess with the fees being a little bit light, but the others being a little bit strong, that trend kind of plays out the next couple of quarters, but maybe begins to kind of normalize at your targeted range out in maybe six quarters out or four quarters to six quarters out, is that how to think about a three-year kind of stay above the range one being below and [indiscernible]?",neg,train
A more detailed description of these and other risks is contained in Pinnacle Financial’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K,neg,train
We got the benefit of a rate increase in December to help us in the first quarter,neg,test
"What’s going to go against us in the first quarter is, we have got two less days in the first quarter, so that is not helpful, but we think we will be able to defend the margin within rate increase",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
We are getting even in the way we program at a little bit efficiency as the nominal number for 2017 would be higher than that,neg,train
"The number for 2018 will be lower than that, but it’s largely getting the same amount of work done to little less efficiency",neg,train
A little less cost per dollar for programming unit for the lack of better term,neg,train
"And then, you guys mentioned that your commercial customers were optimistic about the future",neg,train
"Can you share with us in the investment bank what the pipeline looks like at the end of the fourth quarter coming into 2018? And then second, within the investment banking division, I think you mentioned you hired 400 bankers",neg,train
"What sectors are you really doing well, and is it healthcare, technology, financial?",neg,train
"This quarter, through the purchase to both the purchase of our common shares and common dividends, we returned more than $6",neg,train
"1 billion in income available to common, which included the $2",neg,train
And we will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies,neg,train
"On the digital side, specifically, we will travel with the customer and we were getting the customers to understand the value of –instead of going to the ATM deposit, do with their phone or instead of going to branch deposit, do it with their phone, but we take it ahead of them we have to walk with them and help them do it and help them grow that 23% number up from three or four years you’d see on the page like the 12%",neg,train
"On Slide 19, we show all other, which reported a loss of $2",neg,train
9 billion impact from the Tax Act was recorded here,neg,train
"So excluding that charge, all other would have produced a profit of a little over $200 million",neg,train
"In Global Banking, loan spreads were down one basis point compared to Q3 2017 continuing the trend we’ve seen all year which modestly compressed spreads year-over-year by mid single-digits",neg,train
"On deposits, just, it’s a very sophisticated question of how you price",neg,train
"We price literally by every market, by every product, by every customer sets",neg,test
"Brian, it was in the Q&A where you’ve alluded to the fact that you expect expenses to be flattish in 2019",neg,test
I just want to confirm whether that’s still a reasonable expectation just because it looks like most people are contemplating some expense ramp from 2018 to 2019,neg,train
"On Slide 7, we break out credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios",neg,train
"With respect to Consumer, net charge-offs of $769 million were up $38 million from Q3",neg,train
"The modest uptick in net losses is negatively impacted by the absence of some prior period recoveries, the Q3 2017 storm-related payment deferrals and seasonality",neg,train
"I guess, just the follow-up and it’s I guess more of a – maybe a little bit more of a philosophical question",neg,train
"So Larry Fink, obviously as you knew, sent a letter indicating that management should look not only at maximizing profitability and return to shareholders but at the social impact of their actions and I think for good reasons you guys take pride in being a good corporate citizen",neg,train
"And then just separately on the retail deposit side, you mentioned, essentially no repricing there",neg,test
"It’s consistent I think with what we are seeing for low figure big peers, but just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of when they – start seeing little bit of upward pressure there and being the biggest deposit player as you might be one of the setters of the price there as we think about rates going forward",neg,train
And we can take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet,neg,train
"I’ll say, it’s been the experience so far has been relatively modest in terms of anything as people have been changing opinion, but, we continue to model the market and we’ll figure out what we want to do, but we haven’t changed our position yet",neg,train
I think it’s too early to give you that sort of guidance,neg,train
I’ve given everything that I want to give you at this point,neg,train
We’ve got the card loans which using a little bit lower,neg,train
"If we get rid of the FTE I don’t know how you look at it and remember that at the end of Q4, there was a run up in the LIBOR anticipation of the rate increases",neg,train
"Switching to average deposits and looking at the bottom right, growth was $43 billion or nearly 3",neg,train
This growth was driven by consumer banking which increased by a $48 billion or nearly 8% year-over-year,neg,train
Average deposits declined year-over-year in wealth management as clients moved cash to other alternatives within brokerage or AUM,neg,train
This decline was mostly offset by solid growth in global banking,neg,train
"So even with the run off of CDs and so, that dynamic is always going to lead to all-in deposit price four basis points looks lower, but it’s the quality of the checking franchise and core franchise we have",neg,train
"I think we had, the average checking balance in consumer reached $7000 this quarter",neg,train
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Bank of America Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Announcement",neg,train
Later there will be an opportunity to ask questions during the question answer session,neg,train
I don’t think it will change the way we run the company,neg,train
"We’ve been running it on a responsible growth with the four elements, got to grow no excuses, got it – do it with it on a customer focused organic basis, got to do it with the right risk and got to be sustainable along the best place for people to work drive share our success with communities and drive operational excellence",neg,train
I think we’ll have to think about that when we get there,neg,train
I am not sure for us barriers of largest banks are not going to always be a little more circumspect or whatever the right way would it be in terms of governing our dividend,neg,train
Turning to Slide 12 and focusing on the continued improvement in digital banking trends,neg,train
As you can see the year-over-year growth in these metrics continues to be impressive,neg,test
We now have nearly 35 million digital users including 24 million accessing their accounts through mobile devices,neg,train
The net reserve release reflects continued improvement and our legacy consumer real estate and energy portfolios,neg,train
Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance to loan coverage ratio of 112 basis points and a coverage level of 2,neg,train
"Shareholders not only saw a share price improvement, but we increased our dividend by 60% and reduced our fully diluted share count during the year by 3",neg,test
Average diluted shares were down 370 million from this time last year and down nearly 1 billion from the peak,neg,train
"Okay, turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 10, Q4 caps a tremendous year for this business",neg,train
2 billion growing 14% over 2016 with operating leverage driving the efficiency ratio to 50% by the end of the year,neg,train
"But as you keep in mind, we’ve always been clear that the long-term targets were just a step to keep marking our continued path to driving this company’s operating performance",neg,train
"It’s been running off, the way we haven’t characterized as going forward it’s going to run-off sort of 5 to 6 per quarter, call it five",neg,train
So you have to make sure they are coming in and we use techniques to divide the portfolio to give them deeper client penetration to get the customers for the products for customers,neg,train
That takes time and you just can’t snap your finger,neg,train
"Compared to Q3 2017, expenses declined by $120 million despite the late quarter discretionary spend",neg,train
The decline was driven by a lower mortgage servicing cost and lower revenue-related incentives in our global markets business,neg,train
"Sure, the investment banking pipeline ended the year lower than Q3 mainly due to the completion of some large transactions in Q4 combined with the postponement of or cancelation of some other large transactions",neg,train
"Having said that, again, I think we are very optimistic about 2018 given the Tax Act which, again, has leveled the playing field here",neg,train
And we can take our next question from John McDonald with Bernstein,neg,test
"Excluding the Tax Act’s impacts on revenue, our efficiency ratio of 62% was above our target reflecting the typical seasonal weakness in our sales inflating business",neg,train
I was hoping to follow-up on the outlook for net interest income for the full year and you mentioned some of the drags from the card business,neg,train
"So I guess in the grand scheme of things, I mean, it doesn’t seem like the $500 million drag from card is really that material",neg,train
"One of your peers set a goal of 2% of net income for corporate philanthropy, are you thinking of resetting anything like that?",neg,train
"In 2018, we expect solid NII growth driven by loan and deposit growth in some net interest yield expansion assuming the forward curve plays out as currently expected",neg,train
"But, I would remind you that 2017 included approximately $0",neg,train
5 billion of interest from the UK card business that we sold,neg,train
This will be a significant offset to NII growth in 2018,neg,train
4 billion finished the year strong growing 16% versus Q4 2016,neg,train
"For full year 2017, we ranked number three in overall investment banking fees with fees totaling $6 billion, up 15% from 2016",neg,train
"We may see us that we are moving toward the 30% payout ratio of earnings and I think that would mathematically follow what you just laid out the Tax - tax earnings go up it will be a higher number, so",neg,train
And we will take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW,neg,train
"First, in other income, there was a charge of approximately $950 million to revalue certain renewable energy investments, within the income tax line, this pretax charge was offset by the tax benefits of this $950 million charge, plus the new value of certain deferred tax liabilities associated with these renewable energy investments",neg,train
However we’ll be clear we’d expect most of the benefits and tax reform will flow to the bottom-line through dividends and share buybacks over time,neg,train
"Okay, let me turn it back to Brian for a couple of closing comments before we open it up for Q&A",neg,train
"Within revenue, mortgage banking income was the only major category that was lower year-over-year driven by bond declines",neg,test
"Year-over-year, earnings were down by $238 million driven by lower sales in trading results, higher technology investment spending and provisions",neg,train
Provision expense of $132 million increased from Q4 2016 as a result of a commercial charge-off mentioned earlier,neg,train
Half of the loss was recorded in Global Banking and half in Global Markets,neg,train
Provision expense also included some release of reserves on our energy portfolio which continued to improve,neg,train
We also opened 41 student centers and 69 lending centers and branded 585 Merrill Lynch offices,neg,train
We also renovated nearly 300 financial centers and replaced more than 3400 ATMs,neg,train
And we will take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank,neg,train
"Thank you again, and we look forward to talking to you next time",neg,test
Wanted to drill into the expenses just a little bit to get some clarity,neg,train
"It seems like there was two kind of not unusual, but kind of standout $200 million worth of compensation that would have been in the first quarter now is accelerated into the fourth quarter and then, Brian, you were talking about $200 million of the charitable foundation and the extra bonus payments",neg,train
Just want to make sure those were two separate items and those numbers were correct?,neg,train
"So if you take the entirety of running this system as a percent of deposits which you can benchmark people relatively clear than the industry, you’ll see that we run about a 160 basis and we set the phones, the mobiles, the technology, the people and all that stuff against the deposit base, that has come down over the last seven, eight years from 300 basis points to 161 basis points",neg,train
"Excluding the Tax Act impact, our return on tangible common equity was 11% and our return on average – return on assets was 93 basis points pushing close to our long-term targets",neg,train
"This is going to be, I think all companies, all banks are going to have more – are going to keep more of what they earn",neg,train
"With respect to bond premiums, what I would point out was that in 2017, we had a benefit of approximately $700 million from the lower bond amortization driven by slower prepayments as long end rates moved up at the end of the year, at the end of 2016",neg,train
The remaining decline in equity was mostly result of the decline in OCI as increases in long-end rates decreased the value of our debt securities portfolio,neg,train
We purchased 174 million shares in Q4 and have repurchased 509 million shares in the past twelve months,neg,train
"The latest example is our announcement at the year end, we were able to provide nearly 70% of our teammates with a bonus to share in the future success of the expected benefits of the tax savings",neg,train
"Hopefully, this is simple that I know you can’t talk for the regulators, but all else equal have you thought through to how the Tax Act might impact the CCAR process meaning I see just a lot higher PP&R and it shouldn’t impact anything else in a vacuum, but just curious if I am missing something there?",neg,train
Our company remains balanced with earnings coming relatively evenly from our consumer and our commercial institutional segment businesses,neg,train
"On our more businesses for people, our consumer businesses and our wealth management businesses, together they earn more than $11 billion and grew 14% while our Global Banking and Global Markets business together generated about $10 billion and they are up 7%",neg,train
"Well, we – to be comparable, yet to understand what you are – what the components are, but the component most people focus on is what we call technology initiatives or code and new program and that’s about $2",neg,test
The Consumer credit card net charge-off ratio increased to 2,neg,train
2 billion declined from Q3 and or at the lowest they’ve been since Q2 2008 and 45% of our Consumer NPLs are current on their payments,neg,train
"Commercial losses, excluding the one large credit already discussed were stable",neg,train
Reservable criticized exposure was down more than $1 billion from Q3,neg,test
"By the way, customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached an historic high with roughly 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 at a 10 point scale",neg,train
We remained focused on prime and super prime borrowers with average book FICO scores of at least 760,neg,train
"Year-over-year expenses were up 3% driven by revenue-related incentives, as well as investments in both primary sales professionals and technologies",neg,train
"You’ve got transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, nationwide network, advising council",neg,train
I think all of this plus the lack of market pressure so far has kept deposit rates relatively low,neg,train
Look at some point rates are going to rise and my guess is we are getting close to that point given the expected fed fund rate hikes here in 2018,neg,train
We are not in any way restructuring our securities portfolio,neg,train
"There was a – it’d be very modest, but you find there $22 million loss on some securities we sold in the fourth quarter",neg,train
We got to a nice price that affects our CCAR results and we wanted to get rid of it and we can get to the trade-offs,neg,train
"So it’s very hard fought to get much expense, but even then they’ve still done a good job of taking the expense leverage through the changes and the underwriting ways we do business",neg,train
This is how we underwrite centrally versus decentrally and things like that,neg,train
"And then just last question on the dividend payout ratio, realize that earnings up with the lower tax rate, do you expect you’ll keep that dividend payout ratio flat or how are you thinking about the dividend and then overall capital return?",neg,train
"I think, year-over-year the consumer business grew $47 billion of organic deposit growth",neg,train
"Moving to trends on Slide 18 and looking at trends across the last three years, we would highlight the following",neg,train
"First, starting in the lower left box, full year total trading revenue has been fairly consistent over the last three years at $13 billion to $13",neg,train
And note that we have achieved this stability while reducing our expensed RWA,neg,train
Growth of loans in Global Banking remains fairly consistent with past several quarters increasing 4% year-over-year,neg,train
"The outlook for loan growth given tax reform remains to be seen, but optimum – optimism among our clients is high",neg,train
For the year we reported $18 billion in after tax net income excluding the Tax Act impact of $2,neg,train
"9 billion, we would have reported net income of $21 billion, which is up 18% over a solid 2016",neg,test
This represents the highest earnings run rate for the company in its history,neg,train
We feel that we feel really good about where we are in terms of our securities portfolio,neg,train
"One quick one, just mortgage is a small line, but it had a big obvious swing, $300 million to a negative, especially that other line, can you just talk us through what that couple hundred million dollar negative was in the other part of mortgage and if that’s recurring or just a one-time thing?",neg,train
"But – and then just switching over to wealth management, couple little questions on like, number one is, where is all the growth coming from, meaning you noted the strong flows, curious what’s current versus new clients and you also noted advises are up 3%",neg,train
You can see some of these accolades on the couple of the appendix slides we added to the packets this time,neg,train
This year we also invested heavily in our teammates for improvements and starting minimum wages at where we have put them at $15 this time last year,neg,train
"We had more – we introduced Sabbatical, family leaving increases, leave policy extensions and wellness initiatives",neg,test
"It moves around little bit, but that’s the phenomenon we announced earlier this quarter that we are going to – last quarter we are going to take",neg,train
"It’s not an acceleration, it’s just the way, we’ve done all in one quarter and now spread across four quarters",neg,train
"So, it just seem that the – about the numbers it’s just AUM growth, which is being driven by market levels, it’s being driven by increased flows",neg,train
It’s being driven by some new households and we are very focused on that,neg,train
That’s offset by some – little bit of spreads compression and decline in transaction revenues that we’ve been seeing now for a couple peers,neg,train
If you back out the $200 million in additional bonuses and the accelerated charitable contribution that leaves us just about $13,neg,train
"1 billion, if you multiply that times four and that’s 52 and a quarter or so billion",neg,train
"In our materials, we’ve provided charts reflecting results on a basis that excludes the Tax Act impacts",neg,train
We believe this provides a more clear comparison to Q4 2016,neg,train
"Return on return on tangible common equity was 11%, return on assets was 90 basis points, operating leverage year-over-year was a strong 8%",neg,test
"It’s not – it wasn’t related, Marty, the core of sort of – like we invest the excess deposit proceeds in a given quarter",neg,train
This was legacy stuff we are just trying to clean up,neg,train
"Focusing on risk-weighted assets and starting with the advanced approach, RWA was flat from Q3 at $1",neg,test
46 trillion as DTA reductions and the run-off of legacy loans with high risk weights offset general loan growth,neg,train
"Under the standardized approach where risk sensitivity is less, funded and unfunded loan growth across the businesses drove a $22 billion increase in RWA",neg,train
"Now we expect the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 20% absent unusual items and remember when thinking about tax rate on an FTE basis, the difference in GAAP and FTE has now narrowed from two basis points to one basis point",neg,train
"These are things we are doing long before tax reform came and we will do long before tax reform when tax reforms goes away some day or something that else changes, these are things that makes this company great and as you said, it’s a philosophical viewpoint, but it’s also the public role of banking system with a difference",neg,train
The CET1 ratio under advanced declined 34 basis points to 11,neg,train
5% and the standardized ratio declined 52 basis points to 11,neg,test
5 requirement and supplementing leverage ratios continued to exceed U,neg,train
"One of the things I was anticipating is that banks can actually accelerate the benefit as we do get uptick on the back-end of the curve, but doing some of that aggressive restructuring",neg,test
"So just was curious if you had been kind of thinking of that, or kind of moving in that direction?",neg,train
"Adjusting for these sales, average loans were up $29 billion or 3% year-over-year",neg,train
Loan growth continued to be dampened by the run-off of non-core consumer real estate loans in all other,neg,train
Year-over-year loans in all other were down $29 billion inclusive of the loan sales,neg,train
"Despite downgrades of this credit, both non-performing loans and criticized commercial exposures declined from Q3",neg,train
"And excluding this specific loss, net charge-offs remained very low",neg,test
"They just don’t want us to ever have to cut our dividends and as you do look at it mathematically across time periods, the idea of us not earning 70% of our earnings therefore, i",neg,test
"being able to pay for the dividend at a very low probability and that’s where they came up with that number and I think let’s just be, it will see play out, I don’t know what they’ll do, but our strategy inside the company is continue to move up the dividend on a rational basis along with the earnings to get closer to that number",neg,train
"In addition to cost savings associated with the sale of our UK Card business, year-over-year improvements in non-interest expense will be broadly distributed across expense categories as we continue to focus on SIM, understanding improving our work processes and optimizing the company’s consumer delivery network",neg,train
"Also, NII from loan growth in Q1 is normally muted by seasonal declines in card loans",neg,train
"One other item worth noting as you think about Q1, the Tax Act will lower NII on an FTE basis, because the NII growth up will be lower",neg,test
"However, remember, NII growth up on an FTE basis is completely offset by higher tax expense resulting in no change in earnings",neg,test
"We have kept our levels consistent from before the crisis now about $175 million, $200 million a year and we’ll expect to keep it there",neg,train
"In addition to that we did tremendous volunteer work, 1 million hours a year and other things",neg,train
"I’d say, haven't even done the math lately, but I think that’s 1% after tax at this point",neg,train
"But our view is that, we can have a lot of impact there with ebbs and flows depending on what’s going on at the moment, but I don’t expect us to change that dramatically",neg,train
Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the fully phased-in impacts,neg,train
"The primary cause of the decline was a return of capital to shareholders in excess of earnings, which obviously included the Tax Act impact",neg,train
"You guys have said, take a look at all of these trends collectively on Slide 12, but don’t look at one in isolation",neg,train
"So, what sort of metric should we monitor externally to gauge your progress? Would it be, for example, the consumer banking efficiency ratio or is there one all-in compassing number or how would you suggest that we think about this?",neg,train
"So I was trying to get a little better sense of maybe the magnitude of net – that you are looking for and then if you want to give us the bond premium amortization, how much benefit that was this year versus last might be helpful in the pieces",neg,test
"Your fourth quarter results were good and the outlook looks quite good for you folks, as well as your peers",neg,train
"Can you share with us what risks you are kind of looking out for in the horizon? Obviously, again, things are looking very good for you folks and we always have to watch out from left field for some type of risk",neg,train
Anything that you can identify that you guys are just keeping an eye on?,neg,train
"In the second quarter of 2016, we first announced the scope, I want to remind you that there is the expenses that were trailing at that time of $56 billion",neg,test
"It was on our business plan to hit that $53 billion in 2018, it’s still is",neg,train
"Okay, and then just maybe just one follow-up on the expenses in the 2019",neg,train
1 billion if you back up those two items and then did the math multiplying in times four,neg,train
"I think the acceleration, I think, I still in the way you talk about there as the change to FAS-123 which is that, the simple way to think is, we used to take $1 billion in the first quarter, now we take 2",neg,train
"So there is a lot of step behind it, but, so think about spending $2 billion, $2",neg,train
"5 billion to $3 billion in technology, think us having done that for a long time and think of some of those benefits now coming through",neg,test
"So it’s not like the ethics are expanding to get the mobile behavior, it’s actually a change in customer behavior which is less about the technology, it’s more about getting the customer over the behavior",neg,train
"We weren’t happy with it from the top of the house through to the actual people who are involved in it, but, even with that credit cost year-over-year relatively flat and the team is doing a good job",neg,test
"So we think about all those risks and with cyber risk, you know the list as well as I do, but the question is how do you balance and how do you keep yourself ahead of those, so that you won’t be immune from them, but they’ll impact our company less",neg,train
That is what we define as responsible growth quite frankly,neg,train
The tax rate this quarter was impacted by the negative impacts of the Tax Act as well as the benefit of the unrelated subsidiary restructuring,neg,train
"With respect to tax rate in 2018, prior to tax reforms, we expected our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be around 29% before unusual items",neg,train
I want to go back to Slide 2 to start,neg,train
Late in the quarter we informed investors through an 8-K filing that we expected an impact of approximately $3 billion from the Tax Act,neg,train
"And as one of the largest banks in nine states, we will benefit that – with that as our customers grow and invest",neg,train
"And on the commercial side, we’ve been growing loans at mid single-digits and again, so good to, we have to repatriate funds here in the short-term",neg,train
I don’t see any reason to change our expectation around loan growth,neg,train
"Provision expense was $1 billion, up $227 million, driven by a $333 million impact from the charge-offs and reserve build for a single commercial exposure",neg,train
I would note that seasonally card balance is usually down in the first quarter,neg,train
"Looking at trends on Slide 16 and comparing to Q4 last year, with respect to average loans, growth of 4% was led by corporate borrowers, evenly balanced between domestic and international clients",neg,test
"Within commercial lending, C&I rose 5% while commercial real estate was flat",neg,train
"I think I’d follow-up on the loan side, 6% year-over-year in the core business",neg,train
"Pretty decent rate and you are seeing growth across, just wondering what your expectation is for loan growth are as you look out and in a bigger sense, any sense of just the movement in commercial and corporate America in terms of starting to think about investing more in their businesses?",neg,test
"Yes, look, we expect solid NII growth in 2018 from continued, sort of NIM expansion as well as loan and deposit growth",neg,train
"Yes, I am not sure how helpful I am going to be to you, I would just make a couple of points that we’ve made many times and that the industry really hasn’t seen on the retail side deposit rates increasing sort of much or at all on traditional accounts",neg,train
And I think it’s important just to remind everybody that Bank of America delivers a lot of value to depositors,neg,test
"7 billion declined 9% from Q4 2016, fixed sales and trading of $1",neg,train
"7 billion decreased 13%, with this effect the decrease was driven by less favorable market conditions across macro products particularly rates",neg,train
"And then just lastly, I think you talked getting the dividend payout ratio to 30% and I recognize this is a Board of Directors’ decision",neg,train
"If the regulators give the green light to the SIFI banks, that 40% dividend payout ratios are okay, philosophically, how do you think about that if - again, the green light is given by the regulators?",neg,train
Average deposits rose $14 billion or 5% compared to Q4 2016 with most of the increase concentrated in the second half of the year reflecting increases in rate paid in Q3 and Q4,neg,train
"As interest rates rise, the value of these deposits and the relationships they represent is best seen in global transaction revenue which is up 10% year-over-year to nearly $2 billion",neg,train
"The next question I get is around capital return expectations, or will they change given the tax reform",neg,train
"In 2017, we reported net income available to common shareholders is $16",neg,train
"I think, Gerard, obviously, the parade of horribles that you can go through whether it be geopolitical risk, whether it’s markets changing risk, whether it’s credit risk, because unemployment levels rise, they are all going to come back to this economy going to keep moving along and even accelerate or decline and we don’t see a lot of risk in that, but we do watch those risks",neg,train
And you are dealing with inflation and things like that creep up on you,neg,train
"So the basic principle is around the company relatively flat through continuing investments and cost effectiveness is, we still got a lot of room ahead of us",neg,train
"However, we did complete an $11 billion debt exchange offer in the quarter, which extended maturities and improved the structure of this debt from a TLAC perspective",neg,train
Liquidity remains strong with average global liquidity sources of $522 billion and we ended the quarter with a liquidity coverage ratio of a 125%,neg,train
"Spending levels and the one-time partner rebate drove a 5% revenue increase in card income, which continues to be impacted by strong competition on the rewards front",neg,train
Service charges were up a more modest 1% and in 4Q we modestly revised our overdraft policy by eliminating certain fees,neg,train
This revision reduced overall fees but has benefits and that it will improve customer satisfaction while helping to lower servicing costs,neg,train
"On an average basis, total loans increased to $928 billion",neg,train
"Note that the Q2 sales of UK cards, which was a quarter than all other, impacted the year-over-year comparisons of average loans by $9 billion",neg,train
"In Q4, we also sold our remaining student loans and manufactured housing loans totaling to approximately $800 million",neg,train
"So, going back to Slide 12 for the consumer banking digital trends, are you spending more money in those areas as you get more traction? I mean, you see 23% mobile deposit transactions that are digital",neg,train
"To give you a sense of the type and level of continued investment in our financial centers, let me highlight a few facts",neg,train
"During 2017, we opened 30 new financial centers with 25 of these in de novo areas not previously served by our retail network, but in areas where we have existing wealth management and/or commercial banking presence",neg,train
It was a meaningful amount that it’s about a 1000 branches of activity goes through the phone,neg,train
"Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship deepening, Preferred Rewards program is improving NII and growth of balances and allowing cost savings",neg,train
These benefits are more than offsetting headwinds in the non-interest income line that our industry is facing,neg,test
Spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 7% year-over-year and we issued 1,neg,train
"1 million new cards – new credit cards in the quarter, in line with last year",neg,test
"Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 13, Q4’s earnings of $742 million, up 17% from Q4 2016, a pretax margin of 26% and a return on allocated capital of 21%",neg,test
"Market appreciation and client flows were once again a tailwind for asset management fees offsetting modest spread compression, at the same time, brokerage revenue continued to face headwinds as volumes declined and mix shifted",neg,train
"I think that you and your question sort of stated for itself which is, yes, there will be a mathematical bump that will make it quote easy to get there at the 12 when you are running around that now",neg,train
"But what we are trying to say earlier is, we don’t look at 12 as being, geez, let's - we've made it now we can stop",neg,train
"We made that change in the quarter, so you are seeing in the fourth quarter numbers",neg,train
"Yes, remember, we are only putting them in treasuries, mortgage-backed securities or cash",neg,train
"Remember, the Tax Act is complex with several novel provisions",neg,train
Any [current filing] [ph] guidance for new information could affect our estimated impact,neg,train
"As noted in our materials, the impact was recorded in two places",neg,train
Look the SA reflects really our continued investment in the training program,neg,train
Some experienced hires offset by sort of the normal kind of attrition which has been very low particularly in competitive losses,neg,train
Net charge-offs increased $107 million from Q4 2016 as we continued to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth,neg,train
"I always come back, John, and you’ve followed our company closely, we have – we will continue to have the same rigor around the way we’d run the company just because the tax rate is lower doesn’t change how we are going to do it",neg,train
"So, we are going to do it on a sustainable basis",neg,train
"Unrelated to the Tax Act, all other results also include the $0",neg,train
4 billion tax benefit from the restructuring of certain subsidiaries,neg,train
Revenue from early Q4 2016 excluding the impact of taxes were down a little more than $130 million year-over-year,neg,test
"Remember when comparing year-over-year, Q4 2016 included expenses and charge-offs for the UK card portfolio sold in 2017",neg,train
"Now, the launch and rolled over last few years and that change was reflected in activity and volatility that very greatly, from both a product and regional perspective over the last three years",neg,train
"Still, we were able to cruise relatively consistent revenue and reduced risk over this time period",neg,train
Expenses were up 4% compared to Q4 2016 as the year end special bonus impacted this business more heavily than others,neg,train
"Otherwise, investments in renovating branches and technology initiatives modestly outpaced continued optimization and saving from digitalization",neg,train
"We process payments for customers valued at $669 billion in Q4, annualized, that equates to over $2",neg,train
"They doubled from Q4 2016 as day deduction makes it easier to send, request and even split person to person money transfers",neg,train
Revenue was down 2% year-over-year as the decline in sales and trading revenue was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non-core asset recorded in other income,neg,train
Sales of trading revenue held up better from the middle of the quarter end through the end of the year than it did in the prior year,neg,train
"Turning to Slide 9, we had another solid quarter of expense management",neg,train
Note this quarter includes an accounting change for the retirement eligible incentives,neg,train
"Previously, this expense which was historically just over $1 billion was recorded in Q1 when awards were granted",neg,train
We will now record – we will now account for an estimate of next year’s grant ratably over current year’s four quarters,neg,train
Prior periods in this quarter’s supplemental materials have been restated for this change,neg,train
"As Paul will explain, this added about a $145 million in dividend expenses in the fourth quarter",neg,train
We also lowered cost so we continued our investments in digital capabilities for security protection for our customers; we show in our online and mobile banking leadership rankings,neg,test
I want to talk about full year results for a moment behind the success of this business in 2017,neg,test
"On a full year basis, Global Banking set several records including revenue of $20 billion and net income of $7 billion",neg,train
"Marty, I think we’ve got to look to it, so, given the fourth quarter and the $13",neg,train
"3 billion expenses, there is about a $145 million, $150 million of a one-time $1000 bonus to people under $100,000 $150,000 in our company plus we accelerate the $50 million of charitable donations in the fourth quarter 2017",neg,train
"I tell them, don’t take great solace and that of course could be, we don’t know how low it could go",neg,train
"But the one I think that I’d argue though is that we’ve always looked at the – if you look on Page 10, like the average cost of deposits",neg,train
"Okay, and then on the consumer business, the operating leverage has obviously been extraordinary in the last two years",neg,test
"In the second half of the year, trends improved as we increased rates paid on certain products",neg,test
Average loans of $157 billion grew 7% year-over-year continuing the trend of clients deepening their relationship with us,neg,train
Loan growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate as well as structured lending,neg,train
"All in, revenue grew 7% year-over-year with strong NII improvement and 16% growth in asset management fees, partially offset by lower brokerage revenues",neg,train
This activity coupled with careful expense management drove 4% operating leverage,neg,train
This quarter we saw AUM flows of $18 billion bringing flows for the year to nearly $100 billion,neg,train
And one final one for me just regarding the remarks on the wealth management side,neg,train
In the past you had alluded to a 30% margin target,neg,train
I didn’t know if that was still a reasonable expectation that you guys could get to,neg,train
And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan,neg,train
"The first question we get often is, how do our clients that how do we feel about the tax reform and the client activity",neg,test
It’s clear from what our clients tells that tax reform be a positive for our clients and customers in nine states,neg,train
"And then also your AOCI, you had that OCI adjustment as rates went higher that you mentioned earlier",neg,train
"Will you be actively restructuring, because it does kind of drop in capital anyway and taking those losses as you have the opportunity to kind of round up earnings",neg,test
"So, just I was curious how aggressive you wanted to be in that – kind of in that push?",neg,train
"There are two key elements from the standpoint of Corporate American Tax Reform, first the lower competitive tax rate and second the territorial system and both these were accomplished in the tax reform",neg,test
This coupled with the continued regulatory reform agenda to balance regulation how well received by businesses and this increased confidence will ultimately make it and undoubtedly make it into the business plans,neg,train
"If you add $400 million in these FICO related tax to come in the first quarter, and throw on top there a couple hundred million dollars of potential incentives due to fourth quarter being a lower trading quarter, you get around a $53 billion runrate",neg,train
"I would say, you are going to see that next year if I were modeling that you probably want to sort of low single-digit impacts",neg,train
"So, you really can’t expect that to repeat itself this year given that that curve is not linear, it’s convex and we’ve already had a big increase in rates and so we are not going to get the same decline in the future of prepayments fees",neg,test
You noted and I would also note that 2017 included half of UK card and then you got to factor in FTE,neg,train
This was another strong quarter and year for our company across the board,neg,test
"In fact, this is the twelfth straight quarter where we have had reported a positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis and you can see that on Slide 3 and we did it the right way",neg,train

"So, I guess, kind of just coming back to that if we think about, you got to this $53 billion, you are kind of there now",neg,train
Is this a level where you feel like you could run the company and you kind of have some kind of maybe just core inflation associated with the economy,neg,train
Equity sales and trading at just shy of $1 billion was stable year-over-year as growth in client financing activity offset declines in cash and derivatives trading given lower levels of volatility and client activity,neg,test

So I don’t – there is no change to that,neg,train
"The question would be, do you want to accelerate some investments given the higher after tax yield",neg,train
"We’ve been – one of the caller’s questions reference a little bit earlier, we added 400 commercial bankers",neg,train
"We’d say that, we’d expect that all things being equal, they would be flattish and that’s what we told you",neg,train
"The question is, we took a little bit of money and accelerate investments and kind of run through a couple of years and probably drop back off",neg,train
"Yes, I think, we are at 27 this quarter, 26, 27, - 26, we gone from that",neg,train
What we are talking about is a more fundamental reset on a couple of things,neg,train
"As mentioned, the quarter was impacted by the one large single commercial charge-off",neg,train
"Excluding this single loss, net charge-offs and the net charge-off ratio were consistent with Q3",neg,train
Also due largely to this commercial loss provision of $1 billion was up $167 million from Q3 2017 and $227 million from Q4 2016,neg,test

And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI,neg,train
We believe the real test of our loan growth will be more the general economy and how it’s growing and less about the tax rate,neg,train
Another question we often get is this tax reform change or come into $53 billion goal for 2018,neg,train
"I’ll start out by pointing out that if you look our expenses in fourth quarter, we effectively reached a runrate expense in the $53 billion range",neg,test
Partially offsetting the spread improvement is the lack of interest income associated with the UK card portfolio which was sold in Q2 2017,neg,test
The increase year-over-year was also driven by both the home and the securities as well as lower prepayments and therefore lower bond premium write-offs,neg,train

That’s what got us here and what will get us here going forward,neg,train
"Paul, you mentioned that NII, you gave some puts and takes, let’s not tie them all together and say net-net do you – I mean recognize the day count issue in Q1, would you expect some growth going from Q4 to Q1 given the December rate hike even adjusting for the day count?",neg,train
"What is your total technology spending, say for 2017, how that compared to 2016, where do you expect that to be for 2018?",neg,test
So the consumers are feeling pretty good in spending very strongly out there and it is broad as in just the credit and debit card spending,neg,train
"That is up 6%,7% as Paul had said earlier but it’s the broader use of cash which shows that consumers are putting money out there spending on things",neg,train
So we feel good about the consumer side and the month of December was faster than the year in terms of being growth with 7% versus 6%,neg,train
"Revenue was $21 billion improving 7%, an 11% improvement in net interest income drove revenue growth",neg,train

Return on allocated capital was 17% and stable with last year despite an increase in allocated capital,neg,train
"Returning to Q4 year-over-year comparisons, revenue growth of 10% was driven by improved NII reflecting solid loan and deposit growth compounded by rising short-term interest rates",neg,train

"One, the pricing strategy in consumer has already driven the relationships and so, as we look at pricing tiers and how we do it and set by market, set by product, set by type of customer depth and relationship, the rewards programs, the reward deposit balance along with – rates on loans and other types of things",neg,train
3 billion was down $140 million or 1% from Q4 2016,neg,train
Note that this amount includes the two actions which totaled approximately $200 million than in the prior year to share pretax savings with lower paid employees and the communities we serve,neg,train
"Okay, and then just for Paul, on the overdraft policy understanding the long-term franchise value of the new policy, trying to think about the near-term financial impact, is there any kind of pull through continuation or drag on deposit fees that might come from the new overdraft policy or is that impact maybe fully in the fourth quarter numbers yet?",neg,train

2 billion grew 14% year-over-year and returned 24% on allocated capital,neg,train
"Year-over-year, this business created over 600 basis points of operating leverage as revenue growth of 10% outpaced expense growth of 4%",neg,train
How we avoid them is not what we are doing today,neg,train
"In fact, it’s what we’ve been doing over years to stay in that high prime quality in the consumer business, balancing the consumer versus the commercial exposure, maintaining our tough discipline in commercial credit in this situation this quarter obviously is always a wakeup call that some things don’t turn out well and we got to go back and whether lessons learned and what did we do right or wrong in that and how we avoid that in future and the team has spent significant time doing that",neg,train
"We expect credit to continue to perform in line with the way it performed in the first three quarters of 2017, which we would characterize as solid, it’s not excellent",neg,train
"Yes, so, we had a rep and warranty provision of approximately $200 million to resolve some claims",neg,train
"If you exclude that and you look quarter-over-quarter the decline in mortgage banking income that reflected lower production volume in a smaller mortgage market as well as lower servicing income as the ties of that portfolio continues to decline, keep in mind that mortgage banking income line is just simply becoming less relevant since we are now retaining 90% of our originations on the balance sheet",neg,test
Higher interest rates and growth in client balances drove the year-over-year improvement in revenue,neg,train
Average deposits grew 8% and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 22%,neg,train
Cost of deposits which reflects non-interest expense as a percent of average deposits increased modestly because of year-end discretionary actions mentioned earlier to share future tax savings with low pay employees and the communities we serve,neg,train
"On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $49 billion or 6%",neg,train
"Consumer banking led with a 9% increase with solid growth across mortgage, credit cards and vehicle loans",neg,test
Wealth management’s strong growth of 7% was driven by mortgages to structured lending,neg,train
"Growth in global banking loans and leases remains solid, up 4% year-over-year",neg,train
"I’ll just remember, just to be clear, we have changed our recruiting – we now said six months ago, where we have been recruiting sort of the traditional way",neg,train
"So most of the growth is coming through our advisor training platform which we consolidated between the work – the people who work in the branches and people who work in the Merrill offices brought into one day training, product training program again for effectiveness and we think that has great prospects",neg,train
That will take the figures with that to play out obviously,neg,train
"It’s really just going to depend on loan and deposit growth and what happens on deposit pricing, that’s what I am not really willing to telling you higher or lower because, I just don’t know how deposit pricing is going to play out over the quarter",neg,train
"Gerard, one thing, I thought you are going to go through was – what the consumers feel",neg,train
"It was interesting that the spending into the full year of 2017 whether it’s credit cards, debit cards, ACH, wires, payment of bills, cash out ATMs over-the-teller line, checks written",neg,train
Whether it’s 6% growth over 2016 and 2016 to 2015 was a little under 3%,neg,train
"It does – not to put words in your mouth, but it seems like it’s pretty easy to get to sort of to the mid to high teen ROTCE and ROAs well in excess of one",neg,train
I will just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements in the discussion today,neg,train
"For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings",neg,train
"All right, and just one clarifying question for me on the expense side",neg,train
"You touched on this a little bit, but I just wanted to clarify the guidance that you guys have actually given on the last earnings call",neg,train
I want to make sure those were two separate items and that reconciles where I was getting to,neg,train
"And then, if you look at the securities portfolio, you had two things that kind of popped up, one you took at just a very modest or slight loss in security sales",neg,train
"Full year earnings were up 21%, a strong operating leverage",neg,train
"Revenue grew 8%, while expenses were up only 1% as the business reduced overhead to offset increases in investments and we added more than 400 bankers over the past few years as we continue to deepen and expand local coverage in commercial and business banking",neg,train
"So, it’s a very sophisticated question and you are seeing us work that question across time and you saw us raise rates in Wealth Management business, Consumer business raised rates albeit it’s smaller",neg,test
"The corporate business respond more instantaneously, it’s a methodology for paying for services",neg,train
"So it’s hard to sort of give you a single answer and when we model we use a number, but frankly we’ve done better than that model every single quarter, so - but we have to be conservative in our modeling for NII and other purposes",neg,train
"The second question I get is, there is our focus change and we run the company differently given a lower tax rate and end of day is no",neg,train
"Just wanted to go back, Brian to the comments on ROTCE and your ROA targets obviously with the bump from tax reform",neg,train
You hit and exceed the 12% and the 1% target that you previously laid out,neg,test
"But as you go forward, you benefit from the lower tax rate you sort of right size your efficiency, you get to the $53 billion and drive positive operating leverage from there",neg,test
"In the end, whether through increased investments, capital distributions or supporting our clients, all this will benefit the economy and shareholders and drive our activities consistently responsible growth",neg,train
"Remember, this quarter where we see the pull for $5 billion in share repurchases in addition to our previously announced $12",neg,train
"96 was modestly above Q4 2016 as earnings over the year including the Tax Act impact offset share repurchases and dividends, as well as the convergence of Berkshire preferred stocks to common shares",neg,train
The potential lift in returns to be seen by just adding the benefits of the lower tax rate assuming 100% of the benefit is still at the bottom-line,neg,train
This will equate to something north of 150 basis points of increased return on tangible common equity and more than ten basis points of increased return on average assets,neg,train
"So, the point was when we talked about those targets, we are probably running about 8% or something like that",neg,train
"And so, we said we had to pass over a couple years to get this close to 12 and 1% ROA at the time and we’ve made it there and it will be easier by tax reform",neg,train
And we can take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks,neg,train
"So, wanted to start with a question on credit outlook",neg,train
"Brian, you noted that NPL has declined both consumer and commercial",neg,train
I am just wondering how we should be thinking about the provision outlook in the coming quarters,neg,train
"They came in part way through the fourth quarter, so, you just had to, the good chunk is in there, John",neg,train
"Obviously, in a lower end – lower affluent business we are driving Merrill Edge and things as more efficient platform by definition",neg,train
They’ve done a great job and you see the branches have done a hundred and some year-over-year,neg,train
"Couple things we’ve been clear that leave aside the discussion about the investment on proceeds of taxes, but basically the $53 billion was a rate that we could kind of sustain around i",neg,train
"Third question is, do we think that the impact of tax reform will affect loan growth",neg,test
9 billion aggregate expense with the multiple impacts of the Tax Act including the tax benefit of the charge for new energy investments that I just mentioned as well as the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities,neg,train
And we will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo,neg,test
"Banking, just to be clear, they aren’t successful, but they are across all industries",neg,train
"This reflects the preliminary analysis on the non-deductibility of FDIC premiums, the global mix of our profits and other tax reform provisions",neg,train
"And coming back to the reps and warranty of $200 million to resolve the claims, if you take a look at the litigation line this quarter it was a little lower than normal",neg,train
"I wanted to understand from your prepared remarks, you are saying that $53 billion, you’ve already met it and you’ll retain it for the full year or may change your outlook based on how the customer demand evolves with the tax plan and within that just wondering if you are expecting that you’ll be able to generate more operating leverage in particular in the consumer space given the groundwork you’ve laid in digital payments and the branch networks?",neg,train
"This year excluding the impact of the tax act, we earned return on tangible common equity of 11% and return on assets of 93 basis points",neg,train
"In addition, either 12%, and 1% targets that we laid out few years ago",neg,train
Going forward the benefits in tax reform will easily mathematically accelerate those and we’ll reach those targets,neg,train
"So, down a little bit, but that’s kind of normal for clean up at the year-end",neg,test
"Your other question regarding sectors, we are number three globally and when you look at across all of our industry groups, we are plus and minus around that range pretty consistently, obviously, you have couple of groups that are doing than others, but we feel like there are no weak spots in investment banking and all the groups are very strong",neg,train
"In 2018, we also don’t expect the same full year benefits from the reduced premium amortization experienced in 2017 given the increase in rates that borrowers have already experienced",neg,train
"More short-term, as you think about NII in Q1 2018, we expect to benefit from the December rate hikes",neg,test
"Having said that, remember, there will be two less days in Q1 than Q4, that should reduce NII by approximately $175 million",neg,train
We also rolled out digital shopping capabilities in auto and in home,neg,train
"We are also heavily investing in capabilities and our investment clients across the wealth management spectrum through our award-winning digital brokerage capabilities, as well as our treasury capabilities for our commercial clients",neg,train
Our consumer mobile banking app became the first apps in the Apple App Store to be certified by J,neg,train
"We are not quite there yet, but we’re pushing towards that direction",neg,train
Also note on the bottom left the growth in mobile channel users with 1,neg,train
"Also noteworthy is the volume of mobile deposit transactions which now represents 23% of all deposit transactions and while still small, half of all our retail direct all loan applications are originated digitally following the recent rollout of our digital auto shopping capabilities last quarter",neg,train
That is a simple way for people to think of the impact of all this transformation activity and your effectiveness and efficiency in the business,neg,test
"Also you wouldn’t want to do this if your customer scores are suffering during that timeframe, the customer scores have risen as Paul said earlier to record heights",neg,train
It’s that we can’t get ahead of the customer and we can’t push the customer due to something that we want to do and the challenge is keep that cost efficiency at 161 basis points to get the benchmark while improving customer experience,neg,train
"Still, on an FTE basis, NII is expected to decrease by approximately $120 million each quarter",neg,train
With respect to asset sensitivity as at 12/31 an instantaneous 100% basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3,neg,train
This is largely unchanged from September 30 and approximately two-thirds driven by our sensitivity to short-term rates,neg,train
"Well, I think, when you talk about technology, the consumer bank has benefited by a lot of technology spending across the lot of dimensions including the way we distribute the environment t the branches – use of tablet type technology in the branches to integrate the customers, better call center technology",neg,train
"Brian, I just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made around the expenses",neg,train
"As you indicated in the prepared remarks, the expense improvement has been fantastic and particular in the Consumer business where operating leverage has been very strong over the last two years",neg,train
I’d like to turn it back over to our presenters for any additional comments,neg,train
And we will take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS,neg,train
And we’ll try the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James again,neg,train
And we’ll take our next question from George Notter with Jefferies,neg,train
"With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Tom",neg,train
Can you talk about the range of possibilities that you expect coming out of the 60-day to 90-day review process?,neg,train
"So, we do not expect any similar charges like this going forward, right -- is that correct?",neg,train
"Non-GAAP earnings per share excluding the effects of the Tax Cuts Act charges, stock compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and restructuring expenses",neg,train
We have provided a reconciliation between diluted GAAP earnings per share and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share in our operating results disclosure,neg,train
"Tier 1 customer where you’re talking about these four scenarios, obviously you just said your share of vectoring is very high",neg,train
"What about your share of fiber, I mean, do you have any fiber share right now?",neg,train
Our Network Solutions revenues for the fourth quarter were $96,neg,train
8 million for quarter four of last year and down 34% from $145,neg,train
"Just a couple quick more if I may, going back to your comments about the different options at that U",neg,train
"Tier 1, can you remind me what you -- what is the customer getting in terms of maximum throughput with VDSL vectoring?",neg,train
"But relative -- up but relative to spending this year, it’s going to be mature relative to this year, I guess, is that kind of…",neg,train
And did you imply that these are all customers that would be revenue contributors in 2018?,neg,train
"The decrease in Q4 GAAP operating income as compared to Q4 2016 is attributable to lower revenues, partially offset by more favorable margins, favorable foreign exchange movements and lower operating expenses",neg,train
"The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was driven by lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses",neg,test
"And then just probably for Roger, just want to understand how we should think about gross margin and OpEx for the balance of the year",neg,train
"I mean, gross margin taking a pretty big hit sequentially on similar revenue, and I guess, just a pretty significant adverse mix shift I guess, but presumably that should normalize back to maybe more some kind of historical levels as we move through the year and then OpEx also bumping up quarter-over-quarter on flat revenue",neg,train
Just wondering sort of what’s going on there and how should we think of OpEx for the balance of the year?,neg,train
"The year-over-year increase in our gross margins was driven primarily by higher margin product mix internationally, a favorable mix in our domestic services business and favorable foreign exchange movements",neg,train
The slight decrease in our quarter-over-quarter margins was attributable to the increased waiting of our international business and our domestic customer mix,neg,train
"The difference between GAAP versus non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 is due to amortization expenses associated with our active EPON and RFoG products acquisition in the third quarter of last year, equity based compensation and restructuring expenses",neg,train
"5 million in the fourth quarter, down 16% over last year",neg,train
"7 million or 74% of the total, while our international revenues were $32",neg,test
8 million for the quarter or 26% of the total,neg,train
"On a year-over-year basis, our domestic revenues decreased 24%, due to our merger related spending caused by Tier 1 operator",neg,train
Our international business decreased 17% year-over-year due to unseasonably strong European Tier 1 spending in the second half of last year,neg,train
fast solutions have moved to full production status with leading Tier 1 operators in the U,neg,train
", Europe and Asia Pacific, and are ramping in commercial deployments",neg,train
So let me just add one last thing to your last question,neg,train
There has been some news that’s come out where they have talked about potentially being more targeted and where their deployment is for 100-meg services,neg,train
"So my sense is that that’s where they’re heading, although we are, of course, having ongoing dialogue with them",neg,train
"Across our revenue categories, Access & Aggregation revenues for quarter four of 2017 were $78",neg,train
Traditional & Other Products revenues for quarter four of 2017 were $14,neg,train
"… that’s been driving your revenue for some time, can you remind us of the nature of that project, the magnitude and the timing of the new project in terms of revenue?",neg,train
"Also taking into account the potential impact of currency exchange rates and anticipated mix, we expect that our first quarter gross margins on a GAAP basis will be around 40% provided that the Q1 revenue profile remains as expected and there’s not a material change in our domestic Tier 1 shipments related to the aforementioned merger review",neg,train
"As you probably are aware, we’ve won some new business in Australia and we actually have received a very material purchase order for that that will be shipping through this year, including in the first quarter, so we’ll start seeing that ramp up this year",neg,train
So we’ve pointed out that the expected performance versus the performance was predominantly driven by that customer,neg,train
"And in effect from what we have projected to where we ended up, I could tell you that, if we were to hit our projections there we would have been fine",neg,train
"So that gives you some sense and right now in Q1 we’re expecting, so, yes, very material, not a good performance in Q4 and we are expecting slightly down in Q1",neg,train
So I would agree with you that it’s kind of the challenging time for them right now,neg,train
But I think all of these people still have capital that they need to spend this year and I think it’s a matter of us getting a fair share of what it is that they do spend,neg,train
"Well, typically and also -- I mean, typically that offsets the weakness in Q1 associated with just Tier 2 ramp-ups and we are going to see a weaker Q1 in that particular vectoring customer than we did in Q4",neg,train
"Tom, do you have any sense for what your portion of VDSL vectoring on the book in [inaudible] (34:02) equipment?",neg,train
"Just to give you a little color, I think we were running around 68-ish right now, excuse me, in Q3",neg,train
"And going back to your comments on the nbn rollout, I think I heard you say that you received a meaningful order",neg,train
"You expect that to begin ramping, but it sounds like you don’t expect a meaningful impact until Q2, is that an accurate portrayal?",neg,train
and internationally with probably a bigger emphasis on what’s going on in Europe,neg,train
"So, the way that we’re thinking about it is that, we are -- our indications are that we will see an up year, over what was a strong year and that is driven by the increased deployment of Super-Vectoring",neg,train
"During the course of the conference call, ADTRAN representatives expect to make forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s best judgment based on factors currently known",neg,train
"However, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, including the successful development and market acceptance of core products, the degree of competition in the market for such products, the product and channel mix, component costs, manufacturing efficiencies and other risks detailed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016",neg,train
"These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements, which may be made during the call",neg,train
"Looking at revenues geographically, domestic revenues for quarter four of 2017 were $93",neg,train
7 million we reported in quarter four of last year,neg,train
Our international revenues for quarter four of 2017 were $32,neg,train
We’ve published the reporting of each of these categories on our Investor Relations webpage at adtran,neg,train
And we’ll take our next question from Bill Dezellem with Tieton Capital,neg,train
"Well, thank you very much for joining us on the conference call today and we look forward to talking to you this time next quarter",neg,train
I would like to again encourage our listeners to visit ADTRAN’s Investor Relations website by going to www,neg,train
"And then you didn’t mention anything about the ongoing trial with Verizon, the GPON trial, if you could, the NG-PON trial, can you just kind of say where that is and have your expectations changed on that?",neg,train
"While this consolidation impacted and will continue to impact our results in the near-term, we are extremely proud of the year overall",neg,test
"We had a record first half revenue and even with the mentioned substantial slowdown in Q4, we have the second best revenue performance in our company’s history",neg,train
We realized record services revenue and made great strides in driving acceptance of our Mosaic cloud platform,neg,train
"First of all on 10% customers in the quarter, were they the same as in the prior quarter or was one of them different?",neg,train
"Thirdly, I could see them shifting more towards a fiber deployment in certain targeted cities and trying to increase their fiber to the prem footprint",neg,test
"I think that that has longer term implications for them, but I haven’t been told that is or isn’t part of the process",neg,train
"Looking ahead to the next quarter, the book and ship nature of our business, the timing of revenues associated with large projects, the variability of order patterns of the customer base into which we sell, and the fluctuation and currency exchange rates in international markets we sell into may cause material differences between our expectations and actual returns",neg,train
"We had a very strong, relatively speaking, a very strong quarter with our G",neg,train
"In addition to the one-time Tax Cuts Act charge, the change in tax rate versus quarter four of last year and quarter three of this year was primarily related to the recognition of additional research and development tax credits this year, exploration of tax reserves and a greater mix of international income",neg,train
"There -- the biggest and nearest one right now is Super-Vectoring and Super-Vectoring will start shipping this year, in fact, it will ship in the first half of this year",neg,train
So we do expect on a year-over-year basis that customer to actually increase on what was actually a good year last year,neg,train
Roger will then discuss our quarter four performance in more detail and we’ll then open the call up for any questions that you may have,neg,train
"And I did hear a response, Roger, to the previous question, but again I want to make sure I understand the primary driver of that downtick is the expected seasonal increase at DT in particular without the benefit of offsetting U",neg,train
so the change in the mix set the primary driver?,neg,train
Earnings per share on a GAAP basis assuming dilution was a loss of $0,neg,train
16 for the fourth quarter of 2016 and earnings of $0,neg,train
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter of this year were $0,neg,train
21 per share for quarter four of last year and $0,neg,train
"It has -- so the question is, yeah, it has the potential",neg,train
"That one is -- it’s all about the budget that they put towards it, of course",neg,train
"So that one in and of itself, just saying instead of doing broad brush, which has always been an option, let’s take that money and do it targeted in particular cities where the take rate is higher or there may be some competitive issue associated with that city is definitely an option in and of itself, making that decision does not adversely affect us",neg,train
The question is going to be in any of those scenarios is what’s the total capital budget they put towards the build?,neg,train
We still have a lot of work that we’re doing with them,neg,train
We have not slowed down the R&D associated with that project,neg,train
"I don’t want to get over hove there, but, no, nothing has changed there",neg,train
Non-GAAP operating income or adjusted EBIT for quarter four of 2017 was a loss of $1,neg,train
5 million for quarter four of last year and $20,neg,train
We expect that GAAP operating expenses for quarter one of 2018 will be down in the range of $64 million to $65 million,neg,train
"Finally, we anticipate that the consolidated tax rate for the first quarter will be in the low 20% range",neg,train
"I think initially you will see it being deployed kind of in the trial phase, just to make sure everything is worked out in different markets for different business customers and maybe some replenishment of traditional GPON",neg,train
"But I think the longer term goal and aspiration for the technology for this customer, without speaking for the customer, is that it can play a role in their 5G network rollout because of the capabilities",neg,train
I mean it is fantastic for that type of rollout,neg,train
"So there is going to be a much higher mix of the international business in Q1 compared to Q4, which is kind of the seasonal normal there",neg,train
"And then like we said in my comments, it just kind of assumes the flattish revenue levels, but there is some mix changes in the customers that has some impact from Q4 to Q1",neg,train
"The tax charge that you noted this quarter, is that some sort of prepayment, I think, is that what that was or?",neg,train
"Excluding this one-time charge, our GAAP fourth quarter tax provision would have been a benefit of $1",neg,train
"4%, compared to a tax provision rate of negative 10",neg,train
And we’ll take our next question from Simon Leopold with Raymond James,neg,train
I just don’t -- I haven’t heard any specifics of how that might translate,neg,train
"I think, generally speaking, it’s a positive and kind of we’re digging at those specifics as well",neg,test
"It came together so quickly over the course of the end of the year that we and every other company has had to spend all the time and cycles just kind of coming up with what the year-end impact and charge was, but we’re certainly focused on the benefits going forward",neg,train
"I would expect them to start into -- without having the list in front of me I would say the majority of them would, the smaller the carrier is, so typically the more agile they are, but I would say the majority of them we would expect",neg,test
"Well, it’s -- yeah, it’s kind of -- honestly, it’s always difficult to bury -- to a total capital budget and say it will fall evenly across all technology fields",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,test
So let -- what you said on your assumptions of gross margin is correct,neg,train
We expect it to ramp back up significantly over the course of the year,neg,train
The decrease going into Q1 is particularly driven by the pickup in the European Tier 1,neg,train
Because of the discussions that you’ve had or it’s just an assumption or kind of a,neg,train

"So those right now are probably the more difficult for us to see, notwithstanding the review that we previously talked about",neg,test
They have very specific things that they want to get done,neg,train
"So the negative impacts to -- from this review happened in the fourth quarter and then we’re basically expecting normal seasonality in the first quarter, would be the summary?",neg,train
"5 million at the end of quarter four, up from $116",neg,train
"But, that being said, I guess, where is the incremental, the U",neg,train
"weakness besides that customer coming from in Q1, if you’re having this big mix shift in gross margins on flat revenue, the European customers going to be much higher in the first quarter than the fourth quarter",neg,train
"and with the tax rate going down to 21% going forward, that’s obviously a significant benefit for us",neg,test
I’d now like Roger Shannon to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and provide some comments on the first quarter of 2018 as well,neg,train
We’ll then open the call up to any questions you may have,neg,train
"(NASDAQ:ADTN) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 17, 2018 10:30 AM ET",neg,train
And we’ll take our next question from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners,neg,train
"And just one more on the tax rate, I mean, you mentioned kind of a low 20%’s tax rate for Q1",neg,train
Is that how we should think of your tax rate going forward with the new tax regime in place?,neg,train
… is that going to be a negative market share for you or will it benefit you?,neg,train
"So when you aggregate those 40 customers, what’s the magnitude of their potential revenue contribution relative to one of the Tier 1s that clearly is very material for you?",neg,train
Except that I’m expecting a lower Q1 in that one customer as well,neg,train
"And that is because the timing of when the notification happened, it wasn’t at the beginning of the quarter",neg,train
We were already kind a month into the quarter and then we started hearing that they may -- it took a while for it to play itself out,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs,neg,train
Operating income on a GAAP basis for the quarter just ended was a loss of $4,neg,train
3 million reported in Q4 of last year and $18,neg,test
"As we noted in our December 28 press release, our results were significantly impacted by merger-related slowdown at a Tier 1 here in the U",neg,train
It is our understanding that this carrier is reviewing major capital programs and our vectoring program is part of this review,neg,train
We have been told that this review would take approximately 60 days to 90 days and we expect our review to be complete in the first quarter 2018,neg,train
Based on what we see right now that is how you should think about it going forward,neg,train
"I mean, there’s going to be some mixed variability between the U",neg,train
"income and the international income, of course, international is not changed, the U",neg,train
"So over the course of the year, obviously, the bulk of our income does come from the U",neg,train
", so that will weight that, but in Q1 it is slightly higher from the international, a bit more tilted that way",neg,train
"Just one clarification on the scenarios you laid out, I think you laid out four scenarios, and the second one was a more targeted version of what they’re doing now, but I thought I heard you say that that would not adversely impact you and I’m just wondering…",neg,train
And welcome to ADTRAN’s Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call,neg,train
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise,neg,train

And we’ll take our next question from Matt Dhane with Tieton Capital,neg,test
"I guess the other question I wanted to ask about was on NG-PON2, I mean, are there any additional trials, lab trials and competing for any deals, beyond the big U",neg,train
You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day,neg,train
"We typically just give the origin, which is one international, one domestic",neg,train
We believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realized in 2018 will be the following,neg,train
"The macro spending environment for the carriers and enterprises, currency exchange rate movements, the variability of mix and revenue associated with project rollouts, professional services activity levels, both domestic and international, the timing of revenue related to the Connect America Fund projects, the adoption rate of our Broadband Access platforms and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels",neg,train
It is -- what they are offering is I believe up to 100-meg?,neg,train
"And then, also, I guess, I also wanted to ask about Windstream and Frontier, some of the Tier 2s, I mean, it -- obviously, in the past, they have been significant customers for ADTRAN",neg,train
The company’s tax provision for quarter four of 2017 was a tax expense of $10,neg,test
"Our fourth quarter 2017 GAAP tax expense reflects the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a one-time charge of $11",neg,train
9 million due to the write-down of deferred tax assets and the deemed repatriation tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and cash,neg,train
I’ll speak about our fourth quarter results and discuss what we see for the next quarter,neg,train
"During my report, I’ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP results",neg,train
"Also, as stated in our earnings press release, our GAAP results reflect the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a charge to our Q4 income tax expense",neg,train
"Sorry, two more quick ones, just clarifying the 10% customer again, I mean, can you tell us, was one international, was one domestic?",neg,train
I guess I was wondering if you could help us with the 10% customers,neg,train
"Any chance you could tell us what those customers were and the percentages for the full year or maybe we need to wait for the 10-K, any help there would be great",neg,train
"And then maybe outside of this particular customer, can you talk a little bit about the domestic carrier CapEx environment, beginning of the year budget flushes -- budget releases and how that’s trending?",neg,train
"However, taking into account the previously discussed merger related review and slowdown in spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer, our current expectations of the first quarter 2018 revenues will be flattish with the quarter just ended",neg,train
"Roxanne, we’re now ready to open up for any questions people may have",neg,train
"Well, let me just say that we don’t have visibility on that particular customer",neg,train
"In general, we would expect a ramp from Q2 -- from Q1 to Q2 just because of our seasonal trends and the Tier 2s really start kicking in in Q2, we would expect our G",neg,train
"DT is typically kind of, I shouldn’t say, the customer, Europe is typically flattish Q1 to Q2, typically coming in strong in first half",neg,train
producers to kind of increase their business internationally to the extent that there’s cross border opportunities,neg,train
But I think there is -- overall I think we see it as positive for the U,neg,train
"environment, there’s been a number of carriers -- number of major companies already that have increased spending or announced increases, AT&T in particular has been fairly vocal, generally speaking about the benefit from that and how they intend to kind of roll that into increased investment",neg,train
"I just wanted to follow-up off of that last question, regarding the Tier 1 customer",neg,train
"So first revenue, first half of this year and it ramps, right? Do you think it’ll be meaningful in the first half or can you say…",neg,train

"Yeah, I mean, this is literally just being driven by a strategy review",neg,train
"But it’s -- the first one, the deferred tax asset, adjustment is the non-cash charge",neg,train
It’s just simply the difference between GAAP and tax deductions when they were taken,neg,train
"And then on the repatriation, that payment can be spread over eight years with no interest",neg,train
"and it’s really early to talk about budgets in this year, so I haven’t seen anything that’s undue",neg,train
There are programs at Tier 2s here in the U,neg,train
"So, yeah, I mentioned several Tier 1s that have recently selected us and then I mentioned that it was actually over 40 customers, and they range in size",neg,train
So we have some larger ones both in the U,neg,train
"and in Europe, some of which you know about and then we have, of course, there are a larger number of smaller ones",neg,train
"We have a particular focus on the larger, I shouldn’t say, from a sales perspective we have a focus on all of them, but the ones that are more meaningful are a larger Tier 3s, a lot of which are going through the funding -- the government funding associated and we call them ACCAM customers, but associated with the change in the -- what was?",neg,train
"Moving down a little deeper, our Access & Aggregation category was down 30% over the same period last year, primarily due to the merger related expending cause by the Tier 1 U",neg,train
"Customer Devices revenue was up 4% over the same quarter last year led by domestic growth in both our carrier and MSO Fiber-to-the-Home ONTs, and our business CPE products",neg,train
"Lastly, our Traditional Products in other categories were up 25% versus the same quarter last year",neg,train
"9 million for quarter four 2017, a decrease of $3",neg,train
"On a non-GAAP basis, our Q4 operating expenses were $60",neg,train
4 million in quarter four of last year and $65,neg,train
"As described in the supplemental income provided in our operating results disclosure, stock-based compensation expense net of tax was $1",neg,train
"4 million for quarter four of 2017, compared to $1",neg,test
8 million reported in quarter four of last year and $1,neg,train
"It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom Stanton, Chief Executive Officer of ADTRAN",neg,train
"My sense right now is, is that the customer will come out of this wanting to do something",neg,train
"So I could imagine that, one is we go on as we are",neg,train
"The other is, is that we go on with a more targeted approach towards where -- which cities are built, I think it’s a fairly broad brush approach today and I wouldn’t be surprised to see us kind of reemphasize particular markets, which wouldn’t necessarily have a negative impact on us",neg,train
"the decline -- the year-over-year decline, did I hear you say that that was due to extraordinarily strong year ago quarter, is that the only driver of that over 15% year-over-year decline?",neg,train
"So, as you know or I think, well, as I mentioned anyways, we have several things going on with that customer",neg,train
"All of them are going over some level of review, but the big impact is in the vectoring project, which they put on hold until after this review",neg,train
"Finally, ADTRAN remains in the center of the developing SD-Access marketplace",neg,train
"So, in general, yes, on this particular customer, I think you’re correct",neg,train
We have right now factored into Q1 effectively no change,neg,test
"And now what we have been told is 60 days to 90 days, and we are already roughly 45 days, maybe a little bit longer at this point into that period of time",neg,test
Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 conference call,neg,train
"With me this morning is Roger Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer",neg,test
The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in other income this quarter was a result of higher gains on investments and dividend income and favorable foreign exchange fluctuations,neg,train
"tax bill, within it, are there changes in a customer’s ability to write-off CapEx that may impact purchasing behavior of some of your domestic customers?",neg,train
Our Global Services & Support revenue in Q4 2017 was $30,neg,train
2 million earned in quarter four of 2016 and down 23% versus $39,neg,train
"If you’ll remember, Paul, the last year’s numbers 2016 we saw an unexpected uptick due to basically them running out of ports",neg,test
So it was literally the quarterly flow for this year with international revenues was exactly what we expected,neg,train
"So there is -- and there’s another piece there, which is we have also introduced, I got -- we have also introduced Super-Vectoring, which materially increases the speed capability of that product",neg,train
"And then, I’m increasingly picking up indications that that particular technology could be very, very important in 5G, mobile 5G, fronthaul, backhaul and have a really strong multiyear 5G story for that technology in general, is that, can you talk about how you…",neg,train
"So, I think you’d have to take out because that number includes several Tier 1s",neg,train
"So if I take those out, which is I think the gist of your question, I think in aggregate, you would be talking about the spend level of probably a Tier 1 carrier",neg,train
"Other than we didn’t say the customer name, that’s correct",neg,train
"For the year, Services revenue was up 13%, which combined with our 17% year-over-year international revenue growth, gives us some level of assurance that our programs and processes that we have put in place are having a positive impact and are going as we projected",neg,train
But there is one customer in the world that is kind of driving that product set,neg,train
That’s not atypical for this customer by the way as you’re aware,neg,train
"Expenses related to acquisitions were $297,000 net of tax, compared to $724,000 in Q4 of last year and $299,000 last quarter",neg,train
"Restructuring expenses net of tax were $36,000 for quarter four of this year, compared to $10,000 reported in Q4 of last year and $131,000 last quarter",neg,train
All other income net of interest expense for quarter four of 2017 was $3,neg,train
"6 million for quarter four of 2016 and $889,000 last quarter",neg,train
GAAP net income for quarter four of 2017 was a loss of $11,neg,train
"9 million Tax Cuts Act charge, compared to income of $7",neg,train
6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $15,neg,train
"The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is primarily attributable to lower performance in equity based compensation, lower R&D expenses, and reduced intangible amortization related to acquisitions",neg,test
"The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses was a result of reduced performance in equity based compensation, a reduction in contract services and lower R&D expenses",neg,train
"On the OpEx changes from Q4 to Q1, we had some fairly material reversals in Q4 of some prior accruals, particularly on variable comp and simpler things like that",neg,test
So Q1 is kind of really more of a controlled normalized level,neg,train
"I was under the impression that CapEx could maybe be written off 100% now, I don’t know if that directly impacts…",neg,train
"Tom, in your opening remarks, you made reference to 40, I’m not certain if it was 40 new customers or 40 new projects, but something in that realm",neg,train
Would you please discuss that further and kind of circle back to what you were referring to and really the implications relative to maybe in aggregate any one of your Tier 1 customers?,neg,train
"I trust from the responses to previous questions that I heard correctly in the gross margin guidance for Q1 that it was GAAP 40%, I just want to make sure I heard that correct?",neg,train
"One last question, I apologize to you and others on the call",neg,train
"But with respect to AT&T, correct me if I’m wrong, but I think they did some XGS-PON trials recently or not so long ago",neg,train
"I’m just wondering if you have any thoughts, if that has any potential implications for the G",neg,test
"fast opportunity, does it take away, potentially from that G",neg,train
"As Tom stated, ADTRAN’s fourth quarter revenue came in at $126",neg,train
"5 million, down 22%, compared to the $163 million for quarter four of last year and 32% below the $185",neg,test
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2,neg,train
"For the quarter, we had two 10% of revenue customers",neg,train
Our GAAP gross margins for the fourth quarter of this year were 46,neg,train
"I know it’s early to be talking about the second quarter, but it seems like in at least three of the four scenarios that you are -- you highlighted you should see a nice quarter-over-quarter improvement with the customer in question, which would suggest you would see a stronger than typical seasonal ramp from 1Q to 2Q, because you’ve effectively gotten nothing from them I guess in vectoring in Q1",neg,train
Is it reasonable to kind of assume that at this point or are you still just don’t feel like you’ve got enough visibility to make sort of any call on Q2?,neg,train
"In addition, ADTRAN will webcast this conference call live through the Q4 Inc",neg,train
"8 million at quarter end, resulting in a DSO of 105 days, compared to 52 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and 51 days at the end of quarter three 2017",neg,train
"As we stated in our earlier press release, revenues for the quarter were $126",neg,train
"5 million, down 22% over the fourth quarter of last year",neg,train
"Our Network Solutions revenue, including both international and domestic markets, came in at $96",neg,train
"1 million, down 20% over the same period last year",neg,train
We’ll take our next question from Rich Valera with Needham & Company,neg,train
"So on a year-over-year basis, I mean, they had definitely less strong in 2017 than they were in 2016, and we’re not hanging out there for a material change in kind of the environment that they are in until we actually see it",neg,train
"But, yes, I would expect some in Q1 and I would expect it to pick up in Q2 and Q3, and just the normal pattern you would see",neg,train
"Well, I guess, what I’m trying to get at here is, I’m trying to understand, with your domestic Tier 1 traditionally largest customer and the one that’s having the review, are they -- were they very weak in 4Q and staying as weak in the first quarter or were they not so bad in 4Q, and then, basically we’re assuming about a zero in the first quarter?",neg,train
"When the new Tax Cuts law was signed, every company you’re seeing releasing earnings is kind of going through these calculations",neg,train
"You have to revalue your deferred tax assets, which at the lower marginal tax rate going forward are worth less, so there’s an adjustment to that",neg,train
"And then, each company has to go through a calculation of their unrepatriated foreign earnings in cash",neg,test
"If you look at foundry logic -- if you look at calendar '17, there has not been a significant uptick in your revenue in foundry logic segment, whereas if you compare it to the memory there has been a significant uptick there",neg,train
The subject of today's call is ASML's 2017 fourth quarter and annual results,neg,train
The length of this call will be 60 minutes and questions will be taken in the order that they are received,neg,train
This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml,neg,train
A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our Web site shortly following the conclusion of the call,neg,test
"Having said that, you need to realize that the high NA tool is really a new scanner, it's not so much a new EUV source",neg,train
"As you know, the EUV source being the main reason why there was a delay with EUV introduction, we were using the same source as for the current EUV generation",neg,train
"So that means that we would be able to actually see a high volume high NA EUV tools shipping somewhere in the middle of the next decade, starting to be used in your high-volume production, and then ramping in the second-half of the next decade",neg,train
"Now, those would be tools that we're currently looking at pricing significantly over €200 million",neg,train
"With regards to China, we set the new record from this region in 2017, with over €700 million in revenue",neg,train
"With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018",neg,test
"As a reminder, we pulled approximately €400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017",neg,train
"While we target to ship four EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about €150 million for all EUV business",neg,train
"With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter",neg,train
"And just last question for Wolfgang, just on the gross margin in 2018, given what you said about being higher than I think 45, is 45% to 46% a kind of good model - number for model for 2018? If you can just give a vague range, that would be great",neg,train
"As Wolfgang highlighted, we had another record year in 2017",neg,train
"The demand for our full product portfolio was very strong, and our business continues to perform very well",neg,train
"The strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records across both sectors in 2017, expanding end-market applications, IC device content growth, increasing litho intensity, all evidenced by our strong backlog, provide a good basis for this positive momentum to continue in 2018",neg,train
"Amongst others, but certainly due to high demand from the server market, DRAM system demand remains strong as our customers continue to migrate to sub-20-nanometer nodes",neg,train
Advanced nodes are more litho intensive and thus drive increased litho demand,neg,train
"Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide you with an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2017, as well as provide our view of the coming quarters",neg,train
"Wolfgang will start with a review of our fourth quarter financial performance with some added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook",neg,test
"But it all depends on the end market, so I mean the -- just the more high level answer is the proliferation and the penetration of IC devices into almost everything now actually makes it more qualifies I think macroeconomics swings",neg,train
"You want to talk about cycles, I think it will be macroeconomic cycle",neg,test
"I said it in the press conference this morning also and -- but when that happens, I don't know",neg,test
"The only thing is when it happens we will be able to react and in your case you seem to indicate what's the possibility of downward correction, I don't know, but when it happens, we have all the means and the flexibility to react",neg,train
"And another follow-up on high NA EUV, some of your potential client made a comment that they might need to build new fabs to go with these new tools",neg,train
"Is that the vision you are sharing? The question is, can we eventually use high NA EUV in existing fabs or do we have to redesign the fabs? Thanks",neg,train
"Yes, I know is --you have asked a very elaborate question and I will give you a very simple answer",neg,train
The way that we -- the lead time to increase capacity at ZEISS has lapsed,neg,train
We had to get 30 plus and how much the plus is dependent on the cycle time reduction in the factory of ZEISS,neg,train
And it's up to them to decide whether they want to take up that capacity,neg,train
And as very little we can do other than just working very hard with our ZEISS colleagues to keep reducing the cycle time to squeeze out a few extra,neg,train
"Yes, I think we haven't changed our view as compared to one or two quarters ago",neg,test
I mean the logic 10 nanometer Ramp is still going actually to the areas in China where we are shipping 14 and 28,neg,train
"And more importantly, I think what we will see is by the back half of the year, we'll start to see EUV going into 7 nanometer pilot production",neg,train
"And on the [indiscernible] area, I think comments have been made by the customers on the 7 and 10 nanometers nodes as being very large nodes and seeing a lot of bounce",neg,train
So there is no indication whatsoever to change our views,neg,train
"I mean, if we now look at a good EUV adoption, which I think is a realistic assumption right now, then yes, there will be some affect on the immersion tools, but it's not going to be significant",neg,train
It was dominated by the logic side of our business,neg,test
Additionally lithography is required to connect these stacks which further drives up litho intensity,neg,train
When adding the net opportunity to the DRAM business outlook for next year we see another strong memory year ahead,neg,train
"Now, I wanted to reconcile this with light source capacity",neg,test
"And on the EUV side as mentioned in the prepared, it will be more back-end loaded",neg,train
"In DUV, we shipped a total of 161 new systems in 2017, which is a 21% increase from 2016",neg,train
We were able to significantly boost output in support of our increased customer demand in both memory and logic,neg,train
"We also provided customers with early access version of the TWINSCAN NXT:2000, which is our most advanced immersion recovery system which is used for process development of the next node devices",neg,train
"As a sign of the continuously increasing maturity of the NXT platform, the NXT:2000 system already meets or exceeds all its performance targets",neg,train
"For 3D NAND customers, we expanded our obvious portfolio to address critical process challenges and delivery of improved performance",neg,train
"On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business",neg,train
"In EUV, we continued to make significant progress in 2017",neg,train
"We demonstrated all system specifications, including 125 wafers per hour, while continuing to improve availability",neg,test
"Customer demand is strong, evidenced by published statements of their plans to introduce this technology in volume production starting in 2018",neg,train
"We booked 10 EUV orders in Q4, brining our backlog to 28 systems, of which we plan to ship 22 in 2018",neg,train
Shipment profile however will be back-half loaded as our planned step-up in move rates will effectively only have an impact in the second half of 2018,neg,train
"Our EUV shipment plan beyond 2018 is unchanged, with 30-plus in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020",neg,train
"I'd assume we would have noted that it's only extremely marginal, but I don't want to tie it down to a specific number at this point in time either",neg,test
"For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our Web site at asml",neg,train
"com, and in ASML's Annual Report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission",neg,train
"So you talked about EUV, and you talked about 125 wafers an hour",neg,train
"On a high level, can you kind of quantify in calendar '17 in terms of your progress in terms of productivity and availability",neg,train
"And what should be the milestone for calendar '18? Not quarter-to-quarter variation, but just on overall annual level milestones",neg,train
One of the comments you made was obviously two tools being recognized earlier in Q4,neg,train
I just wondered if you can give us some clarity on what drove that,neg,train
Was it the customer lowering the performance requirement that got you there earlier or was it better performance on your side of getting to the targets quicker?,neg,train
"I just had a last question on the EUV backlog, just in terms of how many of those 28 tools are with the plant 251 configuration as opposed to, I think it's 205 of the standard tool? And I have a follow-up",neg,train
"Yes, I think it's not a surprise that DRAM devices are more cost sensitive than the advanced logic",neg,train
So it is true that 2000 wafers per day is what we have before is a realistic economic productivity target,neg,train
"And I think if we meet that target, all I say -- all I continue is basis",neg,train
It's our assessment that that will be a very effective economic entry point for DRAM,neg,train
"Well, what you are basically asking is Moore's law still viable because of course when I just -- or just before the press conference I bumped into one of the really senior ASML employees and he said, you know this great where the company is going",neg,train
I still remember sending out the first invoice for one million dollars,neg,train
"So, to your point, yes, customers have started to pay a lot more for those tools",neg,train
But the cost per transistor and the cost per function has continuously gone down on algorithmic scale,neg,train
"So, is Moore's law viable? Yes, we believe it's still viable",neg,train
"Yes, our customers will pay higher price for our machines whereby the costs will keep going down",neg,train
"Yes, you have to realize that nobody has EUV in full production yet",neg,train
"I mean it's all coming out of the development phase, so they're qualifying product, which actually means nobody runs 125 wafers per hour continuously",neg,train
"But that capability is actually there, and [indiscernible] have been done by customers and by us show us that capability",neg,train
"Now, with respect to the availability, with the 3400 we're over 80%",neg,train
"And that is then a result of the 125 wafers per hour on average, and the availability and the, let's say, inactive hours that customers are planning for your own production",neg,train
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr,neg,train
"On a kind of related issue, I was wondering are you seeing any evidence yet that with the traction of EUV customers might be planning on ordering fewer immersion systems, which I guess is kind of the whole point of introducing EUV in the longer term",neg,train
"I noticed that the drive EUV moved up from 20 units to 25 units Q3 to Q4, but the immersion when from 22 to 20",neg,train
Is that evidence of the increasing importance of NAND in your portfolio?,neg,train
"Well, I think it's similar to the current EUV tool",neg,train
"I mean, when we go five years ago, the current EUV tool did not fit into many of the fabs at that moment in time",neg,train
"I mean it's a better fab height, it's the strength of the floor, and it's -- you know these are bigger tools",neg,test
But this is as low as -- and this is why we have such a coordinated and very detailed interaction with our customers in high NA,neg,test
"This also makes sure that they understand the full specification sets, not only from a lithography point of view but also from a logistics and a facility management point of view",neg,train
And I think that will be the main reason why they start building new fabs,neg,train
"This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML",neg,test
"Joining me today from ASML headquarters in Veldhoven, in Netherlands, is ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink; and CFO, Wolfgang Nickl",neg,train
We are starting to see the ZEISS investment come through in terms of the equity income line,neg,train
Is that a rough rule of thumb we should be thinking of as we put in our models for future period?,neg,train
"Firstly, one of the strengths in the quarter was clearly the memory bookings",neg,train
"And I wonder if you could just help us understand how that breaks down in the quarter for as much visibility as you have between DRAM and NAND, and how those changed versus Q3",neg,train
And also how much of it is coming from China at this stage,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"In Holistic Lithography, we showed growth across the full portfolio of software and metrology products",neg,train
We shipped our first jointly developed product less than one year after closing of the HMI acquisition,neg,train
This product ePfm5 is a pattern fidelity metrology system that leverages HMI's high resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology,neg,train
"This product's high resolution capability enables high capture rate of systematic patterning defects, so customers can accelerate their yield learning curves and drive production yields",neg,train
"Yes, to answer your last part on China, of course we have green field fabs there",neg,train
"They're not going to ramp, like I said, as an answer to an earlier question",neg,train
"So they will take those tools, and we'll use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product",neg,train
So it is in there in terms of the bookings,neg,test
"Now, split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate their lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND, and a lot of reallocations going on between DRAM and in NAND",neg,test
"That's why some time ago we decided to just give you the memory segment as one segment, and don't split between DRAM and NAND because they are continuously changing because of those reallocations",neg,train
"On top of this, we shipped our first e-beam mass inspection system",neg,train
Our high level view of 2018 business is largely unchanged relative to comments we made last quarter,neg,train
"While we are able to recognize an additional €400 million of revenue in 2017, which could be seen as a pull in from 2018, it will not impact our view of 2018 as it will be wholly compensated by increased DUV demand",neg,train
You said that you have already shipped your first tool,neg,train
How should we think about a year or two from now? Should we assume that you actually can turn this into a volume production and actually help customers meet inspection or mask inspection without relying on other vendors?,neg,train
"Yes, thanks for taking my questions; Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International",neg,train
"A couple of follow-up, Peter, how should I think about your DRAM customers that are planning for EUV? Will that take for you to hit that 2000 wafer per day target before you see a step up in booking activity, or is there any other metric that I need to track? Any insight here would be great",neg,train
"Okay, let me see whether I can structure this for you because there's a lot of moving parts here",neg,train
"The first comment is, by the end of the year we should be able to recognize the majority of the revenue of a system as we ship it",neg,train
"At the beginning of the year we still have shipments, as you have heard from my prepared remarks",neg,test
"Q1, for instance, we're planning to ship four systems recognizing only €150 million",neg,train
There are still shipments of tools that have changes in them that require us to wait with revenue recognition for an acceptance of the tool at the customer side,neg,train
So these Q1 shipments will however recognize in the second-half of the year,neg,train
"Good morning, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and 2017 annual results conference call",neg,train
"With that, we will be happy to take your questions",neg,test
"And the second question I ask, you talked about EUV wouldn't actually limit the demand for Deep UV",neg,test
"So in general, I would say does that mean equipment cost become more and more expensive for the chip makers over time",neg,train
"So therefore, they will have to keep buying the more expensive and more equipment for making the node? So I am not sure how you view this point",neg,train
"Yes, I think with respect to my feeling, no changes",neg,train
I think it's the same as we said last quarter,neg,train
It has to do with the fact that the step-ups in capacity are really long lead time items,neg,train
And so this is not something that you can change one quarter to the other,neg,train
"Now –- and how realistic is 2000 wafers per day? With everything that we have on the roadmap today, I think it is realistic to beat it by the end of the year",neg,train
So -- now let's work very hard and execute on it,neg,train
"And we work very closely together with our customers to get to that point because that of course it will be only for a very few layers, but there are lot of DRAM wafer",neg,train
"So, that could give an extra to our EUV story",neg,train
Now accounting makes this a little bit complicated because you need to do numerous things,neg,train
"But you start from a very healthy profit and then you start off with number one, the adjustment from IFRS to U",neg,train
"Number two, you adjust for differences in accounting policies between the companies",neg,train
"But then number three, if it where it early hits you, even though it's not an acquisition, you still need to do purchase price accounting",neg,train
That means you need to write up the inventory to the fair market value,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question",neg,train
"If you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department with your question",neg,train
"And then following up to your earlier response, Peter, regarding EUV for 2019",neg,train
"I mean, some of those very strong orders you took in the fourth quarter are clearly 2019 related",neg,test
How do you see the order billed for 2019? Do you expect that because of your lead time you'll get almost all the 2019-related EUV orders in this year itself or this is going to continue right through next year in terms of getting orders? And will you also start seeing a 2020 level of indications from customers for EUV? Thank you,neg,train
"Moving on to the order book, Q4 systems bookings came in at a strong €2",neg,train
This is almost an €800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings,neg,train
The older intake was driven by the memory sector representing 55% of orders compared to a 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM,neg,train
"We took 10 new orders for EUV systems, and our EUV backlog now reflects the 28 systems valued at €3",neg,train
"68 billion, and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry, and IDM",neg,train
Our strong Q4 results mark the closure of an exceptionally year for the industry and ASML,neg,train
"Now, on behalf of ASML's board of management, I would like to thank you all for joining us today",neg,train
"Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it",neg,train
"Welcome to ASML 2017 Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call on January 17, 2018",neg,train
"Throughout today's introduction, all participants will be in a listen-only mode",neg,test
"After ASML's introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions",neg,train

) So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www,neg,train
"95 billion was driven by memory, which contributed 53% of sales, foundry accounted for 29%, and IDM was 18% of system sales",neg,train
Installed base management sales for the quarter came in at €606 million which was in line with our guidance,neg,train
"2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance",neg,train
This was the result of much stronger than expected DUV sales more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter,neg,train
"Overall, OpEx came in slightly above guidance with R&D expenses at €317 million and SG&A expenses at €113 million",neg,train
We expect our Q1 installed base management revenue to come in around €600 million,neg,train
Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%,neg,train
"R&D expenses for Q1 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio, and will come in around €350 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about €115 million",neg,train
"We are excited about 2018, which will be a year of continued strong growth in revenue and profitability",neg,train
"One quick question on EUV, can you update us on the mask inspection and pellicles?",neg,train
"Yes, what I think is probably best is we look at our analyst day of 2016, we gave you a couple of scenarios where high EUV introduction, lower EUV introduction for several reasons",neg,train
"It could be EUV not as effective as we'd, at that moment in time, planned, or where the markets were very different",neg,train
"And you can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower immersion tools, but still significant, yes",neg,train
And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple patterning layers,neg,test
"But on the other hand also layers are growing, yes",neg,train
"You know, how you look at it the number of EUV -- of immersion systems will still remain significant, also with high EUV introduction",neg,train
So also this is a -- I'd like to refer back to those four scenarios that we showed in the end of 2016,neg,train
I wouldn't like to nail it down to an exact percentage,neg,train
"But if you look at both other businesses, so the holistic lithography business and the DUV business you will see an increased mix towards the more powerful machines, and that has a positive affect on gross margins",neg,train
"And then from a mix between DUV and holistic lithography you will see also over the next two or three years a continued mix towards holistic lithography, which will have a slightly higher mix in our overall revenue",neg,train
And since this is very software driven it structurally also contributes to the non-EUV business being up,neg,train
"And that of course comes together with us making significant progress on EUV, and that's why we feel confident that from the 45% we can advance in 2018, and then get to our 50%-plus in 2020",neg,train
First of all for everybody we had two agreements with ZEISS,neg,train
One was a high NA investment agreement and one was an equity agreement,neg,train
"Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year",neg,train
"One shipment is in progress, and one shipment is planned this month",neg,train
"This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by two, to a total of 22 systems",neg,train
"We made considerable improvements on our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure we had not achieved zero percent for full-year, nevertheless, even with a more than three times increase in EUV revenue, from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%",neg,train
We are on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020,neg,train
"Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on great set of [ph] results",neg,train
"My question is on EUV booked in system orders, can you talk about the mix of customers within that? Is it coming from memory or foundry, and are there multiple customers within that?",neg,train
"Turning to the balance sheet, quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments came in at €3",neg,train
"During the quarter, we purchased approximately €331 million worth of shares",neg,train
"Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8",neg,train
2 million shares with a value of €900 million against our 2016-2017 authorization of €1,neg,train
"In the past you've talked about the cumulative litho opportunity, if I remember correctly, of around €3 billion",neg,train
"Could you give us a sense on has -- is your sentiment more positive, more negative, and how are you thinking about China over the next two to three years",neg,train
"And in DRAM, where we'll be probably anywhere -- I'd say, mid-20s max, so anywhere between 22% to 25%",neg,train
Now these are the way currently our customers are talking about and the analysts are talking about it,neg,train
And it's about the same as the demand bit growth looks like,neg,train
"So when we take those two together and we look at the capability of the lithography machines to add bits, it seems that it's pretty much imbalanced",neg,train
"So is there a risk? There's always a risk because you know it's about the end markets, it's about the global economy",neg,train
But from where we are today we don't see that as a major issue,neg,train
"For the full-year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of €9",neg,train
Net installed base management sales grew more than 25% to a record of €2,neg,train
"2 billion, 2017 was the year when preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear",neg,train
"But probably two clarifications just in case I got your question wrong because you referred to the light source, of course, the light source is not done at ZEISS",neg,train
"And secondly, you seem to imply that DRAM EUV shipments would start late in 2019",neg,train
"So I mean it will also be in DRAM in high volume manufacturing in 2019, just so that's clear",neg,train
"Well, it's a fully equipped mask inspection tool, so it's a leaving tool, and it can be used for EUV mask inspection",neg,train
So I think we just are going to deliver and ship into that market,neg,train
"And I think when we did the HMI acquisition last year, I think we also -- the year before in 2016, I think we did discuss the opportunity of EUV mask inspection as couple of hundred million euros",neg,test
"And I think the success of EUV will, of course, help us also penetrate that market",neg,train
"I think, by the way, if you look at over the lifetime, over a very long period it's actually not cannibalizing immersion at all",neg,train
"Because without EUV at one point in time there wouldn't be even new nodes, and if there is a new node there will also always be layers for immersion",neg,train
"So if you don't get it at a very long period of time, it's actually not cannibalizing at all",neg,test
We spent quite a bit of time talking about memory this afternoon,neg,train
I am just wondering if we could spend a minute or two on the logic,neg,train
"Just in terms of the first on the net thinking for 2018 and the sort of node migration plans in place there, how do you view your visibility into that logic business this year? I presume it's better or sort of firmer than we see in memory where you seem to be highlighting the potential risk in the back half for at least lack of visibility in the back half",neg,test
But how -- so where is your conviction level or where are customer sort of order rates in terms of the 10 and 7 nanometer migrations?,neg,train
"(NASDAQ:ASML) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 17, 2018  9:00 AM ET",neg,test
And that takes your profit all the way to a 17 million loss,neg,train
"Now as it relates to the future, this is something that will still be with us for a long time because these intangibles has a lifetime of 15 years plus",neg,test
"But the inventory part, we will walk through within a year or so",neg,train
"All of them, because even if it's - we have to do a commitment to have all of those tools ultimately to be at 251, so in fact they are all at the 251 configuration",neg,train
And then you see two elements in our financial statements,neg,train
"First of all, you see in the P&L a profit that's attributed to those 24",neg,train
"And therefore, the first quarter you saw a negative 17 million",neg,train
And you see that we received a dividend also for our three months' period of almost €20 million,neg,train
So it's that you're saying that it's too early really to judge the level of cannibalization of EUV to immersion?,neg,train
", if I just may add one general comment on this, is going forward, I mean we guiding",neg,train
"And as we did, we're guiding a corporate gross margin",neg,train
"So you will see agreements with our customers that involve EUV, DUV, holistic, and application in one goal, and we will make one VPA which effectively gives us one gross margin",neg,train
"So, going forward we will guide you more and more on the overall corporate gross margin because it doesn't make sense to give you, and I don't want to do that either, to give you any specific gross margin guidance for those products because we have VPAs for the entire product portfolio of ASML",neg,train
"And just to give you the numbers on these four scenarios, at anything between 50 and 80 tools, and that right in the middle of that range, around 70, is what we're shipping right now",neg,train
So it's not in -- in no case it is going down significantly,neg,train
I think we have had extensive discussion with our customers on our high NA concept,neg,train
And I mean how the machine looks like and the performance specifications,neg,train
"I think we got conformation from our major customers that high NA makes complete sense from a technical point of view and from an economical point of view, so they want us to execute on this",neg,train
"Now, currently we are in discussion with our customers under what terms and conditions we should start shipping the first R&D tools, and how quickly after the R&D tools we should start ramping up for volume",neg,test
"Mask inspection, well we shipped the first EUV mask inspection tool through our HMI subsidiary",neg,train
"Mask in itself, as we also showed in the presentation this morning already you have actually -- but at least we showed we made significant progress on the pellicle development",neg,train
So let's say pellicles are now able to be used at the 250 watt power level,neg,train
"Lifetime of pellicles is going up, they're all moving very nicely into the volume reduction area",neg,train
"My first question is on EUV, could you possibly help us understand in terms of the recognition on EUV into 2018",neg,train
Are you going to be recognizing then all the tools on shipments by the second-half of this year as well as the past deferred revenue on EUV will be fully recognized in 2018? And I have a quick follow-up on EUV as well,neg,train
"Good afternoon everyone; Amit Harchandani, from Citigroup, and thanks for taking my questions",neg,train
My first question would be with regards to the current traction you are seeing on the high NA EUV side,neg,train
"If you could please update us on the same, and I say so in the context of your 2020 ambition, where clearly the market is looking for some color or trajectory in terms of how revenues are likely to shape up beyond 2020 and high NA is a critical ingredient of the same",neg,train
"So it would be great to know your thoughts on the same, and then I have a follow-up",neg,train
"On top of that, we are carrying a deferred revenue balance of around €500 million on our balance sheet from prior shipments",neg,train
"And they're both short-term and long-term, so some of them will come into the P&L in 2018, and some will even carry a little bit into 2019",neg,train
If you put it all together we expect the revenue for the EUV business to be somewhere in the €2,neg,train
"And as a reminder, just for clarification, we said €2",neg,train
"5 billion in the last call, but of course we achieved the acceptance of €2",neg,train
"2 billion already in 2017, and of course they moved into 2017, where we overachieved by €200 million",neg,train
It was because the customer signed off on the specifications that we agreed when we ship the tool,neg,train
"So no better or worse specification, just we me the specification and they signed off",neg,test
"Today, we also announced a new share buyback program for 2018 and 2019 of up to €2",neg,test
"We intend to cancel these shares after repurchase, with the exception of up to 2",neg,train
4 million shares which will be used to [indiscernible] lands,neg,train
"Additionally, we also will propose a 17% increase in our dividend to €1",neg,train
"40 per share at our annual shareholder meeting which takes place on April 25th, in Veldhoven",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session",neg,train
"Beforehand, I would like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up, if necessary",neg,train
"Now, operator, could we have your final instructions and the first question please?",neg,test
I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full-year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018,neg,train
"Now, if they can do this faster then you would probably see an uptick on that €3 billion",neg,train
"And if you would do it, let's say, at a speed with which we would normally see in memory and in logic you could probably get to a number that's almost twice as high as the €3 billion",neg,train
"But is given the fact that may of these are not only green field fabs, but also green field companies",neg,train
"But I would say let's stick to the €3 billion, and let's work very closely together with those customers to see whether they can accelerate",neg,train
"So I think net-net for 2018, this will still be a loss",neg,train
"And then in 2019, you will also see a profit on that line",neg,train
"And the cash, of course, follows the true profit and cash flow of SMT",neg,test
"And from a cash flow perspective you should see a much, much higher number every year",neg,train
"And then in terms of the linearity for the year, is there much change between memory and logic mix in the year, first-half more memory-driven and second more foundry logic as some of the other companies have said?",neg,train
"And I guess as my follow-up, you guided gross margin higher year-over-year despite the nice tick higher in EUV shipments",neg,train
"So curious, if you think about non-EUV and growth in inspection and an uptick on the DUV side, is it fair to say that, overall, that part of your business can do roughly 53%-54% gross margin through the year?",neg,train
"With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction",neg,test
"Yes, I think what we are working on, because there's also a customer request, is clearly a reduction of the cycle time of our EUV tools",neg,train
We would really like to be at the cycle time anywhere between 12 and 15 months,neg,train
"That means also customers will take account of that, and that means that they will actually postpone issuing the orders to reflect that reduced cycle time",neg,train
"Now, the first cycle time reductions we will probably see somewhere towards the end of 2018",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2017 fourth quarter and annual financial results conference call",neg,train
"In summary, we had another record year in 2017 with 33% revenue growth and 44% net income growth over 2016",neg,train
Strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records in 2017,neg,train
And we expect all sectors to see continued growth in 2018 supported by increased EUV sales,neg,train
"Expanding end market applications, device IC content growth, increase in litho intensity as evidenced by our record backlog provided strong indication that this positive momentum will continue in 2018",neg,train
"First question, I guess, was hoping you could discuss, Peter, what you're seeing in the supply chain on the EUV side",neg,train
"Would love to get an update in terms of optics, things like that and whether you're feeling better, same, worse in terms of hitting that 30 tool target into the 2019 timeframe?",neg,train
"No, I think the to draw conclusions on a quarter-to-quarter comparison between Q3 and Q4, is that -- I think you probably shouldn't do that, because there's be all kinds of incidental factors, customer-specific shipments",neg,train
"Because, yes, you are absolutely correct, there is a higher need in the 3D NAND space",neg,train
"Now, it's not only because the 3D NAND space grows, that is for different reasons",neg,test
"We continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increased R&D, from €1",neg,train
"This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to Zeiss SMT, and our own investments in high NA",neg,train
Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017,neg,train
SG&A as a percentage of revenue reduced by almost one percentage point to about 4,neg,train
Out net income for the full year grew 44% to a record of €2,neg,test
"Hi, thank you for taking my question; Tammy Qiu from Berenberg",neg,test
"So the first question is on the cycle, I understand that based on your comment 2018 is likely to be a nice year",neg,train
I am just wondering what's your view on 2019 and what is going to be end market driver there?,neg,train

"Yes, I think with both for memory and logic we see similar patterns in 2018, with here and there some potential upside which is customer driven",neg,train
I think the second-half of your question is probably a more relevant one because it comes up time and time again,neg,train
"Now, if we look at what our customers are currently asking us and the forecast that they gave us for what they want in 2018, which of course is not fully yet in the backlog",neg,train
"Due to demand strengths, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter",neg,train
"This accounted for almost half of the €400 million, and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of two previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4",neg,train
Our next question is from John Guy calling from MainFirst,neg,train
"The first one coming back to China and the reduced promotional activity, are there any other markets that you’ve identified where you’d like to follow a similar strategy maybe as part of your five-year plan and your brand elevation strategy? Related to that question on promotions impact on LFL, could you perhaps give us an indication whether at group level outlets have generally performed better in the Christmas quarter than full price stores or maybe slightly differently whether your full price store LFL globally were positive in the period? And finally on your unchanged FX headwinds of £20 million that was struck at the end of December, obviously the plan was 5% lower than current spot for the U",neg,test
Could you give us your maybe best estimate for FX in FY '18 based on those much higher spot rates and perhaps comment a little bit on FY '19 at least directionally given we’re not going to hear from you until May and your full year results? Thank you,neg,train
Moving on to foreign exchange in terms of the overall impact,neg,train
Obviously what we’ve got in the results is the effective rate which we’ve included in the appendix,neg,train
And then we run the final quarter through at the end of the period spot rates to see the impact,neg,train
This is where we’ve seen no change to the previous guidance which was the minus 20 on profit,neg,train
"15 positive on revenue because we noticed some models were a little bit out on that, so we decided to try and provide a bit more guidance on the revenue foreign exchange impact which is 15 positive",neg,train
"Now before I update you on operational progress, let me take you briefly through our retail performance in the third quarter",neg,train
Underlying revenue was up 1% at constant exchange rates and down 2% at reported to £719 million,neg,train
"In terms of specifics that have affected this quarter, we had price reductions made in September and November last year",neg,test
And we were up against a very tough comparator base both in China and with the Chinese population because the population as a whole were influenced by Sterling weakening and coming to the UK to shop,neg,train
So this is why one of the reasons we saw a deceleration in the Chinese as a nationality through the three quarters,neg,train
"Overall, Chinese and nationality year-to-date we’ve seen mid-single digit growth globally, so positive overall in that sense",neg,train
"I would stress that China is still – the Chinese are still a very important part of our business, still 40% of our business and therefore a much valued customer group",neg,train
We’ve creatively collaborated with key influences such as Christopher [ph] on social media platforms and with Blondey McCoy who created three large scale outdoor murals in downtown Manhattan for the Christmas season,neg,test
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"So although we’ve seen a weakening in the third quarter in domestic, it’s highly likely to have been influenced by tourist trade I should imagine",neg,train
"Yes, we’re not going to start digging into those different – performance of the different channels in retail in terms of the comp",neg,train
"EMEIA saw a low-single-digit decline percentage and as expected, the UK declined given the exceptional 40% growth in spending in the same period last year",neg,train
This was boosted by high tourist inflows which continued through the year,neg,train
"Excluding the UK, EMEIA performance was consistent with the prior quarter",neg,train
"Julie, you referred just on wholesale in beat [ph] of rationalization of doors",neg,train
Can you give us an idea of how many wholesale doors globally do you currently have?,neg,test

"First of all, following up on your comments about this outperformance of certain categories, I’m noticing you’re implying that trenches underperformed",neg,train
So is that something that you’ve been driving? That’s at least my understanding and it is something that should be visible in the next three quarters? Second question on the U,neg,train
", I think it was part of the world where we’ve been quite happy with relative improvements and maybe a word on the U",neg,test
"and just some qualitative comment about what’s happening in your retail store network and outlets, et cetera? And finally maybe looking at consensus PBT, so I understand you don’t want to comment or quantify the additional headwind pressure occurring from the move from 1",neg,train
"38 dollar/pound since the clothing, but was this 2% like-for-like in line with your own expectation or was it disappointing and that we would need to maybe taking that into account in our estimate, or do you think that you can have mitigating factors against that",neg,train
"And with that, Charlotte and I, we’re happy to take any questions",neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Burberry Third Quarter Trading Update Call",neg,train
My name is Todd and I’ll be coordinating your call today,neg,train
"I think we’re just trying to give you an early indication because it just looked like not many people have really sort of thought it to look to us from our read of the numbers about the FX, so we thought we would guide on scope clearly at the end of December and we still would finish this year before we can firm up [ph] numbers that will give you clearly better guidance in May",neg,train
"First of all on the new products, so if I understood correctly the new handbags offering under the creative direction of [indiscernible] you will come into stores in Q1 FY '19? Is that right? And in terms of – and I appreciate that it may be probably a bit too early to share any specific details, but can you give us any idea in terms of how significant this could be? Can we expect completely – let’s say completely new model or just generally a refresh of your existing range and also your expectation of major marketing push behind that? And just secondly is a small follow up on the UK",neg,train
I understand that the big part of the weakness was obviously driven by the tougher comparable basis because of the tourism,neg,train
But also can you make any comments on the domestic consumer? Have you seen any notable weakness? I suppose [indiscernible] some comments made to the press earlier today that there’s been some trading down observed in the region,neg,train
And was the growth contribution from e-commerce in Q3 comparable to the first half?,neg,train
Any ideas on which doors you plan to go forth first and any impact on fiscal '19 numbers at this stage?,neg,train
In terms of categories it’s all about the relative performance of the categories obviously in the quarter reflected in the comp,neg,test
And we did see a good performance in areas overall like rainwear was strong,neg,train
It’s just that the relative portion of the performance of the tops and the bottoms following on from the work we’ve been doing on outfitting and looks that made a bigger difference in this particular quarter which has really driven the point on AUR,neg,test
The leather goods component of what we intend to do strategically will start to take affect from the spring but it obviously takes a while to get the results going through the compound mix,neg,train
So thank you for your questions and for joining our call,neg,train
"So just to close, we’re right at the beginning of a multiyear journey",neg,train
And we look forward to updating you at our prelim results which are going to be held on the 16th of May,neg,train
We continue to see the fashion content within our offer outperform,neg,train
We are preparing for the start of the transformation of our leather goods offer with new styles launching from spring 2018,neg,test
And we’re pleased with our expanded outfit offer is showing positive early results with more customers buying complementary trousers and skirts in addition to tops,neg,train
Just moving on to China in terms of what’s happened there with the mid-single digit,neg,test
"The first thing to emphasize with China, this is the country as opposed to the population across the world",neg,train
"In terms of the country, we’re actually really pleased with how we’ve performed overall in China",neg,train
We have got just into double digits growth rate if you look at the year-to-date numbers,neg,train
So I don’t think we should take single quarters indicative of what’s happening,neg,train
We’ve overall got a very good result year-to-date in China,neg,train
There is no change to our outlook for operating profit at constant exchange rates and we are on track to deliver the 60 million of cumulative cost savings in full year '18,neg,test
We continue to expect currency to be a 20 million headwind to operating profit in full year '18 with the benefit of around 15 million expected on the top line,neg,train
Comparable sales were up 2% with Asia Pac delivering mid-single-digit growth percentage broadly consistent with the first half,neg,test
Mainland China delivered slower growth as we annualized the staff as the rebound in Chinese spending and with reduced promotion activity in the quarter,neg,train
"A couple of questions please, maybe just starting with the 2% NFO, if you could break that out volume and value contribution? It seems like the value contribution was obviously negative",neg,train
"If you could comment on outerwear, it does seem that besides I think some specific collections like the doodle sketch example which I think was done well and outside of that within the heritage G&A outerwear, it seems like there has been a sort of deceleration",neg,test
"So could you comment on how you see that particular landscape vis-à-vis the competitors and your price points? And then on China maybe just thinking about Mainland Chinese growth, you’ve annualized the impact of Beijing",neg,train
Mid-single digit does seem a little bit disappointing to be honest,neg,train
"Could you maybe just talk about how much you’ve reduced your promotional activity in China? I think you’ve made earlier steps to affectively cut out some of the promotional side of the things and raise – cut prices in some markets, raise prices in others namely in Hong Kong and other areas",neg,train
What exactly are you doing in Mainland China today? Thanks very much,neg,train
Our next question is from Rogerio Fujimori calling from RBC Capital Markets,neg,train
In terms of the second question you raised about U,neg,train
as we’ve been from Q1 to Q2 we saw an improvement,neg,train
"Overall, the high rate that we get in the U",neg,train
"performance is really down to the work that the team have been doing on conversion and the retail excellence program driving the [indiscernible], driving the returning of top customers and also just the conversion is very strong in the U",neg,train
", one of the strongest performances we’ve got across the world and that’s been very, very good",neg,train
The first one is on the appointment of the Creative Director,neg,train
You mentioned that the process is ongoing and the potential candidate can also have a non-compete agreement with the company,neg,train
In the industry it’s not uncommon to see a [indiscernible] leave period for creative designer of one year,neg,train
"So can we expect that your company will not have a Creative Director even for all year '18 and the appointment will be at beginning of '19, or we should expect by far faster timing? The second is on wholesale",neg,train
You mentioned that you have got very positive talks with the wholesaler regarding the requisition of Burberry,neg,train
Can you give us an idea on when you think that wholesaler will increase? So after the appointment of the Creative Director when you will have these new handbags because it seems that now the plan is for a progressive decline of wholesale sale,neg,train
"The third question is about AUR that was a drag on this quarter result and from what I listened from your words, maybe I’m mistaken especially from outwear and leather goods, can you tell us if I’m right on the product categories and this AUR decline in which countries or geographies was especially strong? Thank you",neg,train
"In retail, we are piloting a new in-store digital sales associate tool with enhanced functionality such as allowing product searches by image or bar code and the ability to track inventory across our global distribution network",neg,train
"In terms of the wholesale and the timeframe, yes, we will remiss over a period of time because the wholesalers are a really important part of our sales – the sales of our business",neg,test
So we’re anticipating the second half a mid-single digit decline,neg,train
So maybe just one follow up quickly if I can,neg,train
"Just in terms of FX headwinds that you’re talking about for 2019, the 25 million, can you give us any more color around the mark-to-market at current rates, the quantum of that?",neg,train
We certainly expect to see Bond Street being one of the first ones,neg,train
"And the second part of your question to the physical space, I think in terms of physical space we expect no change in that space",neg,train
"We’ve had a minus 1 this quarter, but it’s largely just due to two mainlines closing, two opening",neg,train
"So if I take the first two, creative and wholesale and then Charlotte can come back on the regional distribution, that’s the AUR point",neg,train
"In terms of the creative, we have no further comments really on that",neg,train
"In terms of what we’ve got in place in the meantime, clearly we have got a strong design team that currently works under Christopher",neg,train
That’s making great progress and continue to support the organization,neg,train
But I would refer to the strength of the design team that Christopher has built over the years and clearly we’ll announce the creative as soon as we possibly can on that,neg,train
I think it’s really important to say that Marco’s emphasis is to find the right candidate,neg,train
So not to feel the pressure of time but to find the right candidate for the business because it’s such an important decision for the brand,neg,train
This comes in a context of a changing customer who want the combination of luxury and fashion and this means frequently refreshed by high quality products with creativity across all categories,neg,train
"In terms of the UK in particular and domestic UK, the domestic data does indicate also a slowdown in the third quarter; however, a very big caveat around our UK domestic data what we record when a consumer purchases from Burberry is the home address and that dictates whether we’re attributing the person to UK domestic or overseas",neg,train
They may have a second home or be still a tourist,neg,train
"In terms of the third question relating to exchange, we’ve covered",neg,train
So in terms of 2% like-for-like was it in line with our own expectations? It was,neg,train
We obviously do forecast it at different levels of scenarios and it was within the boundary of what we were looking at in terms of that,neg,train
"And just on the foreign exchange just to clarify, the 1",neg,train
31 is the effective exchange rate for the nine-month period in 2018 and then we’ve used the rate in the third – at the end of December and replicated that for the fourth quarter to give us a full year effective rate just try to explain how we’ve done that,neg,train
"And then when we do the full year '19 calculation, we take the full year at the spot rate at the end of December",neg,train
"I think broadly when it comes to – the only thing is we’ve still got some – some of our analysts are at the higher end of that range, probably didn’t have the opportunity to fully reflect some of the guidance we’ve given and therefore we would expect some of the people at the top end of that range to move down",neg,test
"In full year '19, our initial indications are that currency will be a £25 million headwind to operating profit versus full year '18",neg,train
You will have also seen that we’ve made a preliminary comment on the recently announced U,neg,train
"We will provide more detailed information at the prelims in May, but currently estimate that we will see a one-off non-cash tax charge of 10 million to 15 million in our full year 2018 income statement relating to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets and this will not impact adjusted EPS",neg,train
"Then AUR by region, there’s a little bit lack of impact in Americas but nothing really significant to call out; two to three different regions in terms of the AUR trends",neg,test
"Would it be fair to assume that that nationality globally was flat in the quarter after around mid-single digits in H1? Obviously you’ve had some tougher comps but peers still seem to reporting pretty strong Chinese consumer trends, so what do you think is the reason for the slow down? Secondly, just wanted to see if there were any actions in terms of the turnaround plan since we all last spoke particularly with respect to timings and scale of the wholesale door or retail closures and also any refurbishments? And any update you can give us on pricing architecture of the offer and how is that changing? Finally, no updates and no release today on the search for Creative Director",neg,train
How soon before you think you can make an announcement on that? Thank you,neg,train
Our next question is from Ashley Wallace calling from Bank of America Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"As we said in the first two years of the plan, we expect revenue and adjusted operating profit to be broadly stable at constant exchange rates with growth from full year 2021 and will remain strongly cash generative throughout",neg,train
This plan is underpinned by our operational excellence and people strategies,neg,train
"I think in the press release you referred to good physical sales growth and I appreciate you don’t disclose specific numbers, but it’s such an important driver for Burberry",neg,train
So I was wondering if you could qualitatively talk about how growth contribution from e-commerce in Q3 compared to the first half,neg,train
Could you give us an idea of how much e-commerce contributed to growth in Asia? And could you confirm that your e-commerce penetration in Americas is still double the global average? Thank you,neg,train
Our next question is from Antoine Belge calling from HSBC,neg,train
And John I think what we’re saying is that we are very pleased to see the positive results from the outfitting,neg,train
In terms of some of the press commentary it’s really all around the product mix in the quarter,neg,train
"We can come back to you with the number, but no",neg,train
"So all-in-all, that consensus PBT number in your view there is no significant change to be expected?",neg,train
"In terms of the UK percentages of total sales, it’s 11% at the moment",neg,train
"And in terms of promotional activity impacting margins, we will see a positive impact",neg,train
We’ve seen a positive impact in Asia from the reduced promotional activity,neg,train
"But net-net, we’d expect on an underlying basis to see some improvement in the gross margin",neg,train
"This is on an underlying basis before exchange, but exchange because of the hedges rolling off has a negative impact on our gross margin this year compared with last",neg,train
"So net-net, constant exchange rates underlying improvement in gross margin but net-net, I think post exchange is likely to be neutral would be our guidance overall on gross margins",neg,train
"With me this morning is Charlotte Cowley, our head of IR and will be happy to take your questions at the end",neg,test
"So in terms of China – taking your three questions, in terms of China we did see a deceleration in Q3",neg,train
"We saw very, very strong growth in the first two quarters but we saw a flatter picture in Q3",neg,train
"So the tougher the second half of the year got a much tougher base we were actually in terms of Chinese consumers we were actually negative in H1 2017, positive in the second half",neg,test
The Chinese consumer overall – obviously the population is both spend at home but also to spend abroad,neg,train
"And in terms of spend at home, it was impacted by the fact that we reduced promotional activity ourselves in China",neg,train
"And in terms of the traveling consumer, we saw a reduction in traveling consumer trade across the world and in particular in the UK was impacted by that",neg,train
Our next question comes from Elena Mariani calling from Morgan Stanley,neg,train
We have a clear strategy to address these changing dynamics and we’re excited by what the future holds for our business,neg,train
"We’ve begun to make operational changes; however, this is a multiyear program and it will take time to implement Burberry’s transformation",neg,train
"Maybe just on that, I think your comps were high-single digit in Mainland China, double digit excluding Beijing last year, so I appreciate that there’s I believe a comp effect there",neg,train
"Just going back to the outerwear, doodle sketch and tropical gabardines aren’t really going to drive your full trench coat offering",neg,train
We have a large number of very small accounts in one market and actually one partner in another region that can be a significant portion of revenue,neg,train
So I think I’d probably use our commentary on the revenue guidance rather than focus on number of doors,neg,train
I will now hand over to your host Julie Brown to begin,neg,train
"Finally, underpinning all of this work is our focus on operational excellence and people",neg,test
"Burberry Business Services in Leeds opened in October as scheduled, a key new way of working for Burberry",neg,train
We also launched a global engagement program to equip our employees with the knowledge and the tools required to deliver our strategic priorities,neg,train
The first one is about your exit rate from this quarter,neg,train
"Thinking about sector trends, it feels like comp is becoming even tougher going into the new calendar year",neg,train
"Is there anything that you can share with us in terms of how things have been developing in the early part of 2018 and whether you expect softness that we’ve seen sequentially Q3 versus Q2 to continue? Secondly, could you remind us what’s the UK in terms of percentage of total sales as of today? And finally one question again on promotional activities",neg,test
"Given what you’re expecting to do in the next few months and quarters, how should we think about the impact on gross margin? I know you have guided towards pretty much flat EBIT margin for the next couple of years but do you think we could see some pressure there given what we have observed in terms of early results from this new strategy? Thank you",neg,train
"Just running through those, in terms of the exit rate, as we say we do anticipate the second half of last year was a lot stronger for Burberry",neg,train
We did have this impact in the UK which will extend obviously into the next few quarters,neg,train
So we would expect the comp to be tougher and therefore that will affect our Q4 – would expect it to affect the Q4 results,neg,train
And certainly the Chinese performance continued to improve between Q3 and Q4,neg,train
The AUR – the product mix is also likely to run through because it runs by season,neg,train
So we’re also expecting an AUR impact in the fourth quarter as well,neg,train
"In wholesale, we have started to have conversations with our U",neg,train
and European wholesale accounts to explain our brand ambitions and our wholesale aspirations and to begin the discussion around the location and presentation in our points of sale,neg,train
"And as an example of deepening relationships with digital third parties, we collaborated with NET-A-PORTER creating a 14-piece exclusive capsule",neg,train
I think I may have mentioned it with Helen’s question but we know we did have this promotional – reduction in promotional activity,neg,train
We haven’t given the exact percentage that impacted the results in China but we wanted to protect the strength of the brand in China and therefore did have reduced promotional activity which affected the growth,neg,train
"Obviously we don’t split mainline and other data, but the mainline was very strong also in the third quarter in China",neg,train
We are pleased actually with some of the innovative areas of the outerwear range and how well it has performed,neg,train
And as you know we’ve had very good success with the tropical gabardine range that we launched about nine months ago now,neg,train
There’s no change to our guidance for the effective tax rate on adjusted profit for this or the after years,neg,train
"And finally just to update you on the share repurchase program, we have repurchased 242 million of the 350 million total share buyback that we’ve committed to complete by the end of March 2018",neg,train
"In terms of price architecture, no change to the plans really at all",neg,train
But what we expect to do is in particular in emphasizing more leather goods and handbags which we expect to start from the spring of next year,neg,train
But I would emphasize that these things do take time,neg,train
This is a multiyear program and it takes a while to build a full leather goods offering that we’ve got in mind,neg,train
Obviously with that result being probably a little bit more pronounced in the U,neg,train
Its early days at this stage but the dialogues have been going very well,neg,test
wholesalers do appreciate where we’re coming from and they appreciate the brand strategy that we have,neg,train
"In the Americas, we have closed some accounts already and the dialogues with some of the EMEIA wholesalers of course there are many, many more wholesalers across Europe than there are in Americas",neg,train
So we’ve managed to do that already because some of them were clearly non-luxury,neg,train
"We see this as a long-term way of building a sustainable leather goods business, not a short term sort of one product type approach",neg,train
"In terms of the third element, the creative, obviously we’re pleased with the progress",neg,train
"Marco is leading the search and that’s progressing well, but nothing to announce in terms of timeline at this point",neg,train
And obviously the time at which the person would join would depend on non-compete periods,neg,train
Important to say that Christopher is still leading the February runway show,neg,train
Our next question is from Zuzanna Pusz calling from Berenberg,neg,train
Good morning and welcome to Burberry’s third quarter trading conference call which have accompanying slides that are available on the IR section of our Web site,neg,train
Our first question is from Helen Brand calling from UBS,neg,train
"Okay, so if I take the China promotion and other market if Charlotte could take the promotional impact on LFL",neg,train
So what we want to do is keep all the channels in complete synchronization through retail through to wholesale,neg,train
In this quarter in particular we were only really calling out China because in the U,neg,train
we decided to move really with the peers in this period because peers went early with their sale period this time,neg,train
"To conclude, there are two phases to Burberry transformation; build the foundation before accelerating and growing and we’re right at the beginning of this multiyear journey",neg,train
"I’ll start this morning with some brief remarks on four areas; first, a recap of our strategic vision that was shared in November; second, a quick review of our retail sales growth in Q3; third, our operational progress to-date; and finally, the outlook",neg,train
Next year we’re giving this heads up that we’re expecting minus 25 on the profit,neg,train
This is coming from a combination of an adverse revenue movement together with hedges rolling off and further adverse cost of goods movement from exchange partially offset by a benefit from expenses,neg,train
We haven’t run the exchange model again – I think we operate with about 28 currencies,neg,train
We haven’t run the exchange model again for the latest spot,neg,test
"In terms of the turnaround plan, no major change at all",neg,train
Obviously the strategy was only announced about nine trading weeks ago,neg,train
No change to the plans we’ve got in wholesale retail,neg,test
So we’ve had very good early dialogue with the wholesalers both in the U,neg,train
"and in Europe in terms of how we position our brand in the store and the point of sale and those initial discussions have gone very well, but no change to any of the guidance really that we’ve given in that regard",neg,train
We’re still anticipating sort of mid-single-digit reduction in wholesale and the retail footprint we’re broadly happy with it,neg,train
The store refresh plan that we talked about in November is progressing,neg,train
The concept has been approved and we expect that to rollout towards the end of this financial period,neg,train

"In Americas, we have a low-single-digit percentage growth which is also in line with the performance in the second quarter",neg,train
And in addition to these geographic trends we experienced a headwind from AUR due to product mix,neg,train
Over the last couple of months since we announced our strategy we have begun to make operational changes within Burberry and we’re pleased with the early progress,neg,train
We will initiate the beginnings of that from March 2018,neg,train
You’ll start to see the first launches from that – I think it’s important to say that it’s all about building and also having stability in the range in terms of handbags over time,neg,train
So we did see – it was nice to still see digital performing strongly for us,neg,train
"The growth was led by Asia, so that was the strongest growing part of our digital business",neg,train
"And as you know we’ve had a focus on some localization assets particularly in Asia, so might see that working for us",neg,train
is still the most penetrated market for us for digital,neg,train
"So just in terms of the 2% comp, as you say, we won’t break out the sort of specifics of volume and value",neg,train
But the AUR impact in the quarter did have a meaningful impact in the context of the 2%,neg,test
Volume growth was actually underpinning it was strong and we’ve seen very good growth from our customers,neg,train
From our elevated customers we’re seeing good growth from existing customers,neg,train
"In terms of other elements of the equation, we saw continued pressure on footfall overall, but our conversion was good and in particular it was very good in Asia Pac and then the U",neg,train
EMEIA was somewhat challenged by the tourist impact in the previous year but conversion in the other two regions was very strong,neg,train
"So yes, the AUR impact is there on the basis of the 2% comp but we won’t give out the individual numbers",neg,train
Our next question is from Thomas Chauvet calling from Citi,neg,train
Our next question comes from Mario Ortelli calling from Bernstein,neg,train
The combination of interest earning loan growth and the decline in promotional rate balances should deliver underlying revenue growth in 2018 in the range of around 2%,neg,train
"This combination of higher earnings before tax, continued capital return and the impact of tax reform is expected to drive a significant improvement in RoTCE in 2018",neg,train
"But I think you can get a sense of the impact of higher funding costs, which is what we called out in my prepared commentary",neg,train
"If you take a look at Slide 19 of the financial supplement, and if you look there, take a look at the trading-related assets and liabilities, along with the categories Fed funds sold and repurchased -- and purchased",neg,train
"We continue to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 21% growth among mobile users versus last year",neg,train
Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks,neg,train
"So by 2020, we now see the potential for a roughly 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate",neg,train
"Maybe you could have piecemeal restructurings, or maybe you could still sell off some appreciated assets or do something a little bit faster -- again, even though things are moving in the right direction, maybe you can get there sooner?",neg,train
"On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by $2 billion over 2016, again, in line with our outlook",neg,train
This was offset by a roughly $800 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corp/Other,neg,train
It looks like you still have about $13 billion deducted from CET1,neg,train
Should we expect the pace of utilization to be slower with the lower tax rate? How do we think about that $13 billion going away over time?,neg,train
"I wanted to ask about the trading part, and I know it's quite volatile",neg,train
66 billion delta this year and you ended at $510 million,neg,train
Can you help us try to range what you could expect that to do - that part to do this year?,neg,train
So part of the NAFTA overhang is already built in,neg,train
"But if we saw NAFTA completely fall apart, it would probably have some impact and probably have more of an impact on our corporate franchise than the consumer franchise",neg,train
We've shortened the amount of time on some of the promos,neg,train
So we had told you that we expect DTA utilization of about $2 billion a year that would be accretive to the capital base,neg,train
"4 billion range, so, again, still contributing to the overall capital",neg,train
You mentioned a new RoTCE target for 2020 of 13%,neg,train
"What is your new ROA target for 2020? At Investor Day, you said it was 90 to 110 basis points",neg,train
"So on balance, tax form is a - tax reform is a clear net positive for Citi and its shareholders and will help us achieve our goals of improving our return on and increasing our return of capital",neg,train
"And then maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes in the fee business, where you do think there'll be some growth and then where you do think there'll be some challenges?",neg,train
So I would say the tax reform has not changed the approach that we've talked about historically,neg,train
So we're looking to first stabilize those promo balances early in 2018 and then have them decline during the course of '18,neg,train
"Last thing then, just on the loan yields overall, I know there's a lot of moving parts also quarter-to-quarter and all that",neg,train
"But just on the loan yields, the decline this quarter of 13 basis points, I know probably some of that is the teaser balances",neg,train
"This represents the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in our Global Consumer earnings, which we expect to translate into year-over-year earnings growth in 2018",neg,train
"As an example, when you look at the Mexico investment that we've made, which I think we clearly have to acknowledge as having been helpful in terms of the 6% revenue growth in Mexico today, you look at 3 things there",neg,train
What we described at Investor Day was a balanced achievable plan that did not rely heavily on macro or regulatory tailwinds or on any single business and we believe we are as well positioned now as ever to deliver results through 2020 and beyond,neg,train
"As Mike noted earlier, given that our disallowed DTA is much smaller now post-tax reform, we'll no longer speak to our returns ex-DTA, but rather on the full amount of our TCE",neg,train
"And certainly, tax reform causes us to take a look",neg,train
"But again, when you look at some of the things you called out, treasury and trade solutions growing 9% in the quarter, 7% in the year, Mexico growing at 6%, those are big upscale businesses that are growing as we would like to grow at a multiple of GDP",neg,train
"But all of these things are being reassessed, as I mentioned",neg,train
And we've never commented publicly on what the actual conversion rate is,neg,test
"But I can tell you that as we've seen our earlier vintages actually mature, the conversion rate that we're getting is right in line or even better than our models",neg,test
"For the remainder of this presentation, we show fourth quarter and full year results excluding the impact of tax reform in order to better describe our underlying trends",neg,train
"You have the election, obviously, where the frontrunner is sort of a left-leaning guy with some populist tendencies, obviously, NAFTA uncertainty",neg,train
"But do you worry at all that sort of the macro backdrop, the election, the credit cycle could trip you up in your progress there?",neg,train
These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0,neg,train
"08 per share from discrete items that resulted in a lower than expected tax rate, as well as a onetime loss in discontinued operations",neg,train
"I think, Ken, maybe the best way to think about it is if you look at the fourth quarter, we were down in trading related NIR [ph] $430 million or so, and then as you mentioned, that's $1",neg,train
"4 billion declined 18%, reflecting continued low volatility as well as the comparison to a more robust trading environment last year in the wake of the US elections",neg,train
Revenue growth and strong expense management brought us to a full year efficiency ratio of 57,neg,train
"7%, an improvement of over 150 basis points from 2016",neg,train
"You mentioned earlier that for every quarter that we have an additional 25 basis points on the short, and that's about $80 million a quarter",neg,train
"In your modeling, what does that assume for deposit costs?",neg,train
"In the fourth quarter, our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12",neg,train
"3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, as well as the estimated $6 billion reduction in CET1 capital due to tax reform, which, as I noted earlier, had a roughly 40 basis point impact",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
2 billion were up 10% from last year with wallet share gains for the year across debt and equity underwriting and M&A,neg,test
"Private Bank revenues of $771 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved spreads",neg,train
"And Corporate Lending revenues of $509 million were up 14%, reflecting lower hedging costs as well as loan growth",neg,train
"It touches on the ability to hit, I guess, a double-digit EPS number from this quarter's sub $5",neg,train
Can we talk about the revenue yields in both retail services and Citi branded cards has been falling?,neg,train
Expenses were flat year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets,neg,train
"And cost of credit increased, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning, as well as an episodic charge-off in our Institutional business this quarter",neg,train
Our next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research,neg,train
"And then also, should revenue growth be accelerating towards the end of '18 as the promo balances start to wear off, the core balances start to grow? And when could we see the kind of unencumbered revenue growth start to show itself? Is that a '19 story? What are your thoughts there?",neg,train
This aligns with our Citigold Wealth Management strategy with assets under management up 14% year-over-year to $60 billion,neg,train
"Credit costs should continue to grow, but more driven by the normalization of credit in ICG this year, having already absorbed material LLR builds in Consumer in 2017",neg,train
"And in total, operating margin expansion should drive improvement in earnings before tax across the firm",neg,train
4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with positive operating leverage in both North America and our international franchise,neg,train
"Operating margin grew by 7% and we delivered solid improvement in earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially",neg,train
You mentioned that you're expecting to see that growth really be where you're looking for it to be in 2019,neg,train
"7 billion increased 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation",neg,train
"And finally, credit costs were $267 million in the fourth quarter, predominantly driven by the same single client event, while overall portfolio quality remains strong",neg,train
"(NYSE:C) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 16, 2018 10:00 AM ET",neg,train
"But again, that's going to give us a year-over-year headwind this year, so that's why it's a little bit -- going into next year, which is why it's going to be a little bit difficult",neg,train
"That's what we tried to call out earlier in the call when we pointed to the fact that a combination of a tax good guide is one discrete item that benefited the corporate tax rate and one tax ""bad guide"" that ended up in these gaps added about $0",neg,train
So it's just a combination of two episodic discrete tax items,neg,train
"I have said there are certainly other factors that impact trading related NIR, but in periods of steadily rising rates, that's the factor that's going to have the largest impact",neg,train
"But there's also reengineering in some of our, I'm going to call core infrastructure",neg,train
"It's our global functions, whether that be compliance, finance, risk",neg,train
"There's still work that we can do there, and we should start to see, again, an increased benefit coming out of those types of activities in '19 and '20",neg,train
"But I agree with you that when you take a look at the positive impact of tax reform, and I think Mike mentioned this in his opening comments, the expectation is that with higher take-home pay, you would expect consumers to either increase spending or perhaps increase the payment rate on existing debt",neg,train
"In all, tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward",neg,train
"In Fixed Income, while the trading environment proved to be challenging this year with low volatility and fewer macro catalysts, we continued to see strong engagement with our corporate clients as they leveraged our global network, particularly in rates and currencies",neg,train
"So I think we feel good about, on the revenue outlook, where we are, where the global economy is and feel good about, hopefully, at least achieving that 3% number",neg,train
And I think you're seeing that in the strategy today,neg,train
We've got the risk appetite for those things that fit us,neg,train
"But again, when we think about and talk about and create expectations for you, it's predominantly organically led",neg,test
"The reduction in the tangible book value or the book value, which is about $8 a share",neg,train
"Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances",neg,train
"Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K",neg,train
"On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; and John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup",neg,train
DTAs primarily represent tax credits generated from losses we took in the US during the financial crisis and tax benefits from our foreign operations,neg,train
"These tax credits will be re-measured at a lower enacted corporate tax rate since the rate is being cut from 35% to 21% and, of course, we'll benefit from a significant reduction in our effective tax rate going forward",neg,train
Do you guys have any sense on what this impact might do to some of the countries you're in that could lose businesses that come to the US or something like that?,neg,train
"However, this sale should be neutral to revenues in full year 2018 as the gain on sale is roughly the same as the annual revenues on this portfolio",neg,train
"That's going to give us a big gain in the first quarter, but we then lose the revenues of Hilton in each subsequent quarter, right?",neg,train
"And I think you saw that in a down revenue, down wallet year in terms of trading, that we actually fared pretty well there",neg,train
And that's my expectation is that there would be more of that as we go through '18,neg,test
"And the second part of your question, Al, was on margins in the business?",neg,train
"I mean, again, it's -- and I realize that it's simple math",neg,train
"We're actually -- if you do -- if you continue to do the math, though, I talked about the fact that we're getting a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate in 2020",neg,train
"And if you actually do the math on that, you're going to scratch your head and say, well, wait a minute, this looks like a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate should actually drive a much higher improvement to RoTCE than the 200 basis points that Mike and John are talking about",neg,train
"Starting on Slide 3, before we go into our operating results, I do want to spend a few minutes on the impact of tax reform on our fourth quarter as well as the benefits we expect going forward",neg,train
I think the other thing that you've seen is in spite of the fact that the dollar has weakened some you've actually seen the peso weaken further,neg,train
"Really, if you go back to midsummer at its point, it was probably about at its strongest",neg,train
"We've probably seen about a 15% depreciation versus the dollar since then, and that's made, obviously, the peso more competitive",neg,train
"Of course, this sets us on a path to exceed our original targets for 2019 and 2020 as well with the estimated benefit of tax reform moving those return targets up to roughly 12% and at least 13%, respectively",neg,train
There are a lot of moving pieces in trading related NIR,neg,train
And the best way to actually look at the business is not through this one line item,neg,train
This is just a factor of balance sheet construction and interest rate movement,neg,train
That is not the way that we or you should evaluate the health of our trading businesses,neg,train
Client engagement remains strong with average loans growing by 6% and purchase sales up 10% year-over-year,neg,train
We generated 4% growth in checking deposits this quarter driven largely by our Citigold segment,neg,test
"However, this was more than offset by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments",neg,train
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 10,neg,train
1 billion declined 1% from last year as continued strong momentum in Banking and Securities Services were offset by a decline in Markets revenues,neg,train
Securities Services grew 8% as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment,neg,train
"Yes, just wanted to understand whether you think about pricing is actually going a bit lower",neg,train
So it's not only about volumes anymore but actually pricing becomes part of the issue going forward,neg,train
"I don't have that broken out, but obviously mix is definitely playing a role in NIM",neg,train
"So if you take a look at our core NIM, which declined 2 basis points for the quarter and maybe it was roughly 5 basis points for the full year, in the quarter, the decline really was just due to the impact of currency rates",neg,train
"The election, obviously, we're watching and we'll see how that unfolds",neg,train
We increased our return on assets to 84 basis points,neg,train
"Our return on tangible common equity, including and excluding DTA, increased to 8",neg,train
"Yes, which is why we put forward the guidance of low 50s by 2020",neg,train
"And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions",neg,train
"And retail services - and in retail services, our full year NCL rate was 473 basis points",neg,train
This is consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 500 basis points for 2018 and up to 525 basis points over the medium term,neg,train
"Yes, I'm trying to think about why would our structure force us to be in there",neg,train
"Based upon our structure, we're really not impacted by the base erosion anti-abuse tax",neg,train
"I - if you ask me, I guess it's probably - our foreign branch structure probably gives us a little bit of help with regard to BEAT maybe compared to others",neg,train

"2 billion were up 9%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with balanced growth across net interest and fee income",neg,train
John also talked about the mix of our business being a bit different,neg,train
It - everything that we're talking about right now is clearly in line,neg,train
We never gave - with what we put up in Investor Day,neg,test
"I don't think we ever talked about a very specific 2018 goal at that point, but getting another 100 basis point reduction fits in with the pace that we had built into that Investor Day presentation",neg,test
Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank,neg,test
"Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the fourth quarter with broad-based volume growth across deposits, commercial loans and personal loans, as well as improved deposit spreads",neg,train
And card revenue growth improved to 4% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans,neg,train
"The charge we're taking relates mostly to the reduction of the value of our deferred tax assets as a result of a lower corporate tax rate, the implementation of a territorial tax system and the tax on deemed repatriation",neg,train
"As we look forward, we expect interest earning balances to continue to grow while promotional rate loans should stabilize and then begin to decline in 2018 as we continue to take actions to adjust our acquisition strategy in a rising rate environment",neg,train
These actions include shortening or eliminating the promotional period on certain offers while continuing to optimize our mix of acquisitions by product,neg,train
Our next question is from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale,neg,train
"As we talked last quarter, we actually saw the third quarter produce 2% year-over-year growth in our Mexico cards revenues and now that has accelerated to 4% here in the fourth quarter",neg,test
"One was the branch work we did, the movement to start smart branches",neg,train
"And you go into those branches and watch in terms of what's changed from the reduction in the teller lines and the interaction out in front in terms of some of the machines, 1,600 ATMs with more or increased functionality being put in place",neg,train
"If you think about it, what this means is we put up, I think, at Investor Day a compound annual growth rate for U",neg,train
That probably comes down to 2% just given the fact that 2018 is likely going to be a flat revenue year,neg,train
"7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $1",neg,train
"28 grew 12%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding",neg,train
"I mean, it's a good thought, but really, what's driving our tax rate lower this quarter, that 25",neg,train
"1%, it's really just the - an impact of one episodic item, that one episodic discrete item that was in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"For the full year, on an operating basis, we earned $15",neg,train
"8 billion in net income for 2017, which was nearly $1 billion more than in 2016 and our earnings per share were $5",neg,train
So you've got more certainty in the book value because the uncertain element of the DTA - the value of the DTA has been removed and you've traded that uncertainty for a real improvement in your RoTCE,neg,train
"So again, I think that the trade-off is overall accretive to the value of the stock",neg,train
"When we look at your remaining DTAs at the pace that you outlined, they'll be used up in another 10 years",neg,train
So I'm just wondering if you might revisit your statement from last year where you said the restructuring is over,neg,train
Can you comment on M&A? You've just done M&A as a strategy to deploy capital,neg,test
How do you think about it in terms of your overall capital strategy?,neg,train
"We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 4% year-over-year, excluding our Hilton portfolio, as recent vintages continued to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances",neg,train
"As I noted earlier, we believe we have line of sight to reducing our effective tax rate to 24% over the next two years and, if you look at what was embedded in our Investor Day outlook, we had assumed our effective tax rate would tick up over time to around 33% by 2020",neg,train
The other thing I was going to ask you was we've talked a lot about the improvement in returns and earnings as you go forward but not a lot about reduction in the tangible book value as you change the DTA this quarter,neg,train
It was about a - it looks like about $10 per share that it came down,neg,train
"And then just a clarification, the $800 million grossing up of both revenues and expenses, does that show up - I guess, one, is that part of the 3% revenue growth expectation?",neg,train
And I think what we've talked about and described on this call historically is we don't necessarily measure trading by the quarter,neg,train
"It is oftentimes week to week, it's day to day, and it's very, very much event-driven",neg,train
And so we've talked about an outlook in terms of rates going forward,neg,train
"So if we start to see more rate increases, you could see some more activity around that",neg,train
"Can you talk about the balance between investing for future growth and letting the savings fall to the bottom line? I mean, what are your biggest areas of investment? How much are you investing? Any change in your CapEx budget or anything else along those lines?",neg,train
7% and our tangible book value per share declined to $60,neg,train
"40, including the full impact of the $22 billion non-cash charge related to tax reform",neg,train
Everything is - everything that you just mentioned is - all those factors are in the guidance that we gave you,neg,test
"One of the things that we always point to, especially in our rates and currencies business, is that a large percentage of our client revenues come from corporate clients",neg,train
They got to think in terms of working capital management,neg,train
Both of those things would be beneficial to the economy,neg,test
"Both of those things would be beneficial to consumers, and they both should be beneficial to us",neg,train
"In summary, we made good progress in 2017 with broad based revenue growth, positive operating leverage, earnings growth and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders",neg,test
"When you think in terms of the dampening of some of the new terms, I think when we, for instance, just to point to one example, when we renewed the American contract a couple of years ago, we talked to the fact that there was some additional revenue sharing that came into play beginning in 2018",neg,train
"But with this performance, as I mentioned, let's stay with Mexico cards",neg,train
"For about 6 quarters in a row, we saw declining revenue growth year-over-year in cards",neg,train
We began earlier this year to see that year-over-year revenue shortfall decline,neg,train
"It was lessening, but we wouldn't think that we were going to return to year-over-year revenue growth until the fourth quarter of this year",neg,test
Total Consumer revenues grew 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter,neg,train
"Retail banking grew 5% driven by our Wealth Management business, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues",neg,train
"And card revenues grew by 11%, reflecting continued growth in average loans and purchase sales as well as a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business",neg,train
"There's still some - there's - potentially as you kind of -- the investments start to trail off and you get these process improvements, you might see more of a step down in '19 or '20?",neg,train
And the reason I'm getting at that is there's been about half the banks that had this particular impact in this particular quarter before we got into the actual rate going down,neg,train
You mentioned last quarter that you were seeing stabilization in the collections rates,neg,train
Are you seeing any improvement quarter-over-quarter on those collection rates? Thanks,neg,train
We've got infrastructure in our consumer business that already has us at scale,neg,train
"Well, we continue to see strong fee growth in our TTS business, just to name one, both in cash fees as well as from the commercial cards business",neg,train
"Sorry, Matt, I just can't go down line item detail by business in my head",neg,train
You gave - you reiterated the guidance on the NCL rate both for branded cards and retail services,neg,train
"But I mean, shouldn't your borrowers or customers also benefit from tax reform?",neg,test
"Now that means that the balance -- you got to think about it as primarily being funded by debt, some form of debt with 3 months' LIBOR rate as a good proxy to the cost of that funding",neg,train
"So obviously, as we've seen 3-month LIBOR is steadily increasing, well, we've seen trading-related NIR decline",neg,train
We've always had the deferred tax assets in our tangible book value and our total book value,neg,train
And I think many have questions as far as the future value of those things,neg,train
We always thought of those as being something that you would look at more on an annuity basis because we knew that you'd be getting the value of those assets over time,neg,train
"So when we think of M&A, we don't think of being out there and buying another bank or a big bank",neg,train
"A couple of things, one is from a regulatory perspective, not just for us, but certainly for the bigger banks in the industry, that would probably be challenged from a regulatory approval perspective",neg,train
"And in Equities, we made solid progress with our target investor clients, improving wallet share and growing client balances in line with our investment plans",neg,test
"And then when you look at digital, actually, when we look year-over-year, we've got an increase of 38% of digital engagement in Mexico, above our expectations",neg,train
"This brings me to my final takeaway, which is our confidence in steadily improving our RoTCE",neg,train
"Our RoTCE, excluding the impact of disallowed DTA, improved to 9",neg,test
"6% in 2017, showing good progress towards our original Investor Day target of a 10% return on this basis in 2018",neg,train
So I don't want you to think that we are upping the guidance from Investor Day,neg,train
Revenues of $746 million declined 13% from last year driven by the wind down of legacy assets,neg,train
Expenses were down 24% also reflecting the wind down as well as lower legal expenses,neg,train
"And finally, the combination of a lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income along with the $22 billion reduction in our tangible common equity is expected to drive a material improvement in returns, adding roughly 200 basis points to our RoTCE going forward",neg,train
"I'm wondering why fees aren't expected to grow, if that is the right interpretation, and then just some of the puts and takes on the fee business",neg,test
Thank you for taking my questions and for the presentation,neg,train
My first question is regarding the outlook that you have for 2018 and going forward on your IB trading business,neg,train
"Overall, I just want to know if you think that the tax reform will be enough to kick the period in Q1 and Q2 effectively and offset the prolonged low volatility",neg,train
"In terms of earnings power, the macro backdrop has only gotten stronger with all major global markets having returned to growth and the US poised to benefit from a more competitive tax regime",neg,train
Higher GDP growth or additional US interest rate hikes beyond the one we have embedded in this year's plan would provide a tailwind for us,neg,train
Just had a following question on the trading NII that you talked about earlier,neg,train
"I mean, as the 3 months LIBOR keeps on going up, I guess, theoretically, this might head down towards 0 and maybe even negative",neg,train
"For the full year 2018, we expect top line growth broadly in line with the medium term outlook we described in July at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets",neg,train
"And then, in terms of the card revenues, I guess, first, on the US branded card",neg,train
You mentioned that the revenue growth of 2% in 2018 will be offset by certain partnership renewals,neg,train
Can you just mention what's going on with the renewals there?,neg,train

"3 billion grew 1% from the prior year, reflecting 2% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets",neg,train
"As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11",neg,train
2 billion in the fourth quarter was essentially flat to last year,neg,train
"Core accrual revenues grew year-over-year by over $500 million in the fourth quarter, in line with our outlook, but this was offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets",neg,train
"We expect to achieve another 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio on a like-for-like basis, keeping in mind that we just adopted new rules on revenue recognition that will gross up both revenues and expenses by about $800 million annually with no impact on earnings",neg,train
Our NCL rate in US branded cards was 289 basis points for full year 2017,neg,train
We remain comfortable with an NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points for 2018 and up to 325 basis points over the medium term,neg,train
I want to follow up on the 3% revenue growth outlook for 2018,neg,train
It seems like its implying flattish fee revenues if we kind of just take the math literally,neg,test
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein,neg,train
It had nothing to do with the future tax rate going down?,neg,test
"But underneath that, what we've seen is a change in mix",neg,train
"So our corporate loans, which have good but lower NIM than - our corporate loans are growing faster than our consumer loans",neg,train
"And therefore, we've got a change in mix that is certainly contributing to that flattish NIM on a sequential basis and also contributing to the somewhat flattish NIM on a year-over-year basis as well",neg,train
"Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corp/Other",neg,train
We weren't reliant on any one product or any one region,neg,train
"And so I don't think it's unusual that you're going to see some, you know, there'll be some gains in one product and a shortfall in others, but overall, still in line",neg,train
"And I may have missed it, but have you guys announced any type of wage increases for your folks? I know some of the other banks have announced the hourly earnings going up and stuff and onetime bonuses",neg,train
So we really encourage you to look at the overall revenue performance in these trading businesses,neg,train
"And when you take a look at our FICC trading business, it's either number one or number two",neg,train
"So no, we're not going to shut down our FICC business because of trading related net interest revenue",neg,train
"We'll benefit from the lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income going forward",neg,train
"We believe the combination of higher income and reduced tangible common equity will have a meaningful positive impact on our returns, improving return on tangible common equity by about 200 basis points going forward",neg,train
"If you have any questions, please reach out to Investor Relations",neg,train
"But the branches - again, branches are taxed as part of the - or considered part of the U",neg,train
"So now, just given the fact that - the assumption is that deposit beta will continue to increase, that's why the new guidance would be closer to $80 million",neg,train
We again had revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both the US and our international franchise,neg,train
"As we look at the numbers, you've seen the Mexican economy underperforming",neg,train
"I think, right now, growth forecasts look like Mexico is probably going to come in somewhere around 2",neg,train
"On Slide 8, we show our results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars",neg,train
"Net income grew 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline",neg,test
2 billion grew by 7% with contribution from every business and region,neg,train
"So you look at Mexico, yes, we got 6% revenue growth, but we did that inclusive of investment with 4% expense growth",neg,train
7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 or $1,neg,train
"During the quarter, we again showed growth in many of the products we've been investing in and increased loans in both sides of our house",neg,test
"And while there are lots of moving pieces, we believe our ability to generate regulatory capital has only improved post tax reform as higher net income should more than offset any reduction in our annual DTA utilization",neg,train
"So just if we got a rate hike in March of 25 basis points and then we still got that midyear rate hike, that would give you 3 quarters of additional rates - of additional 25 basis point rate hikes so that should would translate to $240 million, $250 million of additional core accrual NIM - NIR, sorry",neg,train
"On a full year basis, total revenues grew 2% in 2017, including 6% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses",neg,train
"Total expenses remained flat, driving over 150 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, and net income grew 6%, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks",neg,train
"If anything, that ability has been enhanced by tax reform",neg,train
"The - there are several, I think, that you should track us on",neg,train
"One is we've talked about one of the key elements, obviously, in driving the revenue growth in branded cards is the continued growth in interest-earning balances",neg,train
"Average loan growth in ICG was good, 8%, and I think no matter what form it comes in is typically pretty good",neg,train
"And finally, revenues in Corp/Other declined significantly year-over-year by roughly $2 billion",neg,train
We expect the wind down of legacy assets to continue to be a drag on top line results over the medium term,neg,train
So it seems to imply that there's some back-ended acceleration and efficiency improvement,neg,train
Is that the right way to think about it and where is that coming from in '19 and in '20?,neg,train
"Gerard, I think it will - it already has, at least in rhetoric, started to put pressure, in particular, on some of those higher-tax economies",neg,train
"The challenge is when you get into those economies from a fiscal perspective, they don't necessarily have the latitude, the leeway or the ability to significantly cut taxes",neg,train
"Excluding the impact of tax reform, our return on total tangible common equity improved to roughly 8% in 2017 and we expect to make additional progress this year",neg,train
"So including the impact of tax reform, which benefits our returns by an estimated 200 basis points, we should be able to generate an RoTCE approaching 10",neg,train
"So again, that just demonstrates to us that we're on that path then to deliver the overall revenue growth that we have built into those medium term outlooks for cards in Mexico, which was in that 9%, 10% range",neg,train
"But net-net if we don't get NAFTA, net-net if we end up with the election with a more leftist candidate, it will likely hurt the economy from here",neg,train
"And then second, when the term expires, what's the roll-off for customers actually to give the card back to you or take the balance down to zero?",neg,train
"And if you look at the increase in your returns, incrementally, it could add $1 to $1",neg,train
So it's going to take a while to get back up from where we're at,neg,train
I just was curious how you all thought about that in the sense of the dilution that you took upfront with the write-off,neg,train
"John, I was wondering on the net interest income outlook, the core accrual NII for $2",neg,train
"So many folks are assuming more rate hikes for this year, 2 or 3, sometimes 4",neg,test
"I think the rule of thumb, John, would be that for each additional quarter that we had an incremental 25 basis point rate - impact of - a Fed rate hike, we should see an increment of about $80 million of core interest revenue",neg,train
"At the same point in time, retail services, we had, I think a 1% compound annual growth rate built in and we feel pretty good now about that looking more like a 2% growth rate",neg,train
"And then lastly, John, on the promotional rates that you talked about in credit cards, what's the typical normal term in terms of if somebody takes down one of your cards with a promotional rate, is it 6 months, 12 months?",neg,train
Slide 6 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars,neg,train
Net income grew 8% in the fourth quarter as growth in operating margin outpaced a higher cost of credit,neg,train
I appreciate the 200 basis point boost to the return on tangible targets,neg,train
Is it simple math? Can I think about that EPS range that you talked about going up by a similar percentage?,neg,test
"In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year-over-year to $667 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other",neg,train
"Importantly, we continued to deepen our client relationships and lay the foundation for sustainable client led growth and steady improvement in returns over time",neg,train
We remain committed to our medium and longer term return targets and expect to show continued progress in 2018,neg,train
"And this year, in rates and currencies, corporate clients formed 45% of our client revenues, and even in a year where overall client revenues declined in the industry, we actually had a 5% growth in our corporate client revenue",neg,train
So that was enough to actually generate an overall increase for us in client revenues in our rates and currencies business,neg,train
"Well, the investment in Mexico, again, that's sort of embedded in what I was talking about with the Consumer",neg,train
"It's only if you put investment dollars to work in 2017, you'll get some benefit in '18",neg,train
You'll get even more benefit coming out of that in '19 and '20,neg,train
Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail,neg,train
"So those are some of the things - so - but overall, we say - and again, if you - it should be flattish revenues for 2018, and then revenue should begin to grow in 2019, basically delaying our growth profile in cards by about a year",neg,train
"As you know, our net income for the fourth quarter and the year reflect the impact of the onetime non-cash charge due to tax reform and I'll go into some more detail about that after I discuss our business performance",neg,train
Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America,neg,train
If you go back a year or so - I think I was asked that same question,neg,test
"The guidance then would have been - for 25 basis points, we would have expected roughly 100",neg,train
"However, we faced continued headwinds from growth in transactor and promotional rate balances, which we are funding at a higher cost versus last year given the higher interest rate environment",neg,test
"So one, I think I described and John described a couple of things, both on a relative and an absolute basis",neg,train
"So on a relative basis, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year comparisons coming out of 2016 with the elections, obviously, activity was down a bit",neg,train
"I don't have my line item detail on 2018, but I don't think you're getting to the right conclusion",neg,train
And I noticed that - I think you mentioned it didn't really have a much impact on you,neg,train
Could you just give us some color as to why that's the case or how you're structured in a way that enables you to avoid that?,neg,train
"So Mike, we've been - when you go back and think about what we talked about at Investor Day and the pathway to a low 50s efficiency, as John described earlier, there's the concept of balance in there, but it's a bit of revenue and it's expense",neg,train
"It's clearly - well, I don't want to put words in your mouth",neg,train
"How much of it relates towards the teaser and the promotional books and the transactor books? And does that run off with the same comments, at the same pace as you talked about, the revenue improvement?",neg,train
"The - again, we're still going through a lot of this work, right? But where we are right now, while our DTA - the disallowed DTA was basically cut in half, actually more than half, $28 billion down to $13 billion, our current assessment would be that our DTA - our annual DTA utilization is basically reduced by about 1/3",neg,train
We're achieving revenue growth in cards somewhat earlier than we had planned and this should contribute to an acceleration in growth for overall Latin America Consumer revenues as we go in into 2018,neg,train
"On an ongoing basis, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate, going from the low 30% range down to an estimated 25% rate in 2018 with a line of sight to a 24% rate over the next 2 years",neg,train
Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities,neg,train
"Equities revenues were down 23%, mostly driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client event",neg,test
"Excluding this item, Equities revenues declined by 4% from last year, reflecting lower activity in corporate equity derivatives, while investor client engagement remains strong",neg,train
"And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 14% driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue",neg,train
"And so now we've got sequential growth in those balances for the second quarter in a row, so that puts us on a good pace",neg,test
"We've mentioned last quarter, we touched on it again this quarter, that one of the dampening effects, though, even as we're growing those interest-earning balances, we have a higher than - a higher level of promo balances that we had originally expected to have because of the change in acquisition strategy",neg,train
"And then, John, as far as the efficiency target, you were at 58% in 2017, and now you're looking for 100 basis points better, so 57%",neg,train
"Well, we obviously pay a lot of attention to it, Saul, and we are watching it closely",neg,train
"And if you look at NAFTA, clearly, we believe the benefits to the U",neg,train
"From a business perspective, it's a great opportunity to advise our clients on how they can optimize their models to fit the new tax regime",neg,train
Everything from repatriation to supply chain is on the table and we're already engaged in these conversations with our clients,neg,train
"And then just on the net charge-off guidance that you've given there, what kind of interest rates do you look at in terms of giving that guidance? And how should we look at that, too, from a macro perspective? Do you look at like the short end, 1 to 2 years or is it increasingly like the 5 years as corporates and so forth have termed out their borrowing?",neg,train
"So I was thinking that would force out why you're thinking you're down at 24%, too, down the road?",neg,test
"Just maybe on the efficiency ratio, I think you've got it to about 100 basis point improvement in '18, but I think the target for 2020 is the low 50s and 100 basis points will get you closer to, I guess, 57",neg,train
"So we're managing those promo -- the promo balance line as you would expect us to, given, one, the strong take-up that we had on the other offers; and two, just given the environment that we're in",neg,train
"So I mean, is there some chance that you come in better than that guidance post tax reform?",neg,train
"And then that shows up in the fee revenues versus net interest income, right?",neg,train
"As noted on the table, our fourth quarter results included a onetime non-cash charge of $22 billion or $8",neg,train
43 per share comprised of roughly $19 billion due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets or DTA arising from the lower US corporate tax rate as well as the shift to a territorial regime and roughly $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of un-remitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries,neg,train
"From a reporting perspective, the entire $22 billion charge was recorded in the tax line in our Corp/Other segment",neg,train
"It's generating good net interest revenue, that's why you're seeing the growth",neg,train
"And you have $2 billion of core accrual net interest revenue growth for the full year, $520 million of that in the fourth quarter",neg,train
"But just given the fact that a lot of that is coming off of the corporate loans, it's changing - it's depressing the overall level of NIM at this point in time",neg,train
"And the pretax loss in Corp/Other was $66 million this quarter, better than our outlook, mostly due to higher than expected hedging-related revenues in Treasury",neg,train
"However, we continue to believe an outlook for pretax losses of $250 million to $300 million per quarter in Corp/Other is a fair run rate to expect through 2018",neg,train
"Net credit losses grew by 7% year-over-year and we built roughly $150 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios",neg,train
"We really haven't seen - I mean, the retail services business is moving along very nicely",neg,train
I mentioned the fact that the revenue growth is actually higher than what we had originally expected,neg,train
"We've got excellent engagement with our clients there, and I've said that we're working well with each one of our retailers",neg,train
Pricing has certainly been an issue in that business for the last several years,neg,test
"And I think you have to assume that, that continues",neg,train
That's one of the reasons why we talked about this really being a scale business,neg,train
"If you're not prepared to make the investments in technology, which we've done, and if you don't have that good client base in order to work with, you're going to be in trouble",neg,train
"While the GAAP charge is large, it's important to note that the impact on our regulatory capital is far smaller at about $6 billion",neg,train
"Even after this charge, we have a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12",neg,train
"For the full year 2017, our net income grew 16% on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline",neg,train
"We generated over half of our revenues in Banking, which grew 12% on continued momentum in TTS, Investment Banking, the Private Bank and Corporate Lending",neg,train
So you don't feel like you need any branch infrastructure outside of your core 6 markets in the U,neg,train
"consumer should also benefit as higher take-home pay could drive either increased discretionary spending or the acceleration of payment of existing debt, each a potential positive outcome from the reduction in tax rates",neg,train
"From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint",neg,train
And global cards delivered 3% revenue growth driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region,neg,test
"But Al, I understand when you say IB, you actually mean sales and trading as part of",neg,train
How much would your outlook for net interest income increase if we saw 2 or 3 hikes rather than the one you've embedded in your outlook?,neg,train
"Kind of question is if we could turn it around, obviously, the benefits to this country from the lower tax rates have been explained by you and others",neg,train
You're in a unique position to give us a view of what it might do to some of the other - we have the non-US countries that obviously are not lowering their tax rates,neg,train
"Hello and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach",neg,train
"Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today",neg,train
"If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time",neg,train
"Despite the charge we took for tax reform, our capital position remains strong and we are on track to return at least $60 billion in capital over the 2017, '18 and '19 CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval",neg,train
So it's not just the in-store purchase activity that is driving that business,neg,train
"Also, for many of the cards where we've got general purpose cards out there, and so it's much more of a co-brand relationship, we're seeing good out-of-store purchase activity as well",neg,train
And the math would suggest that it's probably closer to a 300 basis point improvement in RoTCE in 2020,neg,train
"So there's actually some dry powder above that 200 basis points right now, and we'll get more specific with you as 2018 continues",neg,test
"But in terms of the dialogues we're in, everybody's taking a look at everything, from what repatriation means, to supply chain, to legal vehicle structure, to tax domicile",neg,train
"When we try to put models into play, we take a look at the overall economic environment, including where we think the -- where we see interest rates going, which is a combination of short end and long end, which is going to have different behavioral impacts on either consumers or corporate clients",neg,test
"But I think, John, if you look at it as an example, fee growth, where you think of where we've seen good growth, Matt, is when you look in the banking products, when you look at, as John talked about, market share gains in M&A, you look at what we've done in terms of the private bank, securities services, lending, those more accrual type revenues have been strong",neg,train
"In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth and nearly 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio",neg,train
"In ICG, revenues grew 7% with 200 basis points of efficiency improvement",neg,train
"Of course, our ICG results benefited from a gain on sale in the third quarter, but even excluding the gain, we generated 6% revenue growth and over 100 basis points of efficiency improvement in 2017",neg,train
The impact on our CET1 capital was significantly smaller at approximately $6 billion or a 40 basis point reduction in our CET1 capital ratio,neg,train
"In Global Consumer, we finished with a very strong second half in Asia and we returned to growth in Mexico cards earlier than we had planned, giving us confidence that we can accelerate our overall revenue growth in Mexico",neg,train
"But are you concerned at all about the macro backdrop? There has been a pretty pronounced slowdown in loan growth in the fourth quarter in Mexico, and that includes cards",neg,train
The question - the follow-up is just on retail partner cards,neg,train
We haven't spoken so much on this call about that,neg,train
Could you give a sense of the strategy there? And one of your partners is closing stores,neg,train
Are you seeing an impact on that or not? Give us some sense of how you're managing that business,neg,train
"The growth in promotional rate balances reflects a strong response to our offers, generating growth in both spending and borrowing activity from new accounts during the promotional period",neg,train
"And then, on the International Consumer, it looks like both Latin America and Asia Consumer revenues have accelerated and are showing good momentum",neg,train
"Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and that inflection in Mexico Consumer, as well as Asia on a core basis and maybe what kind of revenue growth expectations you might have on the International Consumer front?",neg,train
"When you look at the tax rate for this particular quarter and it being down lower, is that a reflection of when you kind of look at your expectations or reserves against taxes, you have that, and as the tax rate is going down in the future, you would adjust the reserves that you need on potential benefit?",neg,train
"We've already mentioned the higher funding costs, but I'm wondering whether you think that you're now facing high competition from your bank peers or a new competition from fintech? Thank you very much",neg,train
I'm just trying to figure out if you can get where you're going a little bit faster and if you're satisfied with the progress,neg,train
"I mean, when we look at Mexico, when we look at TTS, when we look at the key metrics, they're moving in the right direction",neg,test
"But then we go back to your old ROA target from 2015 and say, wow, you'll still be getting there in 2020, so that's 5 years later than before",neg,train
"And you mentioned overall, even with US card being a little light, your overall Consumer revenue trajectory feels good relative to the Investor Day targets?",neg,train
"As far as the acceleration of revenue, yes, the expectation would be revenue growth should be - should accelerate in the tail half, the second half of 2018 and then be fully visible from a full year point of view in 2019",neg,train
"Again, all excluding the impact that you're going to see quarter to quarter as a result of the sale of the Hilton portfolio",neg,train
"Yes, and we definitely have seen improvement in line with our expectations",neg,train
"And so, again, that's one of the reasons why we were reaffirming the view towards a 5% NCL rate in retail services -- approximate 5% NCL rate in retail services in 2018",neg,train
"And again, we're reaffirming the guidance of around a 300 basis point NCL rate in U",neg,train
"However, this growth should largely be offset by the impact of additional terms that go into effect this quarter in certain of our partnership contracts",neg,train
"And as previously noted, we expect to close the sale of the Hilton portfolio this quarter",neg,train
"And then the other question is, in your core, are you contemplating both the Hilton sale, as well as the delta to your just FTE component, which I know is not a big number, but is that all contemplated in the other 2 components?",neg,train
"You've seen, I think, the result of that as far as on the impact on the operating efficiency improvement that we've seen in Consumer",neg,train
And you can see the improvement that we're getting in ICG,neg,train
"We've got 4% growth we quoted, excluding, again, the Hilton portfolio",neg,train
"But ex the Hilton portfolio, we've gotten now 4% growth in the fourth quarter year-over-year",neg,train
So I don't think you should expect anything significant away from that,neg,train
"With that, John will go through the presentation and we'd be happy to answer your questions",neg,train
"And the second question, which is effectively a follow-up of this question, is whether you see any significant margin pressure at the moment in your IB trading product",neg,train
"And if you do, I'm just trying to find the - what you think is the primary reason",neg,train
"Excluding the gain, card revenues increased by 7% in the fourth quarter",neg,test
"On a full year basis, Asia Consumer revenues grew by 5% in 2017 and 4%, excluding NIMs [ph]",neg,train
"In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings",neg,train
Total expenses for North America Consumer were flat to last year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings,neg,train
Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year with half the decline coming from lower escrow balances given the lower mortgage activity,neg,train
"And we expect there to be some action, reaction and some movement, which, from a business perspective, should benefit us",neg,train
"And it is that combination, Glenn, that you were talking about as far as even as we're seeing growth in the interest earning balances, we do have that drag from promotional balances",neg,train
"In the US, while branded cards has gotten off to a slow start, likely delaying growth in that business until 2019, we showed good traction with our Citigold Wealth Management investment and retail services is growing at slightly above our medium-term outlook",neg,train
We also demonstrated strong expense discipline and overall credit remains benign,neg,train
"GCB and ICG loans grew by $41 billion in total with contribution from every region in Consumer as well as TTS, the Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending",neg,train
"The Institutional Clients Group saw continued momentum with double-digit growth in its banking products comprised of TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Corporate Lending",neg,train
"We did have a decline in Markets revenue due to a less robust environment this quarter than in the period following the US election last year, but engagement remains strong with our target clients",neg,train
Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"And again, we don't see anything in the environment that takes away from the outlook of those remaining strong",neg,train
I think John's talked about a backdrop where we'll see trading remains choppy,neg,train
"But again, we've got an interest rate outlook that, by some people's standards, remains conservative",neg,train
The macro environment is as positive as we've seen in many years,neg,train
2017 was the first year since the crisis in which growth actually exceeded expectations,neg,train
Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the US economy needs to drive growth higher,neg,train
Slide 9 shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail by region,neg,train
The NCL rate improved sequentially in both North America and Asia,neg,train
And trading related net interest revenue declined by nearly $1,neg,train
7 billion year-over-year with about 2/3 of this decline coming from higher wholesale funding costs,neg,train
"As we look to 2018, we expect core accrual net interest revenues to grow by another $2",neg,train
"5 billion year-over-year driven by loan growth, mix improvement and the benefit of higher rates assuming one additional Fed rate increase mid year",neg,train
"But the bulk of it, and I just don't have a percentage in my mind, whether it's 2/3 or thereabouts or even 3/4, is really what you would consider to be, I guess, normal ongoing lending arrangements, just straight-on commercial loans, loans in the private bank, trade loans in TTS, et cetera, et cetera",neg,test
So we feel -- we do feel good about that loan growth in ICG,neg,train
Legacy asset related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million during the year as we continue to wind down that portfolio,neg,test
And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment,neg,train
"Yes, if you take a look at the - I'm not quite sure that there's a norm because each product has got its own offering",neg,train
"However, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise",neg,train
"Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 14% driven by continued growth in checking deposits and deposit margin, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity",neg,train
This growth rate accelerated from 4% in the third quarter on better momentum across both retail banking and cards,neg,train
Our progress was broad-based in 2017 with revenue growth and positive operating leverage and operating margin expansion in our Institutional business as well as every region in Consumer,neg,train
"We also had two more quarters of operating performance behind us, extending our track record in areas like TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Securities Services and ICG",neg,train
"And in Latin America, the sequential increase in the NCL rate reflected an episodic commercial charge-off while delinquencies continued to improve",neg,train
Those are going to require some additional effort in 2018 before you begin to see the results of that coming into play in '19 and '20,neg,train
"So we picked up 900 basis points of benefit in our effective tax rate and only lost $600 million, $650 million worth of DTA utilization in any given year",neg,train
"And is that somewhat tied to the investment in Mexico as that finally kind of rolls off maybe in '19 and '20 as well, so that's how we should think about that?",neg,train
"I think all of that is what's coming through in the strong revenue performance in retail services, even as some retailers are closing stores",neg,train
"Don't forget, in retail services, some of our cards are general purpose cards, and we're seeing real good out-of-store purchases off of those cards as well",neg,train
"Just wanted to ask on a question on aging populations and people living along or just curious how you're thinking about the impact this could have on asset flows for the industry and does money stay invested for longer, creating a sticky asset base",neg,train
"And then somewhat related to that would be, what opportunities do you see to innovate by linking asset management with insurance and technology around, as I'm thinking about your iRetire technology, what role could there be for insurance here and helping with people -- aging populations and people living longer?",neg,train
We talk about long-term strategy and where we need to be working on,neg,train
You brought up one important point that we are working on and that is how do we transform retirement in the world,neg,train
Your next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse,neg,train
It’s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017,neg,train
"Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I’ll review our financial performance and business results",neg,train
"While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results this morning",neg,train
"So, Bill, to your first part of your question on G&A, so, yes higher year-over-year G&A and frankly also sequential G&A was driven by a number of, what we would consider, manageable core decisions that we’re obviously very conscious, like technology, data, M&P, obviously, some occupancy as our headcount is growing",neg,train
"And the higher annual G&A expense, which was up about 12% clearly reflected, a, as we've talked about, a specific goal of ours of continuing to invest in core technology and data",neg,train
"Technology is impacting businesses like cash management as well and in 2017, we acquired Cachematrix, a technology portal that enhances banks' abilities to address our corporate clients’ cash management needs",neg,train
BlackRock saw 38 billion of net inflows into cash management strategies in 2017 and we now manage $450 billion in cash assets as the investments we made to grow and scale this business over the last few years are bearing wonderful results,neg,train
"So, we’re higher than the 30% that you're talking about",neg,train
We’re one of the largest traders of fixed income instruments,neg,train
So we are involved and invested in various methods to trade electronically,neg,test
We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base,neg,test
"While we would expect 2018 G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we would also expect compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of historical investment and increased scale in our business, resulting in continued upward bias in our operating margin",neg,train
BlackRock’s record 2017 financial performance reflects these historical investments and the strength of our globally integrated asset management and technology business,neg,test
"It's just part of the normal growth, I believe of any product on a distribution platform",neg,train
Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley,neg,train
"We have -- as you know, we do not go to the last mile and work with any individual client",neg,train
Our business model is to work with distribution platforms and helping them navigate their clients,neg,train
So I would state that these changes that you're seeing in some of the distribution platforms plays very well into the BlackRock business model,neg,train
"With more assets under management on behalf of more diverse client base than ever before, the responsibility BlackRock feels to our clients has never been greater",neg,train
"So, if I had to make a bias, the trends of using fewer investment managers is not a new phenomenon",neg,train
"I don't even think it’s a new phenomenon for ETFs, but that trend has been existing for years, and because of our business model, that plays quite well with our business model working with all distribution platforms and we don't compete with our distribution partners",neg,train
"In addition, subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating $1",neg,train
It is a dedication of our employees across the globe that drove our 2017 results and positions us well for 2018,neg,train
"BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 12, 2018  8:30 AM ET",neg,train
"Record iShares inflows of 245 billion in 2017, including $55 billion in our fourth quarter earned iShares the number one share of global, US and European flows for the year as well the number one share in equity and fixed income and in core exposures and also in smart beta",neg,train
"Growth has been driven by our commitment to provide clients with a differentiating offering, capital markets and technical product expertise, a diverse set of products ranging from the established industry benchmarks to innovative exposures, investment thought leadership and importantly distribution technology",neg,train
"The annual, the year-over-year, the sequential, all three frankly also reflect the impact of a number of one-off items",neg,train
"We tried to highlight some of those, professional fees were higher related to a bunch of things",neg,train
We have a bunch of stuff that was done in the fourth quarter in anticipation of tax reform as well as a number of other things that just kind of hit FX re-measurement expense,neg,train
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing technical difficulties, if you could please hold the line",neg,train
"We are experiencing technical difficulties, if you could just remain on the line",neg,train
"Finally, BlackRock’s cash management platform saw $38 billion of net inflows or 9% organic growth for the year, reflecting continued market share gains and several large wins",neg,train
The strong growth in cash management also reflects successful identification and integration of acquisitions to strengthen our platform and leverage our scale,neg,train
I guess I wanted to ask you around the tax reform,neg,train
"I also believe, there are so many people in the world who are sitting at 50 years old and are unprepared because under investment in their retirement and the over dependency of cash and bonds",neg,train
"We continue to invest in our business, while simultaneously expanding our full year operating margin by 40 basis points; and after first investing for growth, we returned approximately $2",neg,train
8 billion of capital to our shareholders during the year,neg,train
"5 billion was up 12% versus 2016, and operating income of $5",neg,train
We saw accelerated momentum in the fourth quarter with revenue and operating income increasing 20% and 21% respectively versus the year ago quarter,neg,test
"Just wanted to get your perspective on the electronification of fixed income, I saw a recent headline that BlackRock and one of your biggest competitors plan to go fully electronic in bond trading which would be up from the 30% of bond volumes that you trade today",neg,train
So what are you specifically doing in that area and how fast do you think you can get there?,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train

I'd like to thank everyone with this call and wish everybody a Happy New Year and hopefully our year continues as robust as it has in the first 12 days of the year,neg,train
My name is Shinger and I will be your conference facilitator today,neg,test
"At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Teleconference",neg,train
"And now with all of the regulatory issues and where there has been fee pressure, you have a whole new group of people that are using them to substitute in the active space, because it's obviously much, much cheaper",neg,train
"But clearly, when you take a look at what scientific active equity offers, it is a lot of signals that are very short-term oriented, and if you look at fundamentals, there is a lot of work that's on long-term signals",neg,train
It just makes sense to us to combine the two because they both are related to each other,neg,train
"During 2017, our differentiated platform delivered 7% long-term organic base fee growth, 9% organic asset growth in our cash platform, and 14% growth in our technology and risk management revenue, while also expanding our operating margin to 44",neg,train
"We do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but we are always margin aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible",neg,train
"We have a robust leadership plan that we regularly review with our board, including ongoing development initiatives for our senior team",neg,train
"It's the RIA channel, as you mentioned, who are also trying to customize solutions and quite frankly, it's a lot of asset managers that are using iShares as a technology to have more operating efficiency in their portfolios and not have as many line items",neg,train
We have looked at technology as a major component of how we have our trading platform,neg,test
"If you look at the scale of our platform today versus our scale of five years ago, one of the – and why our margins have increased as a firm systematically is the technologies that we utilize in the operations or platform",neg,train
And the trading platform that we have today is mostly driven through technology,neg,train
"So quite frankly, we're very optimistic on that and we will be included",neg,test
Let me just close and thank everybody for joining this morning,neg,train
Our end of the year call – our 2017 results are directly linked to the investments we've made over time and importantly I do believe the results that you're seeing in terms of our flows is a direct result of the trust that clients have placed on BlackRock,neg,train
"9 billion were up 16% year-over-year, driven by market appreciation and organic growth",neg,train
"Full year base fees were up 10% versus 2016, reflecting similar growth dynamics, but partially offset by the impact of historical pricing investments in our iShares business",neg,train
Fourth quarter performance fees of $285 million reflected strong alpha generation from our diversified hedge fund platform and long-only equity products,neg,train
Full year performance fees of 594 million were up substantially compared to 2016,neg,train
"In the US, strong corporate earnings, increased consumer demand and the reason tax reform have continued to drive strong equity markets",neg,train
"And as the leadership in China continues to gradually address historical leverage levels and pivot towards higher growth areas, Chinese GDP once again expanded at a rate approaching 7%",neg,train
"Yet, we are seeing a paradox of high returns and yet we still see high anxiety",neg,test
"As past prices have instilled more caution in investors, the industry has seen a continued focus on downside risk, putting a premium on lower risk bonds, anchoring interest rates at historical low levels and driving many investors to over allocate to cash and to other safe havens",neg,train
"And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are working with 25% more advisors today than we did a year ago with very little added in cost and so we're doing -- using technology to aid the conversation, to enrich the conversation, to fulfill more information and then follow-up with human connectivity",neg,train
"So that’s probably the most, the best example where we are bringing in more flows",neg,test
We've obviously done a number of deals as well over that period of time,neg,train
"I think, the important thing that we're trying to convey here is that, you can't just look at G&A without looking at the overall discretionary expense base and there is obviously an interplay between our G&A expense and our compensation expense",neg,train
"As we're investing more in data and technology, we continue to change the composition of our employee base and you're actually seeing comp to revenue come down",neg,train
We're very encouraged and we're very encouraged about bringing this all together,neg,train
"It's by having Scalable Capital in Europe, by having FutureAdvisor",neg,train
"These are all connecting and creating more dialog, deeper penetration",neg,test
"Total expense increased 11% in 2017, driven primarily by higher compensation, volume related and G&A expense",neg,train
"For the full year, compensation expense increased $388 million or 10%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income",neg,train
"9% declined 60 basis points versus 2016, driven by the changing composition of our employee base and increased technology investment",neg,train
Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis,neg,test
"I'm curious to hear your thoughts about how access to ETF distribution is evolving globally and how this evolution may impact BlackRock? So, two examples",neg,train
"Ameritrade has changed access on its -- to its ETFs on its commission-free platform, and some ETF providers got kicked off and others got brought on",neg,train
"And then, Vanguard has gotten kicked off in a number of large platforms because they don't pay the platform fees, so does access to ETF distribution play out differently for ETFs than access for mutual fund distributions, distribution sorry",neg,train
"How does this shape the competitive landscape for ETFs? And then I guess lastly, does this drive consolidation in ETFs?",neg,test
"Global iShares generated a record $245 billion of new business for the year, representing full-year organic growth of 19%, with flows split nearly evenly between core and higher fee non-core exposures",neg,train
"Since BlackRock launched the iShares core funds five years ago, we've seen over $275 billion of net inflows, including $122 billion of net inflows in 2017 alone",neg,train
"Three of the industry's top five ETFs in terms of net new assets globally this year were iShares’ core ETFs, IVV or S&P 500 fund, IEFA for developed international market exposure, and IEMG our core emerging markets fund",neg,train
"So while we will continue to focus on managing the entire expense base, as we stated, we would expect 2018 G&A to creep up a little bit, but we would also expect comp to revenue to decline and we don't think any of that will basically impact the unstable markets, the upward bias in our overall margin",neg,train
We are still 100% committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible,neg,train
"That being said, clearly, an increase in incremental cash flow from tax reform could impact likely favorably our capital management decisions and that reflects both potentially dividends and buybacks",neg,train
"And our plan is to, I mean, given the tax reform is basically three weeks old, our plan is to effectively reassess our latest capital management recommendations, probably around mid-year",neg,train
"It is a key reason that BlackRock has been able to grow from 8 people and managing about $1 billion in assets when we founded the firm to nearly 14,000 employees entrusted with $6",neg,train
"Aladdin and our other technologies and risk management offerings generated $677 million of revenues in 2017, representing a 14% year-over-year growth and we now have over 200 Aladdin clients, including more than a half dozen of Aladdin risk for wealth management",neg,train
8 billion to shareholders in a combination of dividends and share repurchases,neg,train
"So, we've never been capital constrained at all and our capital management policies have not changed",neg,train
"And lastly, I would say is people who are innovating now in the smart beta area because we have over 100 funds that are ETFs for smart beta",neg,train
"So, this is a market that really is still in the early stages and every day, we have another client that comes in and finds another use for it",neg,train
"So, I'm just very optimistic on using this as a tool to help clients make better portfolios",neg,train
We have the industry's largest investment stewardship team and rebuilding this team even further as we recognize the growing importance and value of a strong stewardship,neg,train
Your next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs,neg,train
70% and 83% of our fundamental and systematic active equity assets respectively have performed above benchmark or peer mediums for one year and those numbers are 72% and 87% for a three year period of time,neg,train
"Equity markets reached an all-time high in 2017, driven by a synchronized economic growth around the world and continued easy monetary policy",neg,train
"Europe is experiencing its fastest economic expansion since 2011, aided by greater political certainty",neg,train
"After 30 years of stagnation, Japan is once again seeing positive growth",neg,train
"We're committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and obviously overtime, paying out the balance of excess cash in the form of buybacks",neg,train
"So while the reduction in our tax rate that we've talked about will clearly increase our after tax cash flow and obviously earnings per share, it does not impact the basic metrics that you all watch each and every day and we hold ourselves accountable for which is basically delivering revenue, expense, operating income and margin",neg,train
"Well, on iShares specifically, because you phrased there with iShares and you expanded, iShares specifically, I think what is changing the momentum for us in a positive way or enhancing the momentum is we're delivering a better service through technology to more RIAs",neg,train
"Historically, we were weak in the delivery of information and services to the RIA channel",neg,train
"In the conversations that I have with different clients and regulators and politicians worldwide, this is a big question",neg,train
"Unquestionably, I do believe longevity is under appreciated and I believe we have not adequately conveyed what it means to be a long term investor, because I think people are living longer and are in a state of retirement longer",neg,train
The big issue that we all are trying to address is how do we help more and more people when they're in the de-accumulation phase? What type of advice?,neg,train
We've invested in a number of digital wealth technologies to better serve our distribution partners in a changing wealth landscape,neg,train
"From our roots in 1988 as a fixed income manager, we've invested over time to expand the breadth, the globality of our businesses to stay ahead of our clients' needs and we're seeing the benefits of those investments in our results today",neg,train
"In 2017, 13 countries and 68 different products generated more than $1 billion of net inflows",neg,train
BlackRock’s technology is now used by clients in 50 countries and more people than ever before are looking to BlackRock as a thought leader as evidenced by over 8000 media mentions received through the Black Rock Investment Institute in 2017,neg,train
Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $81 billion reflected 6% annualized organic asset growth and marked our sixth consecutive quarter with organic AUM growth in excess of 5%,neg,train
"Record full year total inflows of $367 billion benefited from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures, and financial instruments",neg,train
"In terms of technology overall, we have a very robust pipeline for Aladdin, for wealth management",neg,train
"And I would also say one of the most important things about electronic trading and utilization of Aladdin, it brings down operational errors",neg,train
"So, it is a major component of what we do and we're very proud of the trading platform that we created and the efficiencies it has created for us on behalf of our clients",neg,train
"2017 was a record year for BlackRock, and we once again executed on each component of our framework for shareholder value creation",neg,train
"BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows in 2017, including 103 billion of total flows in the fourth quarter, representing 7% organic asset growth and the strongest flows in our history",neg,train
"Full year net inflows were positive across client type, asset class, major region, and investment style",neg,train
"More importantly, our 2017 net asset flows represented long-term organic base fee growth of 7%, evidencing the breadth and diversification of our global investment platform",neg,test
"I think since you merged the scientific and active equity businesses, could you maybe give us an update on the progress of those two working together and maybe any anecdotes or examples of how it has led to improved performance for any specific strategies on either side?",neg,train
"Quarterly technology and risk management revenue grew 15% year-over-year, driving 14% full year growth versus 2016 led by continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for wealth management",neg,train
We accelerated the expansion of our technology portfolio during 2017 with the acquisition of Cachematrix and minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital,neg,train
"Our investments in technology and data will enhance our ability to generate alpha and more efficiently serve clients, resulting in growth in both base fees and technology revenue",neg,train
"Maybe Larry, just to follow-up on a comment you just made briefly about 2018 and active equity inflows, can you talk about, I guess, the backlog or kind of the institutional framework on how it looks today and maybe the consultant discussions of how those have evolved",neg,train
The strength of BlackRock’s 2017 results reflects long-term strategic advantages we've created by constantly investing in our business ahead of our clients’ changing needs,neg,train
"BlackRock generated $367 billion of total net inflows during the year, an increase of over 80% versus our previous record of $202 billion last year",neg,train
These flows reflect the trust we have earned from clients to help solve their most difficult investment challenges and they are the strongest flows we've ever generated in a one year period,neg,train
"This is a growing market and with the interest in it, there's a lot more players that want to be involved in the distribution",neg,train
There are a lot of people that want to get in the game,neg,train
"Sometimes, you get in the game by different offerings you would have at different price levels",neg,train
"Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements",neg,test
We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock’s actual results may of course differ from these statements,neg,train
"As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today",neg,train
BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements,neg,train
It's going to fixed income investors that are using ETFs side by side with their bond portfolios,neg,train
Its portfolio solutions provider that are using it as part of a multi-asset class solution,neg,train
"As an example, an individual with $1000 in 1950 would have around $20,000 today if they saved in a US bank account versus $1 million if they invested in the S&P in 1950",neg,train
"We enter 2018, BlackRock’s 30th year with more than $6 trillion in assets under management",neg,train
Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank,neg,test
"We did have $1 billion of outflows, which were forecasted when we did the restructuring",neg,train
"We actually saw more inflows, we actually forecasted actually a little more outflows, and I would say very clearly the trend for 2018, we will have positive inflows on our active fundamental and scientific equities in 2018",neg,train
"The first part is, I just wondered if you could help us sort of ring fence what the core G&A expense number was for the fourth quarter? And I know, Gary, you had made some sort of broad comments around margins and comp ratios, et cetera",neg,train
"But how are you thinking about sort of the pace of growth on that line, when you sort of normalize off the fourth quarter? And then could you just go back and clarify, I apologize",neg,train
"When you were saying, you said that the equities can increase and you felt like it could come from the alternative allocation, maybe you can just flush that out a little bit",neg,train
"So I don't have the answers yet, but we have many teams at BlackRock focusing on issues around retirement, around the longevity component of retirement, around de-accumulation and I think these are some of the most important questions that have to be raised and hopefully we can design products and meet those types of needs",neg,train
"I would also say, in society, we're not there yet",neg,train
There is not enough debate here in the United States,neg,train
There is not enough debate in Europe or anywhere else about how do we navigate the concept of longevity and retirement and the component of how does one have enough financial literacy to properly prepare for retirement and properly prepare for the moment when they're in the phase of de-accumulation,neg,train
"On the distribution side, we reaffirmed our belief in the long term growth potential of the Mexican market through our recent announcement to acquire Citibanamex Asset Management business",neg,train
"Since BlackRock’s foundings, we have been encouraged -- everyone to act like owners that all employees work hard to instill the principles of our firm’s culture",neg,train
"Rob and I have never worked harder, nor enjoyed our jobs more than ever before and we have no intentions of being here -- we have every intention of being here all the time and no intentions of leaving",neg,train
"So the first quarter of the year, a lot of institutions look at changing their portfolios and diversifying",neg,train
"Obviously, there is a lot of interest in the equity markets right now, because of 2017 and a lot of forecasts for 2018",neg,test
So we are involved in those discussions and of course it really helps to come off a good year in performance in 2017 to be included in those,neg,train
"And over the past two years, $368 billion of inflows in iShares have matched the entirety of the ETF business we acquired from BGI in 2009",neg,train

"Direct fund expense was up $138 million or 18% in 2017, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise",neg,train
"G&A expense increased 12% in 2017, reflecting higher core technology and data spend and the impact of various one-off items, including professional fees related to deal activity, Brexit, MiFID II, and tax reform as well as FX re-measurement expense, increased contingent payments, and purchase price fair value adjustments",neg,train
"I just wanted to jump into another topic with, you talked about the ETFs, they’re increasingly being used by investors for asset allocation decisions and also generating alpha",neg,train

"Arch, we have seen success over the many years now in our performance, in our model based equities",neg,train
"The atmosphere is very strong, so the much better backdrop",neg,train
"So the conversations we're having when you mention consultants, are looking at our products more",neg,train
"And I see -- so I think the environment is very right for us to have better dialog with more clients, where the results should be that we could see more positive inflows",neg,train
"We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, and during 2017 returned approximately $2",neg,train
8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases,neg,train
"1 billion of shares in 2017 and now have repurchased almost 16 million shares over the last five years, representing a 20% unlevered annualized return for our shareholders",neg,train
"Consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2",neg,train
"88 per share, representing an increase of 15% over the prior level",neg,train
"When we combined those two, keep in mind we're also combining the research both in the quantitative method and the fundamental method",neg,train
"And this has also worked very well for us in light of the MiFID II requirements where I’m not sure people are aware, but we have over 400 analysts internally that develop our own research",neg,train
"So we're putting together the quantitative, the fundamental tools, we're putting together the research, the portfolio managers all have access, and what's happening is we're getting much better wholesome alpha from both of the teams",neg,train
"So, so far, I would say it's been a very good success",neg,train
"As we enter 2018, all of us at BlackRock are humbled by the trust our clients have placed on us",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan,neg,train
"I guess we’ll get updates from the rest of the industry and obviously the asset managers as a whole are reasonably well positioned to get the benefit, given relatively high tax rates, but how much of that do you think is going to get competed away and then specifically when it comes to BlackRock, how are you guys thinking internally in terms of reinvesting some of the tax savings and how much of that do you think will have to come in the form of lower fee rates? Thanks",neg,train
"And that's one of the great advantages and that's one of the great advantages that we have related to Aladdin and why so many clients are looking to employ Aladdin, because the need of having greater efficiencies in the operations of trading is becoming more and more important and for those organizations that are not prepared electronically, they have too higher costs",neg,train
"And as fees are coming down and if you don't have those efficiencies, you're going to be left behind",neg,test
"I would like to bring up one point, Alex, because you connected tax reform with fee reductions and I don't see any correlation or connections",neg,train
"And tax reform is obviously a below the line result anyway and fee cuts are above the line, but we systematically review our products and fees and we will continue to systematically look at fees to provide the best value to our clients, but it's totally unrelated to tax reform",neg,train
We also saw some increased contingent payments associated with some prior deals,neg,train
"And as we've talked about before, we need to mark-to-market ongoing contingent payments",neg,train
"That being said, our level of G&A spend has basically remained pretty much constant over the last five years and that's notwithstanding the fact that we've built and leveraged our scale",neg,train
"Beyond digital wealth, technology is enabling more productive engagements with more financial advisors than ever before",neg,train
"Driving accelerated asset and base fee growth across our platform, Blackrock is using better data and technology to scale our own wealth advisory sales teams and equipping them with a better insight about our clients, about their portfolios and giving a much better texture about markets",neg,train
"Let me ask something on, let me go to technology I guess",neg,train
"Can we get a sense from your view on sizing the potential impact of organic growth, particularly in iShares from your technology investments broadly and you mentioned obviously Aladdin Wealth, but also some of the new, the Cachematrix and the effort -- the capital effort in Europe as well and just get a sense of, first of all, I guess, are we seeing traction on those right now in terms of inflows from those products and services? And then secondly, as you build that out over time and clearly you have a competitive advantage in this, how do you see this enhancing the organic growth over the next, say, two to three years",neg,test
"In summary, 2017 was a very strong year for BlackRock",neg,train
Our diversified business model once again delivered industry leading organic growth and consistent financial results,neg,train
"We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit clients",neg,train
60 was up 17% versus 2016 and excluded the impact of a $1,neg,test
3 billion net tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,neg,train
"8 billion non-cash tax benefit related to the revaluation of US deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $477 million repatriation tax expense, which is payable over eight years",neg,train
"Our current analysis suggests a projected tax run rate of approximately 23% for 2018, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recent tax reform legislation",neg,train
"Our Aladdin technology, which we have invested in the -- since the foundation of BlackRock has played a major role in allowing us to scale our own business efficiently over time",neg,train
So the need to invest in longer duration assets has never been greater,neg,train
I think this is one of the causes why the yield curve is so flat when you look at the [indiscernible],neg,train
"Obviously, that's an inflation reflection too, but the demand for long dated assets remains really strong and you look at that at credit spreads and one of the examples why equity markets remains to be very robust",neg,train
"Worldwide, demand for long dated financial assets remains to be strong",neg,train
"Beyond the P&L, investing cash flow to grow the business is another critical component of our growth strategy",neg,train
"Alex, why don’t you begin your question again if you’re on?",neg,train
"So I don't want to suggest it's one thing, but it's a multitude of all the things that we've been investing in, working in, investing in that is creating a better, deeper or consistent dialog with more financial advisors",neg,train
"That's not a delivery system for ETFs, but it is a very strong delivery system for us to connect with banks and the bank channels for them to drive more cash and money market types of products into the BlackRock platform and that's one of the reasons why we had accelerated growth in our cash management platform in 2017",neg,train
"Full year retail net inflows of $30 billion were placed by our broad range of fixed income products, our multi-asset income fund and the indexed equity",neg,train
"BlackRock’s institutional franchise generated a record $55 billion in net flows for the year, positive across alpha seeking and indexed strategies",neg,train
"2017 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, as we raised more than $11 billion in new commitments",neg,train
BlackRock now has approximately $17 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies,neg,train
"And actually, we’re seeing the results of that already in the performance of both sides of the portfolio",neg,train
"If you look out over the last 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, I think it's largely an unchanged position",neg,train
"But the rates of labor inflation, let's say 5% or 6%, are not different to where we were 12 months ago or 18 months ago",neg,train
"Just on land, firstly, when we look at the implied plot cost of your land buying in the first half, I think it's about £48,000",neg,train
"And I think the average for last year was £52,000 or so",neg,train
"Now is there anything we can read on that from that lower plot cost or is it just again mix effects and variations around infrastructure requirements and the other stuff in the mix there? Or are you getting kind of better margins year-on-year, I guess?",neg,train
"So I think I'll just have a stab at both of them, actually",neg,train
"I mean, first of all, in terms of sales rates, I mean, I think a key feature of our announcements in September, November and again this morning has been that we've seen very consistent sales rates year-on-year",neg,test
"Is it simply a function of you having a higher rate of completion in this first 6 months, which is sort of pulling the forward sale ratio down quicker or is there anything else potentially happening in that equation?",neg,train
"I mean, the reality is that if you look at the introduction of the planning policy in 2012, since the planning policy was introduced and revised planning policy in 2012, there is a lot of land that is held by, in particular, land traders where they don't have delivery capabilities",neg,train
"The only additional thing would be that in the first half of the year, our cash spend on land has been slightly above £600 million, so more cash spend in the first half than 50-50 on the £1 billion",neg,train
I don't think that's really different to what we've seen,neg,test
"I mean, if you go back and look at the environment, say, over the last 2 or 3 years, when you look at the combination of labor and materials, then clearly, every company is going to be in a slightly different place, so I can only comment on Barratt",neg,train
"But for the first half of this year, would you advise us to kind of begin more off where you were in the first half of last year or the second half or the full year? Just it has been quite lumpy, I think, from half to half in the past",neg,train
"In the inner zones, as we said during calendar '17, the rates of sale have been slower than we'd seen in calendar '15 or '16, but rates of sale are largely unchanged",neg,train
"And as you know, we've undertaken a couple of bulk sales in the Central London properties over the last 12 months",neg,train
And the slight reduction in the order book doesn't seem to kind of get you to the kind of a flat profile,neg,train
So just wondered if you could just kind of comment around that point?,neg,train
"We had a strong first half, and we're confident we'll deliver a good operational and financial performance for FY '18",neg,train
We'll obviously continue to have a look at the year to June '19,neg,train
"But I think the reality for the year to June '19 at this point in time is probably closer to 4% than to 3%, but still in that range of 3% to 4%",neg,train
The principal drivers you touched on is some increase in material inflation rather than increase in labor inflation,neg,train
And second one really is around the forward sold position,neg,train
"At the AGM, you reported, I mean, has ignored that absolute numbers in a way because they constantly change through the year",neg,train
"But it looks to me as though it's going to be a comprehensive review of the market in England, so looking at London and also looking at regional marketplaces across the country, and I think really trying to understand of what the challenges or restrictions are in terms of output on a per-site basis",neg,train
"And despite that, in the year to June '17, we approved a little over 18,000 plots",neg,train
"So on a pro rata basis for the 12 months, we were well ahead of the 20,000 run rate",neg,train
"And then we come into FY '18 with guidance right from the beginning that we would exceed 20,000 plots",neg,train
"Is there anything unusual in that figure? Is it reflecting sort of higher rates on your exposure to London? And just really, a few more thoughts about how that - how you think that might pan out over the next 12 months, if you can just flesh out for me, that would be great? Thank you",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gregor Kuglitsch from UBS,neg,train
"There's only been one meeting, and the terms of reference are not finalized",neg,train
Jessica and I will now be happy to take any questions,neg,train
"And thirdly, just on the Letwin inquiry, whether - how you see that some - that inquiry progressing and what you think the sort of likely outturn of that might be?",neg,train
"What we have said to government and clearly, the industry has said to government is that we are operating with quite extended lead times",neg,train
"So thinking about committing on land to go through planning, to get on-site that typically, we could be looking at periods of 5 or 6 years from that initial commitment to actually completing on the average site, and therefore, the sooner that the industry receives confirmation about the intentions beyond 2021, the better",neg,test
So if I can just give you a little bit more detail on the numbers,neg,train
Net private reservations per active outlet were in line at 0,neg,train
"We launched 93 developments in the period, and we operated from an average of 376 outlets over the period",neg,train
"That will have absolutely no impact in terms of interest cost because clearly, we have no utilization fees and product placement to note",neg,train
"So we still have the guidance of £50 million total interest, of which £ 15 million is cash for the full year",neg,train
"In terms of the second half, I mean, historically, our second half sales rates have tended to see a tick-up on the first half, so we clearly expect that to continue",neg,train
"And in terms of trends, I mean, I don't think we're going to get into the sort of granular level of, well, last week our sales were like this",neg,train
"But I think the reality is that these are very, very strong sales rates",neg,train
"We're seeing good footfall and strong customer demand, so I think it sets us up well for the second half and, indeed, calendar '18",neg,train
"But on the other hand, I think there's got to be constraint",neg,train
"And we want to ensure that we stick to our operating framework in terms of land bank land, in terms of land creditors and so on",neg,train
Can you give us your view what you think we need to see and what you think the milestones are in the next 6 months or so before we get a decision for the period of longer term? Thank you,neg,train
I think we recognize we've got to be selective about the land that we intake,neg,train
"And we would expect the intake in the second half of the year to be down on the 13,200 plots in the first half",neg,train
"But overall, we will be slightly ahead of that 20,000 for the year",neg,train
"I just want to know why - what therefore is there that sort of stops you doing more than 20,000 plots? I mean, if in the first 6 months, it's been easy enough to get these and actually get them on a slightly better margin appraisal, why doesn't - why aren't there another 13 coming through?",neg,train
"[Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions, I'll turn the call back to your host for any additional or closing remarks",neg,train
"And we would expect our cash position at the year end will be around about £ 500 million, which is in line with how we've guided previously",neg,train
"Yes, I mean, I think that the London completion profile last year, I mean, overall, we obviously saw a reduction - in overall completions last year in terms of London compared to the prior year",neg,train
"Overall, we would expect to see some further reduction in London completions in the current year compared to last year",neg,train
"The delivery profile in unit terms, I think, will be fairly similar",neg,train
"And I guess probably linked to that, if I just think about London completions, are you expecting a similar profile first half, second half to last year? Was it more even this year? So I guess that has implications to margin, coming at it a different way",neg,train
"Wondered if you could comment a bit more on the sales rates, just in terms of the kind of recent trends you've seen",neg,train
"And would you still be expecting the kind of normal seasonal balance during the spring selling season, I know its early stages, but I just wondered what your thoughts were there?",neg,train
"We'll also be back in February with the full half year results, and we'll provide further guidance at that time in terms of the full year",neg,train
I think the extension decision was very much made on the backdrop of how successful Help to Buy had been in terms of proposition for the customer that really allowed the customer demand to be enabled,neg,train
"So clearly, Help to Buy has been hugely positive for housing volumes and building homes",neg,train
"There's no inference, therefore, at all that you think land prices may actually get more expensive in the coming 2 years or harder to buy in the coming 2 years?",neg,train
"And then secondly, I think you talked about approving over 20,000 plots of land post this year",neg,train
"Just wondered, as you look at that and the working capital movements you expect, what you're kind of sort of expecting for the net cash position to look like at the end of June '18? Thank you",neg,train
"Now I think there's always going to be some mix effect in terms of the way that, that is delivered",neg,train
"Should we be expecting land creditor percentage or the gross land bank to be broadly unchanged this year, so again, a sort of increase in the absolute amount? And the last one I had really was, what's happening to incentives at the moment?",neg,train
"When you look at what the government have said, I think that they have said that they recognized that there is some need to make statements for the period beyond 2021",neg,train
"And do we have a timetable of this? Sorry, I ought to know probably",neg,train
"In terms of London market, again, if you go back over calendar '17, I would say no real change, that product at lower price points is selling very well",neg,train
"There's very strong demand at lower price points, and that's clearly a big positive and in large part reflects our focus on land buying in Zones 3 to 6 rather than the inner zones",neg,train
Just wanted to go back on the labor cost inflation issue,neg,train
I was quite surprised by the level of 5% to 6%,neg,train
"You're saying that, that level of 5% to 6% has been consistent for a while",neg,test
It seems to be higher than I had in my mind,neg,train
"(OTCPK:BTDPF) Trading Update Conference Call January 11, 2018  3:30 AM ET",neg,train
"In terms of incentives, then year-on-year incentives would be very consistent",neg,train
So we're not seeing any increase or any particular need to increase incentives,neg,train
"So things like some stamp duty being paid, or stamp duty awaited incentives in Central London has probably become more of a feature of the market in the last 12 months",neg,train
"At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr",neg,train
"It's on the front foot, and we're getting plenty of good opportunities",neg,test
"5% in total, seeing benefits in terms of both mix and also some underlying price inflation",neg,test
"We've delivered another strong first half performance, strong both operationally and financially",neg,train
"So in terms of the net debt position for the first half, we operated actually with a net cash position for the first half of around £100 million",neg,test
"Looking at the full year, I'd expect net - it's a bit broadly neutral net cap to net debt position over the period",neg,test
"I mean, London inflation for labor I think typically has been a bit higher than the average",neg,train
Perhaps inflation in the north of England has been a bit lower than the average,neg,train
"But that overall 5% to 6% is probably good in terms of subcontract labor, clearly",neg,train
The volume of wholly-owned plots is up by 3% year-on-year,neg,train
"I mean, I would expect that the bulk of the inquiry will be completed in the first 6 months of the year",neg,train
There's not been a positive policy in the last rolling 12 months to sort of systematically increase the amount of land because you fear that the price may move away from you 2 years down the track?,neg,train
"And maybe the answer is that in the first half, you had a much higher rate of conversion from strategic or there were some regions that you were expressly looking to build the forward position",neg,train
"But just sort of just more generally, any deeper thoughts as to why, in particular, you've had this sudden spurt of buying it?",neg,train
"What I would add is we set out in September very clearly what we're focused on in terms of margin and the margin levers we're pulling, and we remain focused upon those",neg,train
"As Barratt celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2018, we are very pleased to say we have built over 450,000 homes across England, Scotland and Wales since 1958",neg,test
"We remain focused on driving operational improvements through the business, as well as delivering modest growth in wholly-owned completions",neg,test
"In summary, the business is performing well, and we are operating in a supportive market environment",neg,train
"But in percentage terms at the AGM, you were talking about forward sold position up 8",neg,train
"But your sales ratio, your site per week appears to have been remarkably constant",neg,train
"We see that the land market remains very attractive, and we have as a result approved over 13,200 plots of land during the period and we continue to expect to approve more than 20,000 plots for FY '18 as a whole",neg,train
"As we previously stated, we target a land bank of around 4",neg,test
"Given those relatively higher figures you're talking about there, does that encourage the business or encourage you to look more at alternative methods, more timber and steel frame than you're currently doing? Or is that not such an issue when you're thinking about labor cost?",neg,train
I think some of the other guys have obviously asked some bits,neg,train
"I mean, obviously, you covered the labor issues there, David",neg,train
"But would you sort of still have overall cost, build cost running in the sort of 3% to 4%, so materials sort of, I suppose, sort of 2% to 3% within that?",neg,train
"Now the joint ventures, there's only 12 sites within the joint ventures, so clearly, that's dependent upon where those joint ventures are with regards to build and sale",neg,train
"On a wholly-owned basis, the plots are up 3%, of which private plots are up by 4%",neg,train

"I mean, in terms of build cost, I mean, the short answer is we're expecting to June '18 to be in line with the guidance of 3% to 4%",neg,train
Morning and Happy New Year to all of you there,neg,train
"I'm just after, I suppose, slightly deep thoughts on two of the issues which are partially being touched on",neg,train
"First of all, on land, you obviously had this quite significant increase in approval rate in the first half",neg,test
And the message you've given is that inference that the current news [ph] is stronger in terms of the exceeding your hurdle rates that you can get,neg,train
"But if you look at the combination of labor and materials, we've seen a very, very benign environment in terms of material price inflation really up until calendar '17",neg,test
"So therefore, the combination of labor and materials has been more about materials at zero",neg,train
"And certainly, in probably calendar '15, materials is negative in terms of inflation, i",neg,train
", net reductions, but blended with labor has given us an overall inflation number, and we were originally running at 2% to 3%, and we're now running at 3% to 4% on an overall basis",neg,train
[Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Andy Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch,neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"So we have seen some underlying inflation in the first half of the year, which is clearly helping in terms of ASP",neg,train
"But we're not looking for anything dramatically different on a year-on-year basis, so we're coming off an ASP last year of £275,000",neg,train
"Well, Jessica will obviously talk about the sort of average net debt position in the first half of the year",neg,train
"In terms of ASP, I mean, as you know, Chris, historically, what we've tended to do is not give any detailed guidance on ASP",neg,train
We more tended to look at the ASP in the land bank,neg,train
"And we published an ASP in the land bank as at June '17, that total ASP private and affordable was just a little above £265,000",neg,train

"So at each reporting event, we've been pretty much bang in line with the prior year rates",neg,train
So I think we're very comfortable with where we are in terms of sales rates coming through the first half,neg,train
[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Aynsley Lammin from Canaccord,neg,test
So the reality is that availability is a challenge in terms of bricklayers and roof tilers,neg,train
", building dozens of units, not trialing on single units but trialing across whole sites in relation to steel frame and large-format block",neg,train
So the moving number has more been the price than the volume?,neg,train
And then the second one was really around the P&L margins in 2018,neg,train
"Perhaps you could just help us, when we think about the first half profits, obviously, if I look at gross margin last year, it was 20",neg,train
Our next question comes from Clyde Lewis from Peel Hunt,neg,train
"So in terms of the land market, I mean, Kevin, I think overall, we'd say that the land market is very positive",neg,train
"And I think you need to put it in the context that post the referendum, so July, August '16, we had a very definite pause in the market",neg,train
"So we were really out in the market, and some of our peers were out in the market for at least a couple of months",neg,train
"And I think in terms of margin, we've set out, as Jessica touched on, we set out that we're seeking to improve margin, whether that be on a year-on-year basis or half-year-on-half-year basis",neg,train
"But clearly, any improvements, when you look at consensus, any improvements in margin will obviously be modest",neg,train
"Today, as you know, we're issuing our trading update for the 6 months ended the 31st of December",neg,train
"It's certainly a factor, and I think it's both about availability and inflation",neg,train
"I think if you look at the square footage of housing that the industry is delivering, we will definitely be delivering square footage of housing at equivalent levels to where we were in 2007",neg,train
"And overall, we're building far more houses than we were building back in 2007",neg,train
"Good morning Yes, so I think I'll - let me start off in terms of the land spend, and then Jessica can just talk in terms of gross margin",neg,train
"But first of all, in terms of land spend, I mean, I don't think there's anything that can particularly be read into £48,000 compared to £52,000 because I think, inevitably, there's just always going to be some mix effect in relation to that, i",neg,train
", we can't say, well, the cost of land is down by 10%",neg,train
We would expect to see a little bit of underlying inflation and a little bit of mix,neg,test
"But we don't have the significant mix benefits that we've had previously as we've transitioned, for example, from flats to houses and more large family houses",neg,train
"I mean, I think that mix shift is really behind us",neg,train
"A couple of questions from me, really, I suppose as much as three",neg,train
"Just wondered if you might say something about labor availability and how you manage that process through this year, anything to say on London trends at all?",neg,train
"Can you give us your view on the potential extension of Help to Buy timing? Obviously, we've had the announcement late last year about funding out to 2021, that's my understanding",neg,train
"I mean, Jessica will touch on it, but the only thing I would say on the forward sales is I think, looking at the position in November to the position this morning, I think it's important to look at both volume, i",neg,train
"I mean, in terms of gross margin, we're not giving any guidance in terms of margin or profit today",neg,train
"Clearly, it's just a trading statement, and we'll be back very shortly in February with the margin numbers and the profit numbers",neg,train
I think the other point to know is that Help to Buy very much has cross-party support,neg,train
"So the Labour Party had said in their manifesto that they would run it through until 2027, albeit with some modifications, and more recently have said that they would perhaps look at household income restriction as one of those modifications",neg,train
So I think the political backdrop does seem to recognize that an extension would be beneficial in terms of housing volumes,neg,train
"So clearly, in terms of a plots basis, the plot numbers are up, which is in line with what we're expecting for the year in terms of modest volume growth",neg,train
"In terms of the ASP within the private element of the forward order book, that has reduced slightly year-on-year, which is because there are more regional plots within that part of the forward order book",neg,train
"So when you look at bricklayers, roof tilers, something like 5% to 6% overall, that would be the kind of rates we'd see coming through",neg,train
Bricklayers and roof tilers have higher percentages than 5% or 6% if you backtrack over the last few years,neg,test
And I think we are now comfortable that we are always exceeding that 20% gross margin and 25% return on capital employed,neg,train
"Our sales rate has been consistent, in line with a strong comparative last year",neg,train
"4 billion, up 2%, and we ended the half year with net cash of £165 million",neg,train
"And also, when you look at the large housebuilders and ourselves being no exception, we have significant strategic land interest which will come through to the market over the next 2, 3, 5 years",neg,train
"And therefore, we see that there is still a lot of land held by the land traders that won't come through to the market over the next 2 or 3 years",neg,train
So we see that plenty of supply from that side of the equation,neg,train
"Charlie, I'm just going to run through those three questions myself",neg,train
"So first of all, in terms of labor availability, I would say that it's broadly an unchanged position",neg,train
So we know that the availability of securing labor and labor inflation is clearly one of the key challenges that's been facing the industry over the last 2 or 3 years,neg,test
"Just - I mean, first of all, I think just to Help to Buy in context, I mean, I know that everyone is aware that Help to Buy launched back in 2013, and it was originally scheduled to run through until 2016",neg,train
And the government made a decision initially to extend to 2020 and then to 2021,neg,train
"Now if we look at it on a plots basis, total plots, including joint ventures, are up by 4%",neg,train
"Morning, David, Jessica Just two quick ones from me, please",neg,train
"One is just about average debt in H1, if you could comment on that? And the second one is really just about the average sales price move in the first half",neg,train
"I think you were guiding to kind of a broadly flattish profile for the full year, by memory, but there was obviously quite a significant move in the first half",neg,test
We're currently anticipating our Phase III program to have three different studies,neg,train
That study is designed to be the primary registrational trial,neg,train
"So, let me spend a couple of moments on each one of these",neg,train
"On exercise capacity, the traditional framework for exercise capacity has been six-minute walk",neg,train
It's fraught with challenges as some of you might know,neg,train
There's a tremendous amount of standard deviation in dealing with six-minute walk,neg,train
"There's a lot of geographic differences in dealing with six-minute walk, there's gender differences in dealing with six-minute walk",neg,train
"As some of you know, prostacyclin is still considered the gold standard for the treatment of PAH and, in fact, intravenous prostacyclin is the only therapeutic that's ever shown impact on [right heart] [ph] changes and mortality, and remains the gold standard",neg,train
"So, for those of you that followed the story over the last 12 to 18 months, we spent the first six months as a new management team coming into Arena",neg,train
Really focused on what we really considered a reset of the business,neg,train
It was some work that had to get done to reset the operating expense base of the company and rebuild some key infrastructure around clinical development,neg,train
"In the case of etrasimod, we see about a 95% recovery within a week",neg,train
This is not half-life driven; ozanimod actually has a shorter half-life than we do,neg,test
We think there's something else going on possibly related to tissue partitioning and a [depot-ing] [ph] of ozanimod in tissues,neg,train
"So, we're very excited about this profile of the compound from a patient safety point of view",neg,train
"etrasimod, we believe, has optimal selectivity, does not hit the P2 and the P3 receptor",neg,train
We've shown similar lymphocyte reductions to the competing products at our high dose two milligrams,neg,train
"And at that high dose, we have seen no first dose bradycardia and no changes in some of the other key safety parameters of the compound",neg,train
And we've began a couple of studies already in things like primary biliary cholangitis,neg,train
"We're currently in the Phase II study for ulcerative colitis and again, that data readout is this quarter",neg,train
"So, talking a little bit about why we believe etrasimod has the potential to be a best-in-class agent",neg,train
"As some of you might know, there are five receptor subtypes in the S1P category",neg,train
"One, four, five are associated with positive activity on certain immune cell types",neg,train
"Two and three are associated with a series of downstream implications that are deleterious, and we believe that avoiding two and three is imperative to having a clean pharmacology profile and creating broad clinical utility",neg,train
We reported out what we believe is unprecedented Phase II efficacy data in the middle of 2017,neg,train
"It's unprecedented in its magnitude and more importantly, it's unprecedented in its magnitude in patients with dual background therapies",neg,test
"So, we consider a contemporary patient population where the bulk of our patients were on both ERAs and PDE-5s and we demonstrated a change from baseline of just approximately 20% in pulmonary vascular resistance",neg,train
"As you recall, ozanimod utilizes a titration schedule to avoid first-dose bradycardia",neg,train
We've demonstrated both a titrated and non-titrated regimen with etrasimod and we saw no difference and minimal first-dose bradycardia effects,neg,train
We have two other important pharmacodynamic advantages for the compound,neg,train
"This is important from a clinical perspective in patients who are experiencing rapid flares, so we think that the rapidity of onset here will be important in the clinical setting",neg,train
"So previously, we have disclosed some context for how we're thinking about our Phase III study design and we'd laid out four priorities that we thought were important in order to win in the marketplace",neg,test
"So, as we kind of think through where we were in 2016 as a company, hitting a very difficult reset button, brining on whole new management team and about 90% of the management team is new and about 80% of the staff of the company is new",neg,train
"We had a successful from vantage points, there's still lot more work to be done and some of the key catalysts are upcoming in 2018",neg,test
"Furthermore, we knew that we have an extended half-life 24 hours of a once-a-day dosing and that really creates a really nice, smooth curve for the compound and about a three and a half fold improvement in peak-to-trough compared to Selexipag",neg,train
"So, these are the first indications we have that we were on to something pretty exciting and a chance to make an impact in this grievous illness for patients",neg,train
"When we first joined the company, we asked some important questions about where the CB2 receptor is expressed, in which types of pain indications we have to go after, and we were struck by the density and the knowledge base that existed about CB2 in the gut, there are CB2 receptors that are all throughout the GI tract, they are also in visceral effort nerves and throughout the entire [ph] nervous systems",neg,train
"So, the way we really think about this is you've got the first-generation compounds really, fingolimod in this case, limited clinical utility, largely focused on MS, commercially still quite lucrative, but really restricted in how many indications you can go after by both its -- first, it was bradycardia as well as a series of other adverse events seen with fingolimod",neg,test

We also expect Phase II data from etrasimod which is our -- what we believe is a potential best-in-class S1P modulator for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and we expect that data as well in Q1,neg,train
"It's been an exciting year for the company and I would just start by thanking the investors who support us through the year, the sell-side analysts that supported us through the year, and the ongoing conversation we have at the market place",neg,train
There's been a lot of changes in the company and it's been a fantastic year as we go forward here,neg,train
"As some of you know, these products are dosed to maximum tolerated dose, so these are to be expected, in fact, or indicator that we're hitting the prostacyclin pathway appropriately",neg,train
"The safety and tolerability of ralinepag is commensurate with other products in the category, adverse events are on target",neg,train
"In 2017, we completed a fairly exhaustive analysis of the autoimmune landscape",neg,train
"We valued it systematically 100,000 pieces of literature and identified about 80 commercially viable, clinically attractive targets for the S1P class",neg,train
"So, finally, let me quickly touch on APD371, fully restricted, highly selective full agonist",neg,train
"So, there is a tremendous amount of -- tremendous body of evidence out there suggesting that endocannabinoids are dysregulated in Crohn's disease",neg,train
"So, we expect to have that data Q1, Q2 and again, we look forward to sharing with that with you as soon as we have it",neg,train
In our hands -- and this is published data that was published in 2017,neg,train
"In our hands, using immunofluorescent microscopy assay, we can clearly see that all the major products in the category both in development and commercially available all internalize the S1P1 receptor",neg,test
And we think this is -- this off-target activity that we've seen with other products and category have really translated to limited clinical utility for the competing compounds,neg,test
"So, let me see if I can make this work",neg,train
We refer you to our last SEC documents for full disclosure on our multiple risk factors,neg,train
We reported Phase II data in the middle of last year as I mentioned and we're preparing for a Phase III,neg,test
"However, intravenous therapy is, of course, difficult to administer for a broad subset of patients and, as a consequence, the other products in category really resort to pumps and different ways to try to get this drug into patients",neg,train
We're developing it for multiple autoimmune disorders and we think again this has a chance to be a potentially best-in-class agent,neg,train
We think the real application here is in visceral pain and our initial indication is just a first step in a long process and in thinking through multiple visceral pain indications for the compound,neg,train
"ozanimod came on the market -- came on the scene a few years back with a company called Receptos, acquired then by Celgene",neg,train
"It is a more selective S1P modulator, but still as I showed on the previous slide, internalizes the P2 receptor",neg,train

I will share with you today a little more context into how we are thinking about the Phase III program,neg,test
We're waiting for some agency guidance and we look forward to sharing with you more details throughout this first quarter,neg,train
Probably more important than the onset of action is the off-time,neg,train
"We've previously report on -- reported on half-life, what we think a much more important way of thinking about off-time is thinking about recovery time of T-lymphocytes",neg,train
"So, in the event there's a serious infection and the clinician needs to take a patient off the product, in the case of ozanimod, two weeks after, only about 60% recovered",neg,train
"During the 24 -- 25-week full safety assessment period, discontinuation rates were the same between [Indiscernible], between active and placebo and serious adverse events were higher in the placebo rate as well as seen two deaths in placebo and none in active",neg,train
"And then finally, in the comparative head-to-head study, for competitive reasons, we won't be discussing or disclosing any further details until we're ready to go on that study",neg,train
"We do plan to start these studies in relatively synchronous -- in a synchronous fashion, so we'll be launching these studies literally right on top of each other in the back end of 2018",neg,train
We need further clarity from the agencies and we look forward to sharing details of these with you sometime later this quarter,neg,test
"As previously mentioned, we've initiated a couple of important studies",neg,train
"We initiated early in 2017, a small pilot study in pyoderma gangrenosum",neg,train
"And importantly, we've initiated the back end of 2017 a study in PBC",neg,train
"It is a T-cell mediated condition, the destruction of bile ducts is CD4 CD8-positive T-lymphocyte-driven, so we work far upstream from the [Indiscernible] modulators, creating another novel path in PBC, so we're very excited about this study and again, look forward to sharing this data as it's available",neg,train
The story of ralinepag really begins with some of the non-clinical evidence that we saw when we first joined the company in the middle of the year -- middle of 2016,neg,train
The product binds very strongly to the IP receptor agonist,neg,train
"And in comparison to MRE-269, which is the active metabolite of Selexipag from Johnson & Johnson, we've demonstrated about a six and a half fold improvement in potency",neg,train
"For those of you that have been following the stock this year, we began the year really starting to talk about how we believe this was a next generation potentially best-in-class oral selective prostacyclin IP receptor agonist for the treatment of PAH",neg,train
"As I mentioned, we're in a 12-week Phase II study",neg,train
"We're looking at two doses, one milligram and two milligram versus placebo",neg,train
This study is fully enrolled kind of middle of November of 157 patients,neg,train
"And again, we expect data in Q1 of this year",neg,test
"And finally, a head-to-head study against other oral prostacyclin in the category such as Orenitram and Selexipag",neg,train
It's going to be driven by the fact that we're going to need an expanded label over time,neg,train
"That drives improvement in the three hallmarks of the disease, basal relaxation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, and inhibition of platelet aggregation",neg,train
"So, this was the first indication we have that we had potentially a best-in-class compound",neg,train
"But with that, I'll turn it over to Arena's CEO, Amit Munshi to present",neg,train
"We're looking at -- on top of six-minute walk, we're looking at other quantitative measures of exercise capacity, including cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and we'll be discussing these with the agency and coming back to you with some more details in terms of how we're planning to take that forward",neg,train
"Time to clinical worsening, our second study, is a conventional outcomes study",neg,test
We'll be looking at a range of potential outcomes here,neg,train
and Europe and to begin to find key parameters to begin to enrich for events with some fantastic data out there and we'll be coming back again with some more details on that study,neg,train
"Morgan Healthcare Conference January 10, 2018  5:30 PM ET",neg,train
The promise of etrasimod to be a best-in-class agent is driven by the fact that we have the cleanest receptor pharmacology profile,neg,train
That approval is based on study ONO-12 which was conducted in Asian patients,neg,train
It resulted in approval in Japan and with our partner-owner we are currently commercialization that asset,neg,train
But we do have data in our hands from other studies which points to the efficacy of Opdivo in combination regimens in both second-line gastric cancer and first-line gastric cancer,neg,train
"Growth 8% for the total company and importantly in the first nine months of the year prioritized brands grew 32%, so that's really the result of strong execution from a commercial and medical perspective",neg,test
"Last year, we completed study 214 which is the only Phase 3 trial to demonstrate an overall survival advantage for a new agent",neg,train
In this case the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy first line versus sunitinib in intermediate and poor risk patients we have a PDUFA date in April of this year and we look forward to continue to advance this program,neg,train
"So, last year we did receive proof-of-concept data in one of our key programs, and I’m referring to our TYK-2 inhibitor",neg,train
And I’d like to tell you a little bit more about that program,neg,train
"We’ve not discussed that extensively so far, but we are going forward",neg,train
Business development of course is part of a broader capital allocation strategy and it is a core element of our capital allocation strategy,neg,train
"We increased our dividend and we remain very committed to our dividend, and at the same time opportunistically we were able to execute a significant share repurchase program last year",neg,train
"I'm actually quite proud of the work we’ve done advancing translational capabilities in the company, that's a bit more reason for us",neg,train
And you’ll see a number of agreements there that are truly aimed at strengthening our work on biomarkers and our translational capabilities and work,neg,train
"I’d like to cover a third example, which is a little bit different",neg,train
Again I think these can be as well $1 billion plus opportunity for Opdivo,neg,test
Gastric cancer is another tumor where the unmet need is very high,neg,train
", in Europe and Asia, and we do have proof-of-concept through an approval in Japan in third-line gastric cancer",neg,train
"So, looking at our capital allocation strategy and I know, in light of the many questions we’ve already received related to tax reform and what changes there, let me just reiterate",neg,train
"One of the things that I'm proud of is the investment we’ve been able to make in our R&D organization in strengthening our capabilities in the areas of tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers and translational medicine in general",neg,train
We've been able to recruit great talent in the company last year to strengthen capabilities in this area,neg,train
We are also going beyond PD-1 as the only biomarker and in study 9LA we are proactively randomizing patients based on tumor mutation burden because of the growing importance of additional biomarkers as a means of stratifying patients in first-line lung cancer,neg,test
"So, our TYK-2 program is a potential first-in-class, very selective inhibitor of TYK-2 discovered internally",neg,train
"As you may know, it addresses two important pathways that are relevant to immune diseases",neg,train
"The IL-12/23 pathway and the interfering pathway, both are important",neg,train
Our target here is to aim for a product that can have a biologic like efficacy with the tolerable safety profile and obviously the convenience of overall dosing,neg,train
I want to point to the early stop of two important clinical trials for overall survival,neg,train
This is the 238 adjuvant melanoma trial and the 214 first-line renal cell trial very important addition to the data set for Opdivo,neg,train
"There are some deals we did, licensing or acquisitions where we broadened our focus from an R&D perspective",neg,train
"If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at: transcripts@seekingalpha",neg,train
"Morgan Healthcare Conference January  9, 2018  1:00 PM ET",neg,train
Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha,neg,test

) So our reproduction policy is as follows: You may quote up to 400 words of any transcript on the condition that you attribute the transcript to Seeking Alpha and either link to the original transcript or to www,neg,train
And we have an approval in second-line in the U,neg,train
", in fact, the product was approved at the end of last year and in just very few months Opdivo has become the Standard of Care in second-line",neg,train
"This is a small opportunity in second-line, but it is an important indicator of the potential role of Opdivo and importantly of the need for new agents in these diseases",neg,train
"So this is a large program, there will be multiple data read-outs between this year and the beginning of next year",neg,train
I know many of you are focused on the possibility of an interim analysis on 1A,neg,train
"We've discussed that it is event driven, we expect it to happen in the early part of this year",neg,train
We've not conducted interim analysis we have not seen data and we will update the market when that happens,neg,train
We’re going to jump right into the next presentation here,neg,test
"From the company we have Giovanni Caforio, the company’s Chairman and CEO",neg,train
"It starts with having conducted the development plan that has enabled us to demonstrate the best profile in the class as you know Eliquis is the only NOAC to have demonstrated improvement versus warfarin and stroke, bleeding and all cause mortality",neg,train
"One of the reasons why we are in a strong position as a company, one of the important reasons why we are executing very strongly is really our commitment to our strategy which we maintained constantly with discipline over the last 10 years",neg,train
"And actually as the external environment has evolved and the company has changed, our strategy has become even more important",neg,train
"Last year, in business development was a very successful year",neg,train
And we executed a number of activities in business development,neg,train
Last year we discussed extensively with you the role that FGF21 may have in the treatment of an important disease called NASH,neg,train
"This is a disease with large prevalence, very high unmet medical need with a five-year survival of approximately 10%, sub-optimal treatments, and it is an area in which we’ve already been able to establish a leadership position in second-line where we have over 50% market share",neg,train
"We’ve executed well internationally and as a result of that you see the growth in international markets, I expect that to continue both in the U",neg,train
And then as the market grow many patients that are currently been treated with aspirin or not treated enter into our potential pool,neg,train
"And as the market growth, the leading agent with a strong leadership position in TRx and NBRx is clearly going to be growing disproportionately",neg,train
but quite frankly I’m proud it’s true in many markets around the world,neg,train
"And finally, we’ve seen a significant growth in the number of clinical collaborations in the company",neg,train
"And I’d like to point to the fact that three of them, the collaboration with Incyte, Exelixis, and Seattle Genetics, those are all now Phase 3 collaborations",neg,train
So first it is clear that we are at a time in which science is moving extremely fast,neg,train
And in oncology I'm quite proud that we have a very broad pipeline,neg,train
And most importantly one that we deliberately built over the years to address really important questions in oncology,neg,train
alone last year continued to start new registrational trials 14 study starts in 2017 alone and probably most importantly we had great progress with our early pipeline,neg,train
And I'm quite proud to report that the program is on track with its execution,neg,train
At the same time we have maintained a discipline on our total resources and total operating expenses,neg,train
"First, our first-line lung cancer program and let me start by reminding all of you what we are trying to accomplish here",neg,train
We are asking a number of important questions in first line lung cancer,neg,train
"The role of Opdivo, the role of the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, the combination of Opdivo and chemotherapy",neg,train
"We are investigating in study 9LA novel regimens with an induction with chemotherapy followed by an I-O, I-O regimen and obviously we reaching at new agents",neg,train
It remains a key pillar of the strategy of the company,neg,train
"And finally, I’m happy that we’ve made great progress with the evolution of the operating model of the company",neg,train
"First of all, we are moving faster and more effectively",neg,train
"Last year when I was here, I had an opportunity to discuss with all of you the beginning of a process of transformation of the company",neg,train
"I think and I’m confident, this can also be depending on the data over $1 billion opportunity for Opdivo",neg,train
"Similar elements here, this is a disease of high prevalence associated with poor outcomes with five-year survival of approximately 5%, sub-optimal, current regimens",neg,train
In this case many patients have treated in parts of world like obviously the U,neg,train
", Europe and countries in Asia where we have an established presence and capabilities",neg,train
"Now I often get a question is how much growth still ahead for Eliquis, and the answer is there is very significant growth ahead for Eliquis because while NOAC are rapidly penetrating the warfarin market from a TRx perspective in the U",neg,test
"When you look at NBRx that is already three quarters of the markets so right there, there was clearly opportunity for growth",neg,test
One example is the early entry into the adjuvant setting in melanoma,neg,train
Our study compared Opdivo to Yervoy which was the previously established Standard of Care in adjuvant melanoma and it’s a good example of our work across different segments of oncology,neg,train
"So in summary when I think about Eliquis, we have done a great job in 2017 continuing to strengthen the brand",neg,test
There is really good momentum from a total market growth perspective,neg,train
There is good momentum from a share perspective and I expect Eliquis to continue to be an important driver of growth for the company going forward,neg,train
I’ll just point to the progress we are making with our anti-LAG-3 where we decided last year we were going to three things,neg,train
We wanted to further understand the role of LAG-3 as a biomarker,neg,train
What’s even more important is the decision we made a few years ago to invest significantly in real-world data,neg,train
We set an ambitious goal to obtain data from approximately 1 million patients in the real world,neg,train
We are well on our way to achieving that objective,neg,train
We presented real world evidence at several congresses in the last two to three years and that evidence strengthens not only the efficacy of Eliquis but also the cost effectiveness of the agent and is positioning Eliquis very favorably with payers around the world,neg,train
"So this is an example of a $1 billion franchise plus which we think we are building with Opdivo, in this case the data is in hand and we are in full execution",neg,train
The growth prospects ahead of us in 2018 and beyond,neg,train
"And so, we are very focused on the first-line gastric cancer opportunity",neg,train
"Our strategy there is all about combination and we are investigating the role of Opdivo plus Yervoy, but also the role Opdivo plus chemotherapy with the potential data readout for study 649 in 2019",neg,train
"So again, for the franchise, I’m using as an example of the many opportunities for growth for our Opdivo business in the near and in the medium term",neg,train
"Let me just remind you, we have not disclosed our earnings for the fourth quarter and the full-year",neg,train
So many of my comments will relate to the performance of the company in the first nine months of last year,neg,train
"Since the product was launched in 2014, we have been successful in building a franchise of approximately $5 billion in sales",neg,train
"We received and executed effectively against over 250 launches globally, received 14 indications in the U",neg,test
"alone in 11 tumor types, and we have a rapidly growing number of ongoing registrational trials in a large number of tumors",neg,test

"Good morning everyone, thanks for the opportunity Chris to present at JPMorgan this year again",neg,train
It's a great time for us to present strong performance for the company in 2017 driven by really strong execution on the commercial side and R&D side and good momentum for growth coming into 2018,neg,train
"Looking at our business in 2017, it was a year of growth for Opdivo in both the U",neg,train
"Many patients in fact, don’t even get treated because of the lack of efficacy of existing therapies",neg,train
We have encouraging data to show the potential activity of Opdivo in first-line from an existing study and we are conducting a very important trial which should read at the end of this year on the role of Opdivo compared to sorafenib in the first-line setting in Phase 3,neg,train
"So, that’s a second example of a potentially big franchise for Opdivo with better readouts in the very near term",neg,train
"Now, here at JPMorgan, let me just make a couple of comments about business development",neg,test
"First of all, it remains a really important priority for us",neg,train
"I know that many of you in the room maybe work with companies that are we are meeting with, that we are patterning with, that we are in discussions with",neg,train
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research,neg,train
"And so as we think about $30 million of synergies over the five year period, really review 60% will result from operational cost savings activities, logistics, physical distribution perhaps some back office efficiencies and potential shared services, while maintaining strong forward facing presence",neg,train
"We think the other 40% results from revenues and margin enhancement with about two third around cross sell opportunities, extension of service, in time geographic expansion",neg,train
"The forward 12 month projected results provided within our presentation represent a good proxy for recent historical performance as supported by the quality of earnings report prepared by our independent auditors, allowing our investors to evaluate the financial impact of the pending acquisition",neg,train
"I just want to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking with many of you in the coming days, and we’ll be back together on January 25th on our quarterly results",neg,train
I need to further work on it but I would say it's -- service and repair will approach 20% plus of the overall revenues,neg,train
"And while that may not take a depth of service and service time, it does take a qualified technician with expertise to do some of those assemblies and combination",neg,train
So depending on how you think about those from a definitional standpoint,neg,train
But I think we know it approaches 20% perhaps could be more,neg,train
"Ryan, fiscal year at June, we'll see a blended rate for fiscal year '18",neg,train
"I think it is a function of the product line, the technical capabilities and requirements of the channel",neg,train
"The value added services, I think industries and segments develop norms and standards, and they've done a very nice job operating in that environment",neg,train
"But if you look back at their history, they've also done a nice job of growing those margins over the years, 20 to 30 basis points and that with a view of clear opportunities to continue to do that, going forward",neg,train
"Our engineers in fluid power are doing the engineering, the power requirements to move fluids throughout all of these systems",neg,train
"They're around these systems and these products, they were just not always specking the flow, the instrumentation the control of it, which is a little downstream in those applications",neg,test
So we think this is a great combination for us with OEMs but also in the industrial after market around these systems,neg,train
"So when we think about product overlap, very little in doing it, perhaps a little around some of the pumped category",neg,train
I'd like to recognize our business teams for their efforts on this transaction and getting us to this point and just days away from celebrating Applied's 95th anniversary,neg,train
We're focused on our customers and energized by our momentum in the pursuit of realizing our full potential,neg,train
"So I believe that work is well underway, it's not been all delivered, all the opportunities haven't been captured but that progress is showing in the results and we feel confident together",neg,train
We think in essence no selling team should have to have cold call,neg,train
"Now Tom and I are still going to encourage them to make cold calls where appropriate, but there's likely going to be an opening or reception that we can have to a high number of customers",neg,train
"I guess, one housekeeping can you give us FCX D&A?",neg,test
"I would say, first off, I think it's very comparable to how we operate within our fluid power business",neg,train
"And while there is a technical application understanding and requirement to that, it does not bring over burdensome SG&A requirements to do that",neg,train
"You need the expertise, you need the service and repair capabilities, you need the facilities, you need the local presence but that really looks and operates a lot like our fluid power",neg,train
"Turning now to slide eight, I'll recap key highlights of the transaction",neg,train
"As noted in our press release this morning, purchase price is approximately $768 million, representing 11",neg,train
"3 times multiple of projected over 12 month EBITDA for the business, excluding one-time transaction cost",neg,train
And would you care to give a estimate or range of what you think the EPS accretion could be in fiscal '19?,neg,test
"If we turn to page five, we cover the highlights including the anticipated 12 month performance, the close proximity of the headquarters of the two businesses and also FCX industry leading position in this highly fragmented market",neg,train
"flow control market is a $33 billion market today with mid-single digit growth and projected to reach 44 billion by 2022 with highly engineered products leading the way, representing nearly 50% of the market",neg,train
Key covenants include the maximum permitted net leverage ratio of 4,neg,train
"25 times following acquisition Holidays with subsequent step downs, and an interest coverage ratio of covenants of 3 times EBITDA",neg,train
Given the positive cash generation profile of the business and benefit of lower go forward U,neg,train
"federal tax rates, we expect to return to leverage under 3 times EBITDA for the end of year two",neg,train
"We think especially with fluid power and flow control, those are natural synergies",neg,train
Then I think we augment those that are more flow products with other resources,neg,train
"We do not bought down our selling teams on vendor managed inventory and consumables replacements, right",neg,train
And I think it's going to be welcome by many other selling teams,neg,train
"With that, we'll open up the lines for your questions",neg,train
